item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary the principal business of the bank is attracting deposits from consumers and small businesses and investing those deposits together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  primarily in income property real estate secured loans 
the bank commenced originating and purchasing income property real estate secured loans through a network of mortgage brokers located within the state of california in in  the bank will fund substantially all of the loans that it originates or purchases through  deposits  fhlb advances and internally generated funds 
deposit flows and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates of interest primarily on competing investments  account maturities and the levels of savings in the bank s market area 
the bank s ability to originate and purchase loans is influenced by the general level of product available 
the bank s results of operations are also affected by the bank s provision for loan losses and the level of operating expenses 
the bank s operating expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  premises and occupancy expenses  and other general expenses 
the company s results of operations are also affected by prevailing economic conditions  competition  government policies and other actions of regulatory agencies 
critical accounting policies we have has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions management uses are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at balance sheet dates and the company s results of operations for future reporting periods 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses and the valuation allowance on deferred taxes are the critical accounting policies that require estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the company s financial statements that are most susceptible to significant change 
for further information  see business allowances for loan losses and note to the consolidated financial statements 
average balance sheet 
the following tables set forth certain information relating to the company for the years ended december    and the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
average balances are measured on a daily basis 
the yields and costs include fees  which are considered adjustments to yields

net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance on our loans receivable  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in the average balance on the participation contract 
interest income on the participation contract declined by million  or  primarily due to the sale or termination of the three residuals during that the participation contract is comprised of 
interest income on loans receivable increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income on loans was primarily the result of an increase in the average loan balance from million in to million in  which was partially offset by a basis points decrease in the average yield on loans 
the decrease in loan yield is primarily due to the origination of short term adjustable rate multi family loans coupled with the lower overall interest rate environment and the prepayment of the bank s discontinued higher yielding subprime loans 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the  increase primarily reflects an increase in the average balance of deposits and fhlb advances and other borrowings of million and million  respectively  during the year  which was partially offset by a basis points decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities that was due to the decrease in market interest rates and the pay off of the company s million senior secured note and million of subordinated debentures during the fourth quarter of net interest income our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by several factors including the level of  and the relationship between  the dollar amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relationship between repricing or maturity of our variable rate and fixed rate loans and securities  and our deposits and borrowings  and the magnitude of our non interest earning assets  including non accrual loans and foreclosed real estate 
net interest income before provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in net interest income before provision for loan losses is primarily due to the million increase in the company s interest income 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the company decreased to during the year ended  compared with during the same period in the company s yield on average earning assets was for the year ended december   compared with for the same period in total interest income increased million  or  while total interest expense increased by only  million  or 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the current year provision for loan losses was primarily due to the growth in our loan portfolio as well as improvement in our asset quality 
nonperforming loans decreased by from million in to million in  with a corresponding decrease in net charge offs from million in to  in total loans receivable in increased million  or  over noninterest income noninterest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to a million gain from the sale or termination of the three residual interest components of the participation contract and an  increase in loan servicing fee income primarily from an increase in prepayment penalties of  these increases were partially offset by a  decline in other income due to fewer recoveries on assets written off in prior years and a  decrease in net gains on the sale of loans due to fewer loans being sold in noninterest expense noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in noninterest expense was principally due to an increase in compensation and benefits of million  which was partially offset by decreases in all other noninterest expense categories 
the increase in compensation and benefits was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees from full time employees at december  to full time employees at december  income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to a tax provision of  for the year ended december  compared to a benefit of  for the year ended december  the company had income before income taxes of million for the year ended december  compared to income before income taxes of million for the year ended december  the company increased the deferred tax asset by reducing its deferred tax valuation allowance by million and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance is due to management s forecast of taxable earnings  based on assumptions regarding the company s growth in the near future 
as the company achieves continuous taxable income and if the earning projections show that the company will have the ability to use its net operating loss carry forwards  then all or part of the remaining valuation allowance for deferred taxes of million will be eliminated 
comparison of operating results for the year ended december  and december  general for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million or per diluted share  compared with a net income of million or per diluted share for the same period in the  decrease in net income was primarily the result of a lower income tax benefit million during as compared to during  the company increased its deferred tax asset by million  as compared to  during however  income before tax benefit increased by  from  in to million in the decline in net income also reflected a reduction in interest income million  which was partially offset by lower interest expense million  a decline in the provision for loan losses  an increase in noninterest income  and a decrease in noninterest expense interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  is primarily due to a decrease in the average balance and yield on our investment securities 
interest income on investment securities and other interest earning assets declined by million  or  due to a million decrease in the average balance of such assets 
interest income on loans receivable increased  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income on loans was primarily the result of an increase in the average loan balance from million in to million in that was partially offset by a basis points decrease in the average yield on loans interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease primarily reflects a basis points decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits that was due to the decrease in market interest rates  which was partially offset by an increase in the average balance of deposits from million in to million in interest expense on other borrowings increased  in as compared to  primarily due to an increase in the average balance of borrowings of million 
net interest income net interest income before provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the  decrease in net interest income before provision for loan losses is primarily due to the decline in the company s net interest margin from in to in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the company decreased to during the year ended  compared with during the same period in the company s yield on average earning assets was for the year ended december   compared with for the same period in total interest income decreased million  or  while total interest expense decreased million  or

noninterest income noninterest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the  increase was primarily due to a  increase in net gain from the sale of loans  which is primarily due to a sale of million of loans in at a loss of  and a  increase in other income  which was due to a number of factors including  in rental income the bank received for leasing unused space at its corporate offices 
these increases were partially offset by a  decline in loan servicing income due to average fewer loans being serviced by the bank in as compared to and a  decrease in net gains on the sale of investment securities due to changes in prevailing market conditions and the types of our securities which we were selling in as compared to noninterest expense noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the  decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a decrease in premises and occupancy of  and a decrease in other expenses of  which was partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits of  the increase in compensation and benefits was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees from full time employees at december  to full time employees at december  income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to a tax benefit of  for the year ended december  compared to a benefit of million for the year ended december  the company had income before income taxes of million for the year ended december  compared to income before income taxes of  for the year ended december  the company increased the deferred tax asset by reducing its deferred tax valuation allowance by  and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance is due to management s forecast of taxable earnings  based on assumptions regarding the company s growth in the near future 
as the company achieves continuous taxable income and if the earning projections show that the company will have the ability to use its net operating loss carry forwards  then all or part of the remaining valuation allowance for deferred taxes of million will be eliminated 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets of the company were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in total assets of the company was primarily the result of a million increase in net loans 
the increase in net loans was the result of million in new adjustable rate loans funded during this increase was partially offset by million of loan principal repayments and prepayments 
total liabilities of the company were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to increases of million in other borrowings and million in deposits 
total deposits at december  were million compared to million at december  in addition  fhlb advances increased by million as the company increasingly relied on such borrowings to fund its lending and investing activities 
at december  and  our stockholders equity amounted to million and million  respectively 
the increase in stockholders equity was due primarily to million of net income for the year ended december  liquidity our primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans  deposits and fhlb advances 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we seek to maintain a level of liquid assets to ensure a safe and sound operation 
our average liquidity ratios were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the liquidity ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of cash balances plus unpledged securities by the sum of deposits that mature in one year or less plus transaction accounts and fhlb advances 
our liquidity is monitored daily 
we believe the level of liquid assets is sufficient to meet current and anticipated funding needs 
liquid assets of the bank which are comprised of cash and unpledged investments represent approximately of total assets at december   of total assets at december  and of total assets at december  at december   we had two unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks for million each and which had a balance at year end 
also  in march  the bank established a three year million credit facility which is secured by investments pledged to salomon brothers 
we also have a line of credit with fhlb allowing us to borrow up to of the bank s total assets as of december  or million  million of which was outstanding as of such date 
the fhlb advance line is collateralized by eligible loan collateral 
at december   we had approximately million of loans pledged to secure fhlb borrowings 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures at december  at december   we had million in outstanding commitments to originate or purchase loans compared to and million at december  and  respectively 
the bank s loan to deposit and borrowing ratio was  and as of december   and  respectively 
certificates of deposit  which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december   totaled million 
we expect to retain a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit at maturity 
capital resources the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
at december   the bank s leverage capital and risk based capital amounted to million and million  respectively 
as a result  the bank exceeded the capital levels required to be considered well capitalized at that date 
pursuant to regulatory guidelines under prompt corrective action rules  a bank must have total risk based capital of or greater  tier risk based capital of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater to be considered well capitalized 
at december   the bank s total risk based capital  tier risk based capital and leverage ratios were   and  respectively 
contractual obligations and commitments the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and to meet required capital needs 
the following schedule summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations fhlb borrowings other borrowings certificates of deposit operating leases total contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual commitments with off balance sheet risk as of december  payment due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands other commitments unused equity lines of credit total commitments impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts except with respect to securities classified as available for sale which are carried at market value without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and nullifies the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in restructuring  which recognized a liability for an exit cost at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
requires that the initial measurement of a liability be at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions  which requires that most financial services companies subject their intangible assets to an annual impairment test instead of being amortized 
sfas no 
applies to all new and past financial institution acquisitions  including branch acquisitions that qualify as acquisitions of a business  but excluding acquisitions between mutual institutions 
all acquisitions within the scope of the new statement will now be governed by the requirements of sfas nos 
and certain provisions of sfas no 
were effective on october   while other provisions are effective for acquisitions on or after october  the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and accounting pronouncement board apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
while sfas no 
does not amend sfas no 
to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for annual financial statements for years ending after december   and for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we account for the compensation cost associated with our stock option plans under the intrinsic value method  and consequently  the alternative methods of transition will not apply to us 
the additional disclosure requirements of the statement are included in our financial statements 
in management s opinion  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  fasb revised sfas and issued it under its new name  share based payment 
this statement eliminates the alternative to use apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method of accounting discussed in the previous paragraph 
instead  the revised statement generally requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of stock options  or other equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
this cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  generally the vesting period 
the bank must adopt this statement in for all new stock option awards as well as any existing awards that are modified  repurchased or cancelled 
in addition  the unvested portion of previously awarded options will also be recognized as expense 
the bank is unable to estimate the impact of this statement on its financial condition and results of operations as the decision to grant option awards is made annually on a case by case basis and  accordingly  the bank cannot estimate the amount of stock awards that will be made in subsequent to year end  the company s board of directors approved acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock options previously awarded to employees  officers  and directors  effective on march  the accelerated options were issued under the pacific premier bancorp  inc stock incentive plan the plan and the pacific premier bancorp  inc long term incentive plan the plan 
the board took this action with the belief that it is in the best interest of shareholders as it will reduce the company s compensation expense in future periods 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and loan commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans held for sale  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires an issuer to classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
is generally effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin and in december fasb issued a revision fin r 
fin and finr address the requirements for consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
business trusts formed by bank holding companies to issue trust preferred securities and lend the proceeds to the parent holding company have been determined to not meet the definition of a variable interest entity and therefore may not be consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
bank holding companies have previously consolidated these entities and reported the trust preferred securities as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the company s investment in the trust is carried as an investment in other assets and the funds borrowed from the trust are presented as junior subordinated debt 
in january  the fasb issued eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investors eitf  and in march  fasb issued an update 
eitf addresses the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain debt and equity securities 
eitf aids in the determination of impairment of an investment and gives guidance as to the measurement of impairment loss and the recognition of disclosures of other than temporary investments 
eitf also provides a model to determine other than temporary impairment using evidence based judgment about the recovery of the fair value up to the cost of the investment by considering the severity and duration of the impairment in relation to the forecasted recovery of the fair value 
the march update to eitf includes guidance for the transition period and effective dates of disclosure requirements 
in march  the fasb also issued two proposed fasb staff positions fsp fsp eitf issue a  which gives additional guidance on the determination of impairment for debt securities impaired because of interest rate and or sector spread increases  and fsp eitf issue b  which delays the disclosure effective date for debt securities impaired because of interest rate and or sector spread increases 
the comment deadline for the proposed fsps was october   and the application and effective dates of portions of eitf are deferred until the issuance of fsp eitf issue a and fsp eitf issue b  which have been delayed for further deliberation 
the adoption of eitf and fsp eitf issues a and b are not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition or operating results of the company 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment to opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas no 
eliminates certain differences in the guidance in opinion no 
as compared to the guidance contained in standards issued by the international accounting standards board 
the amendment to opinion no 
eliminates the fair value exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
such an exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in periods beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in periods beginning after december  management does not expect adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact  if any  on the company s financial position or results of operations 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business 
if any of the events described in the following risk factors occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have a limited operating history under our new business strategy that makes it difficult to predict our future prospects and financial performance 
we had not substantially implemented our community based banking model  including our new lending strategy focused on originating multi family and commercial real estate loans until we will continue to introduce new products consistent with this model in the future 
we have only recently become profitable and there can be no assurance that our strategy will continue to be a profitable one for us 
although we realized net income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  we incurred a loss of million for the year ended december  we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability in future periods 
the failure to remain profitable may reduce the value of investment in our common stock 
our multi family residential and commercial real estate loans are relatively unseasoned  and defaults on such loans would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   our multi family residential loans amounted to million  or of our total loans 
at december   our commercial real estate loans amounted to million  or of our total loans 
our multi family residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios consist primarily of loans originated after june  and are  consequently  unseasoned 
in addition  such loans originated after june  have an average loan balance as of december  of  in the case of multi family loans and  in the case of commercial real estate loans  so that a default on a multi family or commercial real estate loan may have a greater impact on us than a default on a single family residential loan which is generally smaller in size 
further  the payment on multi family and commercial real estate loans is typically dependent on the successful operation of the project  which is affected by the supply and demand for multi family residential units and commercial property within the relevant market 
if the market for multi family units and commercial property experiences a decline in demand  multi family and commercial borrowers may suffer losses on their projects and be unable to repay their loans 
defaults on these loans would negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and financial prospects 
we may be unable to successfully compete in our industry 
we face direct competition from a significant number of financial institutions  many with a state wide or regional presence  and in some cases a national presence  in both originating loans and attracting deposits 
competition in originating loans comes primarily from other banks and mortgage companies that make loans in our primary market areas 
we also face substantial competition in attracting deposits from other banking institutions  money market and mutual funds  credit unions and other investment vehicles 
in addition banks with larger capitalizations and non bank financial institutions that are not governed by bank regulatory restrictions have large lending limits and are better able to serve the needs of larger customers 
many of these financial institutions are also significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we have  and have established customer bases and name recognition 
we compete for loans principally on the basis of interest rates and loan fees  the types of loans that we originate and the quality of service that we provide to our borrowers 
our ability to attract and retain deposits requires that we provide customers with competitive investment opportunities with respect to rate of return  liquidity  risk and other factors 
to effectively compete  we may have to pay higher rates of interest to attract deposits  resulting in reduced profitability 
in addition  we rely upon local promotional activities  personal relationships established by our officers  directors and employees and specialized services tailored to meet the individual needs of our customers in order to compete 
if we are not able to effectively compete in our market area  our profitability may be negatively affected 
our origination of multi family and commercial real estate loans is dependent on the mortgage brokers who refer these loans to us 
our primary method of originating multi family and commercial real estate loans is through referrals by mortgage brokers 
during  two mortgage brokers have referred to us approximately of all the multi family and commercial real estate loans in our loan portfolio 
although we have in house account managers who have the responsibility of developing relationships with additional mortgage brokers which may refer us the types of loans we target  should we not be successful in developing relationships with additional mortgage brokers and should we lose referrals from one or more mortgage brokers on whom we depend for a large percentage of our multi family and commercial real estate loans  our loan originations could be substantially less than we anticipate  thus reducing our anticipated income from these loans 
interest rate fluctuations  which are out of our control  could harm profitability 
our profitability depends to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
any change in general market interest rates  whether as a result of changes in the monetary policy of the federal reserve board or otherwise  may have a significant effect on net interest income 
the assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions 
moreover  in periods of rising interest rates  financial institutions typically originate fewer mortgage loans adversely affecting our interest income on loans 
further  if interest rates decline  our loans may be refinanced at lower rates or paid off and our investments may be prepaid earlier than expected 
if that occurs  we may have to redeploy the loan or investment proceeds into lower yielding assets  which might also decrease our income 
we may experience loan losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses 
we try to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting the loans  nevertheless losses can and do occur 
we create an allowance for estimated loan losses in our accounting records  based on estimates of the following industry standards  historical experience with our loans  evaluation of economic conditions  regular reviews of the quality mix and size of the overall loan portfolio  regular reviews of delinquencies  and the quality of the collateral underlying our loans 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb any specifically identified losses as well as any other losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
however  changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  which are beyond our control  may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates 
if the actual loan losses exceed the amount reserved  it will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 
in addition  the ots  as part of its supervisory function  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
such agency may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan losses  based on their judgments  which may be different from those of our management 
any increase in the allowance required by the ots could also hurt our business 
upon exercise of the warrant  shareholders will experience significant dilution in their shares of common stock 
in  a warrant the warrant was issued in conjunction with a private placement 
the holder of the warrant has the right to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  which shares  once exercised  would represent approximately of our issued and outstanding shares as of december  the warrant is currently exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock has been significantly higher than per share for the last three fiscal years and at december   the closing price of our common stock was per share 
upon exercise of the warrant  existing shareholders will experience significant dilution of the shares of our common stock that they hold 
adverse outcomes of litigation against us could harm our business and results of operation 
we are currently involved in litigation involving former subprime mortgage sales and other actions arising in the ordinary course of our business 
we also anticipate that  due to the consumer oriented nature of the subprime mortgage industry in which we previously actively operated and uncertainties with respect to the application of various laws and regulations in some circumstances  we may be named from time to time as a defendant in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state consumer lending or other similar laws and regulations 
a significant judgment against us in connection with any pending or future litigation could harm our business and results of operations 
poor economic conditions in california may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our loans and decreased value of the assets we hold as collateral 
a substantial majority of our assets and deposits are generated in southern california 
as a result  poor economic conditions in southern california may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio 
in addition  demand for our products and services may decline 
further  a downturn in the southern california real estate market could hurt our business 
our business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in southern california 
a downturn in the southern california real estate market could hurt our business because the vast majority of our loans are secured by real estate located within southern california 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by real estate located in california  the substantial majority of which are located in southern california 
if there is a significant decline in real estate values  especially in southern california  the collateral for our loans will provide less security 
as a result  our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate would be diminished  and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
real estate values in southern california could be affected by  among other things  earthquakes and other natural disasters particular to southern california 
we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
instead  we intend to reinvest our earnings in our business 
in addition  in order to pay cash dividends to our shareholders  we would most likely need to obtain funds from the bank 
the bank s ability  in turn  to pay dividends to us is limited by federal banking law 
it is possible  depending on the financial condition of the bank and other factors  that the ots could assert that payment of dividends by the bank is an unsafe or unsound practice 
federal law imposes conditions on the ability to acquire control of our common stock at specified threshold percentages  which could discourage a change in control 
acquisition of control of a federal savings bank or its holding company requires advance approval by the ots 
under federal law  the acquisition of more than of our common stock would result in a rebuttable presumption of control and the ownership of more than of our voting stock would result in conclusive control 
depending on the circumstances  the foregoing requirements may prevent or restrict a change in control of us 
our business may be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate 
we are subject to extensive federal and state legislation  regulation and supervision 
recently enacted  proposed and future legislation and regulations have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on the financial services industry 
some of the legislative and regulatory changes may benefit us 
however  other changes could increase our costs of doing business or reduce our ability to compete in certain markets 
anti takeover defenses may delay or prevent future transactions our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  among other things divide the board of directors into three classes with directors of each class serving for a staggered three year period  provides that our directors must fill vacancies on the board  permit the issuance  without shareholder approval  of shares of preferred stock having rights and preferences determined by the board of directors  provide that stockholders holding of our issued and outstanding shares must vote to approve certain business combinations and other transactions involving holders of more than of our common stock or our affiliates  provide that stockholders holding of our issued and outstanding shares must vote to remove directors for cause  and provide that record holders of our common stock who beneficially own in excess of of our common stock are not entitled to vote shares held by them in excess of of our common stock 
in addition  steven r 
gardner  our president and chief executive officer  has an employment agreement which provides that  in the event of a change of control in which mr 
gardner s employment is terminated  mr 
gardner will be entitled to severance payments equal to two times his annual base salary plus an amount equal to his incentive bonus for the previous year 
these provisions in our certificate of incorporation  by laws and mr 
gardner s employment agreement could make the removal of incumbent directors more difficult and time consuming and may have the effect of discouraging a tender offer or other takeover attempts not previously approved by our board of directors 
we are dependent on our key personnel our future operating results depend in large part on the continued services of our key personnel  including steven r 
gardner  our president and chief executive officer  who developed and implemented our new business strategy 
the loss of mr 
gardner could have a negative impact on the success of our new business strategy 
in addition  we rely upon the services of john shindler  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  eddie wilcox  our executive vice president and chief lending officer  and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any employee nor have we entered into an employment agreement with any other employee other than mr 
gardner 
on january   the company and bank each entered into a three year contract with mr 
gardner on january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk management 
the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of appropriate risk given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines through the establishment of prudent asset and liability concentration guidelines 
through such activities  management seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates 
management monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
the bank s board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the bank s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the bank s capital in various interest rate scenarios 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
net portfolio value 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model that estimates the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
a npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline the sensitivity measure 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the bank utilizes a market value model prepared by the ots the ots npv model  which is prepared quarterly  based on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports filed with the ots 
the ots npv model measures the bank s interest rate risk by estimating the bank s npv  which is the net present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and any off balance sheet contracts  under various market interest rate scenarios  which range from a basis point increase to a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
as of december  and  the bank s sensitivity measure  as measured by the ots  was and basis points  respectively  as a result of a hypothetical basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates 
this would correspondingly result in a  increase for and a million reduction for  respectively  in the npv of the bank 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value npv the following tables show the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at december   assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of   and basis points bp as of december  dollars in thousands npv as of portfolio net portfolio value value of assets change in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp bp bp bp bp bp bp static bp bp bp bp the model was not able to calculate meaningful results due to the low interest rate environment 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv requires the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the bank s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to  does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income  and will differ from actual results 
selected assets and liabilities which are interest rate sensitive 
the following table provides information regarding the bank s primary categories of assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for the year ended december  the information presented reflects the expected cash flows of the primary categories by year including the related weighted average interest rate 
the cash flows for loans are based on maturity and re pricing date 
the loans and mortgage backed securities that have adjustable rate features are presented in accordance with their next interest repricing date 
cash flow information on interest bearing liabilities such as passbooks  now accounts and money market accounts also is adjusted for expected decay rates  which are based on historical information 
in addition  for purposes of cash flow presentation  premiums or discounts on purchased assets  and mark to market adjustments are excluded from the amounts presented 
all certificates of deposit and borrowings are presented by maturity date 
maturities and repricing at december  year year year year year thereafter dollars in thousands selected assets investments and federal funds average interest rate mortgage backed securities fixed rate average interest rate loans fixed rate average interest rate loans adjustable rate average interest rate selected liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts average interest rate certificates of deposits average interest rate fhlb advances average interest rate lines of credit and subordinated debentures average interest rate the bank does not have any foreign exchange exposure or any commodity exposure and therefore does not have any market risk exposure for these issues
