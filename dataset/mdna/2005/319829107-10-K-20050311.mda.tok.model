these forward looking statements are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to changes in general economic and financial market conditions  the corporation s ability to effectively carry out its business plans  changes in regulatory or legislative requirements  changes in competitive conditions and continuing consolidation of the financial services industry 
although management believes the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  actual results could differ materially 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as of the date hereof 
the corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
effective may   the corporation acquired all of the outstanding shares of ga financial  inc gaf  and effective december   the corporation acquired all of the outstanding shares of pittsburgh financial corporation pfc 
in addition  the corporation acquired all of the outstanding shares of strategic capital concepts  inc scc and strategic financial advisors  inc sfa  effective march  as required under the purchase method of accounting  the results of gaf  pfc  scc and sfa have been included in the corporation s financial statements since their respective acquisition dates 
in october  sfa was merged into scc and the name was changed to first commonwealth financial advisors  inc financial statement amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the presentation format used in the reclassifications had no effect on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and significant estimates the corporation considers accounting policies and estimates to be critical to reported financial results if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and the different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or the changes in the accounting estimates from period to period could have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations 
accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses are considered to be critical because they are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates by management 
the allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense  which represents management s best estimate of probable losses that are inherent in the existing loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance includes amounts calculated in accordance with fasb statement no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended by fasb statement no 
 and amounts determined in accordance with fasb statement no 
accounting for contingencies 
management and the corporation s board of directors review the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for credit losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the corporation s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include an assessment of individual problem loans  delinquency and loss experience trends  and other relevant factors 
while allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans  the total allowance is available for all loan losses 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for credit losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trend and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
the loan portfolio represents the largest asset category on the consolidated balance sheet 
classified loans on the primary watch list are analyzed to determine the level of potential loss in the credits under current circumstances 
the potential loss that is established for these classified loans is based on careful analysis of the loan s performance  the related collateral value  cash flow considerations and the financial capability of any guarantor 
primary watch list loans are managed and monitored by assigned account officers within the corporation in conjunction with senior management 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and significant estimates continued the process of determining the allowance also considers special circumstances which may warrant an additional allowance 
an additional allowance provides management with the opportunity to estimate additional potential allowance amounts which may be needed to cover specific factors 
the special factors that management currently evaluates consist of portfolio risk or concentrations of credit and economic conditions 
portfolio risks include unusual changes or recent trends in specific portfolios such as unexpected changes in the trends or levels of delinquency  unusual repossession activities or large levels of unsecured loans in a portfolio 
the corporation also maintains an unallocated allowance 
although the unallocated allowance was significantly reduced during as a result of methodology enhancements  the unallocated allowance is still used to cover any factors or conditions that may cause a potential credit loss but are not specifically identifiable or considered in the methodology that was defined above 
these factors include  but are not limited to potential judgment or data errors or factors not yet considered in the corporation s methodology 
accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets are also considered to be critical because the assumptions or judgment that was used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities that were acquired as part of past acquisitions were subjective and complex 
as a result  changes in these assumptions or judgment could have a significant impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation adopted fasb statement no 
fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  fas no 
requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually and written down and charged to results of operations only in periods in which the recorded value is more than the estimated fair value 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities that was used to record goodwill was based either on quoted market prices or provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information was not available  estimates were made in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the assumptions that were used in the cash flow modeling were subjective and are susceptible to significant changes 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually and written down and charged to results of operations in periods in which their recorded value is more than their estimated fair value 
although goodwill has not been written down since the adoption of fas no 
 changes in future assumptions based on changing economic conditions could result in impairment which could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations net income was million in  a decrease of million from the results of million 
this compared to net income of million in the most significant component of the decrease in the period was the previously announced penalty related to the prepayment of fhlb long term advances 
this penalty was million or million after taxes 
also impacting the decrease in was merger and integration costs that were not present in the period and a gain on the sale of two branches during the change in net income for the period reflected an increase in security gains compared to the corresponding period of in addition  the effects of restructuring costs and a litigation settlement negatively impacted net income for a partial recovery from insurance for the claim related to the litigation settlement was received in diluted earnings per share was for compared to and for and  respectively

net interest income increased million in the period compared to after declining million in compared to interest income and interest expense both increased during the period due to increases in the volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as average yields continued to decline over levels 
during  both interest income and interest expense declined compared to levels primarily as a result of the dramatic decrease in interest rates that began in and continued into net interest margin net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets declined to for  a decrease of basis points compared to  and a decrease compared to in the year to year decrease in the margin was due to asset yields declining more quickly than the cost of funds 
in the lower interest rate environment  deposit costs begin to reach a floor while asset yields have a bigger cushion and can continue to decline 
the corporation uses computer simulation to help manage interest rate risk 
the corporation s use of computer simulation is described in the interest sensitivity section of this discussion

c loan income includes net loan fees of  in   in and  in d average balances do not include reallocations from noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing demand deposits into savings deposits which were made for regulatory purposes 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued net interest income continued interest and fees on loans increased million for compared to after declining million for compared to the increase in interest and fees on loans during was due to an increase of million in average loan balances 
the volume increase was due in large part to the loans that were acquired in the acquisitions of pfc and gaf 
commercial loan growth was primarily due to internal growth 
volume increases in were noted in all loan categories with the exception of leases  which is a product that the corporation no longer offers 
volume increases were also recorded in the period compared to during  the corporation took advantage of the lower interest rate cycle and changed the mix of the loan portfolio 
average mortgage loans declined during as consumers refinanced their loans at near record levels 
the corporation continued to offer competitive mortgage loans but generally sold them immediately after origination along with the related servicing rights 
the corporation has since started to retain fixed rate mortgages with maturities of years or less as well as adjustable rate mortgages 
average commercial and municipal loans offset the decline in mortgage loans during  primarily in shorter term and variable rate lending 
in addition  included increases in average installment loans over levels 
the corporation has continued to capitalize on lending opportunities with small to mid sized commercial borrowers  including loans generated through its preferred small business administration sba lender status 
the corporation has consistently been one of the top small business lenders in pennsylvania 
the declining rate environment has continued to negatively impact interest and fees on loans 
during compared to  the increase in average loan volumes was not enough to offset the reduced interest income caused by declining yields 
tax equivalent loan yields fell basis points during compared to after declining basis points during from the levels 
interest income on investments increased million in compared to after declining million in compared to both years reported increases in average investment balances with decreases in yields on investment securities 
the most significant volume increases during were related to us government agency securities 
average investment securities included increases due to pfc for the full year of and gaf since may  yields on investments for continued to decline  falling basis points to 
yields for fell to compared to for as with the loan category  the increase due to average investment security volumes surpassed the loss due to the declining yields  but during the increase due to volume was not enough to offset the reduced interest income caused by declining rates 
yields in the period compared to decreased for all investment securities with the exception of asset backed securities 
during compared to  all categories of interest income on investments were negatively impacted by interest rate changes with the largest decline being registered in the us government agency category 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued net interest income continued prepayment speeds of mortgage backed securities mbs declined in after accelerating in when interest rates continued to decline 
interest rate changes have a direct impact on prepayment speeds 
as interest rates increase  prepayments tend to decline and average lives of mbs increase 
as interest rates decrease  prepayment speeds tend to increase and average lives of mbs decline  which accelerates the amount of premium amortization that is realized  further reducing the yields in current periods 
using computer simulation modeling  the corporation tests the average life and yield volatility of all mbs under various interest rate scenarios on a continuing basis to insure that volatility falls within acceptable limits 
the corporation holds no high risk securities nor does the corporation own any securities of a single issuer exceeding of shareholders equity other than us government and agency securities 
interest on deposits dropped million in compared to after a decline of million in compared to the decrease in both periods was largely due to the lower interest rate environment 
the cost of deposits declined basis points in compared to decreases in time deposit yields were partially offset by increases in yields on more non maturity deposits  such as savings and interest bearing demand deposits 
average deposits increased by million in compared to and included increases in all categories due to pfc for the full year of and gaf since may  the deposit mix continued to change in as clients registered a preference for savings products  while time deposits dropped due to the prospect of rising interest rates 
during its management of deposit levels and mix  the corporation continues to evaluate the cost of time deposits compared to alternative funding sources as it balances its goals of providing clients with the competitive rates they are looking for while also minimizing the corporation s cost of funds 
interest expense on short term borrowings rose million during after rising thousand during both years reflected increases in interest expense due to increases in the average volumes of short term borrowings 
the period also reflected increases in interest expense due to increases in yields  while reflected decreases in interest expense due to decreasing yields 
average short term borrowings increased million in compared to and increased million for compared to the period included an increase due to the inclusion of short term borrowings that were acquired with the gaf acquisition on may  the period also included an increase in short term borrowings which were used to replace a portion of the million of long term fhlb advances that were paid before their maturity 
refer to note other long term debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt prepayment 
the increase in the average short term borrowings during was due in part to million of long term debt that matured during the fourth quarter of and was replaced with short term borrowings 
in addition  the increase in short term borrowings during can be attributed to an alco strategy implemented to mitigate the risk of further declines in net interest income first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued net interest income continued resulting from a low or declining interest rate environment 
this increase in short term borrowings funded the purchase of us government agency securities maturing in approximately years 
interest expense on long term debt increased by million during compared to after a decrease of million for compared to the period 
the period recorded decreases in interest expense due to declining average balances of long term debt and declining yields  while the period included decreases in interest expense due to declining yields that were offset by increases in interest expense due to increases in average balances of long term debt 
the increases in volume during were due in large part to the acquisitions of pfc and gaf 
in addition  subordinated debentures in the amount of million were issued during march these subordinated debentures along with the subordinated debentures of million that were issued during december were used to fund the acquisition of gaf in may refer to note subordinated debentures to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of subordinated debentures that are included in long term debt 
average long term debt for decreased by million compared to this was due in part to the million of long term debt that matured during the fourth quarter of that was replaced by short term borrowings 
the interest rate on long term debt decreased basis points during compared to the rate reduction was anticipated in connection with the prepayment of million in fhlb long term advances during the third quarter of the corporation was able to replace these advances with million in other lower rate fhlb advances with maturities ranging from two to six years 
the remaining million was replaced with short term borrowings

provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses is an amount added to the allowance against which credit losses are charged 
the amount of the provision is determined by management based upon its assessment of the size and quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance in relation to the risks inherent within the loan portfolio 
the provision for credit losses decreased million for when compared to the decrease in the provision reflects the trend in improvement of nonperforming loans  net charge offs and lower levels of the allowance for loan losses allocated to larger impaired credits

the increase in nsf fees is due to the growth of the high performance checking products for consumer and business clients as well as the inclusion of pfc and gaf 
in addition  the increase in nsf fees is due in part to better management of the collection process to ensure that fee waivers are kept to a minimum 
management strives to implement reasonable fees for services and closely monitors collection of those fees 
the period included a million gain which occurred when first commonwealth bank  a wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant  sold two of its branch offices

the corporation expects to open three new branch offices in growth areas of washington and allegheny counties as well as renovate or relocate offices in existing markets 
the execution of these initiatives may continue to impact occupancy and other expenses in future periods 
furniture and equipment expenses increased million to million in after an increase of thousand to million in increases during both periods were largely due to continued increases in depreciation expense some of which was related to the inclusion of pfc and gaf since the acquisition dates 
outside data processing expense increased million for the period to million compared to million for the period and million for data processing expense increases during were due in part to the acquisitions of pfc and gaf 
additional expenses were incurred until the pfc and gaf systems  some of which were processed through an outsourced processing vendor  were converted to the systems that are provided by a subsidiary of the corporation

the preceding table also excludes the corporation s cash obligations upon maturity of certificates of deposit whose maturities are described in note interest bearing deposits to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the corporation s off balance sheet commitments as of december  commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts  however  since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or only partially used  the total amounts of these commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 
dollar amounts in thousands footnote reference amount commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit total lending related commitments commitments to extend credit include unfunded loan commitments as well as the undrawn portions of revolving and closed end lines of credit as of december  the contractual provisions of these commitments normally include fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  specific interest rates and clauses indicating that funding is contingent upon borrowers maintaining stated credit standards at the time of loan funding 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party 
in the event that the client does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  the corporation would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the corporation could be required to make is represented by the contractual first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued aggregate contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements continued amount of the commitment 
if the commitment is funded  the corporation would be entitled to seek repayment from the client 
the corporation s policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of the corporation s ability to efficiently meet normal cash flow requirements of both borrowers and depositors 
in the ordinary course of business  funds are generated from deposits primary source and the maturity or repayment of earning assets  such as securities and loans 
as an additional secondary source  short term liquidity needs may be provided through the use of overnight federal funds purchased  borrowings through the use of lines available for repurchase agreements and borrowings from the federal reserve bank 
additionally  the corporation s banking subsidiary is a member of the federal home loan bank and may borrow under overnight and term borrowing arrangements 
the sale of earning assets may also provide an additional source of liquidity 
in addition to the previously described funding sources  the corporation also has the ability to access the capital markets 
liquidity risk stems from the possibility that the corporation may not be able to meet current or future financial obligations  or the corporation may become overly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the corporation maintains a liquidity risk management policy to manage this risk 
this policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity and quantifies minimum liquidity requirements based on board approved limits 
the policy also includes a liquidity contingency plan to address funding needs to maintain liquidity under a variety of business conditions 
the corporation s liquidity position is monitored by the asset liability management committee alco 
the corporation s long term liquidity source is a large core deposit base and a strong capital position 
core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity a bank can have due to the long term relationship with a deposit customer

these securities are classified as securities available for sale 
while the corporation does not have specific intentions to sell these securities  they have been designated as available for sale because they may be sold for the purpose of obtaining future liquidity  for management of interest rate risk or as part of the implementation of tax management strategies 
as of december   securities available for sale had an amortized cost of  million and an approximate fair value of  million 
gross unrealized gains were  thousand and gross unrealized losses were  thousand 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity continued based upon the corporation s historical ability to fund liquidity needs from other sources  the current available for sale portfolio is deemed more than adequate  as the corporation does not anticipate a need to liquidate the investments until maturity

interest sensitivity market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates or equity prices 
the corporation s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results principally from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities  changes in the relationship of rate indices and the potential exercise of freestanding or embedded options 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to maintain an appropriate balance between the stable growth of income and the risks associated with maximizing income through interest sensitivity imbalances 
while no single number can accurately describe the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income  interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps  when measured over a variety of time periods  can be informative 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest sensitivity continued an asset or liability is considered to be interest sensitive if the rate it yields or bears is subject to change within a predetermined time period 
if interest sensitive assets isa exceed interest sensitive liabilities isl during a prescribed time period  a positive gap results 
conversely  when isl exceeds isa during a time period  a negative gap results 
the cumulative gap at the day repricing period was negative in the amount of  million or of total assets at december  a positive gap tends to indicate that earnings will be impacted favorably if interest rates rise during the period and negatively when interest rates fall during the time period 
a negative gap tends to indicate that earnings will be affected inversely to interest rate changes 
in other words  as interest rates fall  a negative gap should tend to produce a positive effect on earnings and when interest rates rise  a negative gap should tend to affect earnings negatively 
the primary components of isa include adjustable rate loans and investments  loan repayments  investment maturities and money market investments 
the primary components of isl include maturing certificates of deposit  money market deposits  savings deposits  now accounts and short term borrowings 
the following table lists the amounts and ratios of assets and liabilities with rates or yields subject to change within the periods indicated as of december  and dollar amounts in thousands days days days cumulative days loans investments other interest earning assets total interest sensitive assets certificates of deposit other deposits borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities gap isa isl gap total assets first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest sensitivity continued days days days cumulative days loans investments other interest earning assets total interest sensitive assets certificates of deposit other deposits borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities gap isa isl gap total assets although the periodic gap analysis provides management with a method of measuring current interest rate risk  it only measures rate sensitivity at a specific point in time  and as a result may not accurately predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates or net interest income 
therefore  to more precisely measure the impact of interest rate changes on the corporation s net interest income  management simulates the potential effects of changing interest rates through computer modeling 
the income simulation model used by the corporation captures all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments  accounting for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these variables include prepayment speeds on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  cash flows from loans  deposits and investments and balance sheet growth assumptions 
the model also captures embedded options  such as interest rate caps floors or call options  and accounts for changes in rate relationships as various rate indices lead or lag changes in market rates 
the corporation is then better able to implement strategies which would include an acceleration of a deposit rate reduction or lag in a deposit rate increase 
the repricing strategies for loans would be inversely related 
the corporation s asset liability management policy guidelines limit interest rate risk exposure for the succeeding twelve month period 
simulations are prepared under the base case where interest rates remain flat  and most likely case where interest rates are defined using projections of economic factors 
additional simulations are produced estimating the impact on net interest income of a basis point movement upward or downward which cannot result in more than a decline in net interest income when compared to the base case 
the analysis at december   indicated that a basis point increase in interest rates would decrease net interest income by basis points below the base case scenario and a basis point decrease first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest sensitivity continued in interest rates would decrease net interest income by basis points below the base case scenario over the next twelve months  both within policy limits 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco is responsible for the identification  assessment and management of interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  capital adequacy and investment portfolio position 
the primary objective of the alco process is to ensure that the corporation s balance sheet structure maintains prudent levels of risk within the context of currently known and forecasted economic conditions and to establish strategies which provide the corporation with appropriate compensation for the assumption of those risks 
the alco attempts to mitigate interest rate risk through the use of strategies such as asset sales  asset and liability pricing and matched maturity funding 
the alco strategies are established by the corporation s senior management 
the corporation entered into an interest rate swap transaction during the third quarter of and two additional interest rate swap transactions during the second quarter of each of the swap transactions involved hedging adjustable libor based commercial loans with a receive fixed and pay floating interest rate swap of million notional amount  for a total of million 
the original maturities of the swap transactions ranged from to years 
the purpose of the swaps was to reduce the corporation s exposure to further declines in interest rates 
the alco continues to evaluate the use of additional derivative instruments to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets and liabilities 
another strategy aimed at reducing the corporation s exposure to falling interest rates was implemented during us government agency securities maturing in approximately years were purchased with short term borrowings 
final loan maturities and rate sensitivities of the loan portfolio excluding consumer installment and mortgage loans and before unearned income at december  were as follows dollar amounts in thousands within one year one to years after years total commercial and industrial financial institutions real estate construction real estate commercial other totals loans at fixed interest rates loans at variable interest rates totals first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit review maintaining a high quality loan portfolio is of great importance to the corporation 
the corporation manages the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio through the use of prudent lending policies and procedures and monitors risk through a periodic review process provided by internal auditors  regulatory authorities and our loan review staff 
these reviews include the analysis of credit quality  diversification of industry  compliance to policies and procedures and an analysis of current economic conditions 
in the management of its credit portfolio  the corporation emphasizes the importance of the collectibility of loans and leases as well as asset and earnings diversification 
the corporation immediately recognizes as a loss all credits judged to be uncollectible and has established an allowance for credit losses that may exist in the portfolio at a point in time  but have not been specifically identified 
the corporation s written lending policy requires certain underwriting standards to be met prior to funding any loan  including requirements for credit analysis  collateral value coverage and documentation 
the principal factor used to determine potential borrowers credit worthiness is business cash flows or consumer income available to service debt payments 
secondary sources of repayment  including collateral and guarantees  are frequently obtained 
the lending policy provides limits for individual and bank committee lending authorities 
in addition to the bank loan approval process  requests for borrowing relationships which will exceed one million dollars must also be approved by the corporation s credit committee 
this committee consists of a minimum of three members of the corporation s board of directors 
the corporation has an additional level of approval for credit relationships between thousand and million 
this procedure requires approval of those credits by a committee consisting of senior lenders of the corporation 
commercial and industrial loans are generally granted to small and middle market customers for working capital  operations  expansion or asset acquisition purposes 
operating cash flows of the business enterprise are identified as the principal source of repayment  with business assets held as collateral 
collateral margins and loan terms are based upon the purpose and structure of the transaction as set forth in loan policy 
commercial real estate loans are granted for the acquisition or improvement of real property 
generally  commercial real estate loans do not exceed of the appraised value of property pledged to secure the transaction 
repayment of such loans is expected from the operations of the subject real estate and is carefully analyzed prior to approval 
real estate construction loans are granted for the purposes of constructing improvements to real property  both commercial and residential 
on site inspections are conducted by qualified individuals prior to periodic permanent project financing  which is generally committed prior to the commencement of construction financing 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit review continued real estate loans secured by family residential housing properties are granted subject to statutory limits in effect for the bank regarding the maximum percentage of appraised value of the mortgaged property 
residential loan terms are normally established in compliance with secondary market requirements 
residential mortgage portfolio interest rate risk is controlled by secondary market sales  variable interest rate loans and balloon maturities 
loans to individuals represent financing extended to consumers for personal or household purposes  including automobile financing  education  home improvement and personal expenditures 
these loans are granted in the form of installment  credit card or revolving credit transactions 
consumer credit worthiness is evaluated on the basis of ability to repay  stability of income sources and past credit history 
the corporation maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level deemed sufficient to absorb losses which are inherent in the loan and lease portfolios at each balance sheet date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for credit losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the corporation s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include an assessment of individual problem loans  delinquency  loss experience  trends and other relevant factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant changes 
enhancements to the corporation s methodology during resulted in reallocation of the allowance for credit losses from unallocated to specific loan categories 
while the corporation consistently applies a comprehensive methodology and procedure  which is described in note statement of accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements  the allowance for credit loss methodologies incorporate management s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio as well as collection probabilities for problem credits 
although management considers the allowance for credit losses to be adequate based on information currently available  additional allowance for credit loss provisions may be necessary due to changes in management estimates and assumptions about asset impairment  information about borrowers that indicate changes in the expected future cash flows or changes in economic conditions 
the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses are significant elements of the corporation s financial statements  therefore management periodically reviews the processes and procedures utilized in determining the allowance for credit losses to identify potential enhancements to these processes including development of additional management information systems to ensure that all relevant factors are appropriately considered in the allowance analysis 
in addition  the corporation maintains a system of internal controls which are independently monitored and tested by internal audit and loan review staff to ensure that the loss estimation model is maintained in accordance with internal policies and procedures as well as generally accepted accounting principals 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit review continued since all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for credit losses is restricted to any individual credit or groups of credits  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all credit losses 
for analytical purposes  the following table sets forth an allocation of the allowance for credit losses at december according to the categories indicated 
management feels the unallocated portion of the reserve is necessary due to the uncertain economic and geo political environment and its impact on a variety of sectors such as health care and lodging 
the unallocated allowance was reduced during as a result of methodology enhancements 
allocation of the allowance for credit losses dollar amounts in thousands commercial  industrial  financial  agricultural and other real estate construction real estate commercial real estate residential loans to individuals lease financing receivables unallocated total allowance as percentage of average total loans the decrease in the allowance as a percent of average loans in reflects the trend of improvement in nonperforming loans  net charge offs and lower levels of the allowance being allocated to larger classified credits 
the spike in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of average total loans outstanding during the period was due to the impact of having the bankpittsburgh loans included in the average for only a short period during the year  or from the acquisition date of december  while the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of average total loans outstanding spiked during  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of actual loans outstanding remained at for and before declining to in other than those described below  there are no material credits that management has serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
the following table identifies nonperforming loans at december a loan is placed in a nonaccrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
past due loans are those loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection 
renegotiated loans are those loans which terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the borrower

nonperforming loan levels at december   increased million compared to levels due to increases in past due loans 
the increases in past due loans in were largely due to increases in residential loans secured by real estate 
increases in past due loans during were partially offset by decreases in nonaccrual loans which were largely due to decreases in residential loans secured by real estate 
nonperforming loan levels at december  decreased million compared to levels as decreases were noted in nonaccrual and past due loans 
the decrease in nonaccrual loans during was due to eight commercial loans that paid in full or were charged down and or charged off 
the decrease in past due loans for the period included decreases in all major categories with the most significant decreases in loans secured by residential real estate  loans secured by commercial real estate and other commercial loans 
this decrease in past due loans during was due to successful collection strategies 
interest income on nonaccrual loans decreased in the period compared to as the period included the final resolution of several large credits that included collection of some interest income 
the corporation s loan portfolio continues to be monitored by senior management to identify potential portfolio risks and detect potential credit deterioration in the early stages 
the corporation has a watch list committee which includes credit workout officers of the bank and reviews watch list credits for workout progress or deterioration 
loan loss adequacy and the status of significant nonperforming credits are monitored on a quarterly basis by a committee made up of senior first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit review continued officers of the bank and parent company 
these committees were established to provide additional internal monitoring and analysis in addition to that provided by the credit committees of the bank and parent company 
credit risk is mitigated during the loan origination process through the use of sound underwriting policies and collateral requirements and its previously described committee structure 
management also attempts to minimize loan losses by analyzing and modifying collection techniques on a periodic basis 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels 
capital resources equity capital stood at million at december   a million increase compared to december  the most significant change in equity resulted from the issuance of stock related to the gaf acquisition which increased equity by million  while the conversion of gaf s investment in fcfc stock into treasury shares resulted in a decrease of thousand to equity capital 
dividends declared reduced equity by million during as dividends were increased over levels  while net income increased equity by million for the same period 
additional advances by the corporation s employee stock ownership plan esop to fund the acquisition of the corporation s common stock for future distribution as employee compensation  net of long term debt payments and fair value adjustments to unearned esop shares  decreased equity by million 
the market value adjustment to securities available for sale decreased equity by million for the period 
amounts paid to fund the discount on reinvested dividends reduced equity by thousand 
proceeds from the issuance of treasury shares to provide for stock options exercised increased equity by million during  while the tax benefit related to the stock options increased equity by million 
equity capital was also impacted during by an increase of thousand from the reissuance of treasury shares to fund contingent payments related to the acquisition of first commonwealth financial advisors  which consummated in this contingent payment of the corporation s common stock was the second of four scheduled annual installments 
a capital base can be considered adequate when it enables the corporation to intermediate funds responsibly and provide related services while protecting against future uncertainties 
the evaluation of capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  earnings history and prospects  internal controls and management caliber 
in consideration of these factors  management s primary emphasis with respect to the corporation s capital position is to maintain an adequate and stable ratio of equity to assets 
see note regulatory restrictions and capital adequacy to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of regulatory capital guidelines and the corporation s capital ratios relative to these measurement standards 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk management in the normal course of business the corporation assumes various types of risk 
the corporation has identified twenty six standard risks which have been summarized into seven major risk categories 
the seven major risk categories include credit risk  market risk  liquidity risk  compliance legal risk  operational risk  reputation risk and strategic risk 
credit risk  market risk and liquidity risk are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
the remaining major risk categories are defined as follows compliance legal risk the risk arising from violations of  or noncompliance with laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices  or ethical standards  operational risk threat created by inadequate information systems  operational problems  weak internal control systems  fraud  or any other unforeseen catastrophes  reputation risk the risk to earnings or capital arising from negative public opinion  and strategic risk the risk arising from adverse business decisions or improper implementation of those decisions 
these factors and others could impact the corporation s business  financial condition and results of operation 
corporate management has taken strong and wide ranging actions to enhance the awareness of and proactively manage risk within the corporation 
in addition to establishing a comprehensive policy and procedure manual that is updated and regularly communicated throughout the corporation  the executive vice president  chief risk officer  oversees all aspects of the risk process 
our committee structure embraces a risk management culture  which begins with the risk committee that provides oversight and monitoring of key risk areas 
the risk committee  which is chaired by the executive vice president  chief risk officer  and has representation from all of the disciplines across the organization  meets to discuss and assess current and emerging risks as well as to identify solutions and mitigants 
credit quality and loan loss adequacy issues are addressed by the credit quality  watch list and loan loss reserve committees 
additional committees include security  which is responsible for coordinating the security program  privacy  which focuses on safeguarding client information  alco  which monitors interest rate and liquidity risks  and disclosure  which evaluates internal controls regarding information utilized in certain regulatory reports  as well as reviewing those reports and the disclosure process to ensure that disclosures are timely  complete and accurate 
the risk department has specific procedures to analyze and quantify risks in the seven major risk categories 
gaps between inherent risks and mitigants are quantified and presented to the risk committee for their review 
management continually reviews the mitigants and controls to ensure their continuity 
the internal audit department validates the existence and effectiveness of the controls 
risk gaps are compiled to develop a risk rating  which is incorporated into the balanced scorecard measure and is reported to the board of directors 
an analytical review of first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk management continued key indicators  both monetary and nonmonetary  as well as other current information that may become available through discussions with management serves as an early warning system to detect potential deteriorating internal controls 
all significant new initiatives and products are subject to a risk assessment prior to being presented for implementation 
an annual assessment of risk is also performed to identify potential threat areas to our computer systems 
our internal audit staff performs routine and consistent information technology reviews of identified risk areas  security measures and control processes 
with these processes in place the corporation believes that its objective of establishing a risk culture that identifies  measures  controls and monitors events or actions that may adversely affect our organization has been achieved 
our goal is not to eliminate risk but to understand fully the risk the corporation is assuming and appropriately manage those risks 
inflation and changing prices management is aware of the impact inflation has on interest rates and therefore  the impact it can have on a bank s performance 
the ability of a financial institution to cope with inflation can only be determined by analyzing and monitoring its asset and liability structure 
the corporation monitors its asset and liability position with particular emphasis on the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to reduce the effect of inflation upon its performance 
however  it must be remembered that the asset and liability structure of a financial institution is substantially different from an industrial corporation in that virtually all assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  meaning that they have been or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in general price levels 
examples of monetary items include cash  loans and deposits 
nonmonetary items are those assets and liabilities which do not gain or lose purchasing power solely as a result of general price level changes 
examples of nonmonetary items are premises and equipment 
inflation can have a more direct impact on categories of noninterest expenses such as salaries and wages  supplies and employee benefit costs 
these expenses are very closely monitored by management for both the effects of inflation and increases relating to such items as staffing levels  usage of supplies and occupancy costs
