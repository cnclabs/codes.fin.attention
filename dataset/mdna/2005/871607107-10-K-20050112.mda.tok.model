item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item and by the risk factors set forth below under the caption entitled factors that may affect future results 
synopsys is a world leader in eda software for semiconductor design 
we deliver technology leading semiconductor design and verification software platforms and ic manufacturing software products to the global electronics market  enabling the development and production of complex socs 
we also provide ip and design services to simplify the design process and accelerate time to market for our customers 
fiscal business environment we generate substantially all of our revenue from the semiconductor and electronics industries 
our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services out of their research and development r d budgets 
as a result  our business is heavily influenced by our customers business outlook and willingness to invest in new  and increasingly complex  chip designs 
beginning in late calendar  the semiconductor industry experienced its steepest and longest downturn of the past years 
semiconductor industry sales dropped approximately from late to early and then recovered slowly into throughout this period  our customers took many steps to reduce their expenses  including constraining r d expenditures  reducing the number of design engineers they employed  cutting back on their design starts  purchasing from fewer suppliers  and requiring more favorable pricing  payment and license terms from those suppliers  as well as pursuing consolidation within their own industry 
further  during this downturn  many semiconductor design companies failed or were acquired and the pace of investment in new companies declined 
the semiconductor industry association reported semiconductor industry growth of approximately in and estimates growth in of approximately 
historically  growth in semiconductor sales has been followed by growth in semiconductor r d spending  which in turn has led to growth in eda expenditures 
this relationship is not precise  however  and in the past there has been a lag of several quarters between an upturn in semiconductor industry sales and growth in eda spending 
at the beginning of fiscal  we based our forecast for the year in part on our expectations that the forecasted continued recovery in semiconductor revenue and improving conditions in the us economy would lead to significantly increased spending on eda products by our customers 
however  by the end of our third fiscal quarter  it became clear that eda spending growth was not tracking the upturn in the semiconductor industry 
we believe eda spending has not tracked the industry s recovery for a number of reasons 
first  in light of the severity of the downturn  we believe customers intense focus on expense reduction persists  and that they now generally approach spending more conservatively 
in addition  the semiconductor industry s recovery has been driven primarily by the consumer electronics market  where product price is a primary competitive factor  further increasing pressure on our customers to control costs  including by limiting their eda spending 
in addition to these broader trends  we believe our customers turned more cautious about their own business outlook in mid calendar due to a number of factors  including lack of visibility into their own future results  unexpected inventory buildup in the semiconductor supply chain and concerns about the industry s growth prospects in as a result  we believe our customers became more reluctant to extend or increase their existing commitments to us and to agree to upfront payment terms for multi year licenses 
these developments materially and adversely affected both our bookings and revenue for fiscal year in particular  lower than expected upfront license bookings adversely impacted our third quarter of fiscal results  since we recognize all revenue from upfront licenses in the quarter they are shipped 
lower than expected time based license bookings also adversely affected our results for the year and will adversely affect our future results  as a less than expected amount was added to our backlog to be recognized in future periods 
following the third quarter of fiscal  we re evaluated customer demand for upfront licenses  which require customers to pay at least of the license fee in the first year 
our customers increased preference for conserving cash by paying for licenses over time has made upfront payment terms a significantly more difficult negotiating issue 
accordingly  effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we shifted our target license mix to consist almost entirely of time based licenses 
for the fourth quarter of fiscal year  upfront licenses constituted approximately of license orders  compared to an average of approximately since our original introduction of time based licenses in august this shift negatively impacted revenue  earnings and cash flow from operations for the quarter as many orders which previously would have generated revenue  and in many cases cash  upfront instead were booked as tbls  contributing primarily to backlog for future quarters 
our results in the third quarter and the license mix shift in the fourth quarter resulted in lower revenue  earnings and cash flow from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  due to our further license mix transition we expect revenue  earnings and cash flow from operations for the first three quarters of fiscal under the new model to be below the comparable quarters under the old  higher upfront model in fiscal however  we believe making this transition meets our customers needs while enabling us to better preserve the value of our technology and enhance the predictability of our business 
we continue to believe that  over the long term  any growth in eda spending will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor r d spending and on continued growth in the overall semiconductor market 
the semiconductor industry association has forecasted semiconductor revenues to be flat in and to grow modestly in accordingly  and with our continuing license model shift and our expectation of a relatively low level of major customer license renewals in fiscal based on scheduled renewal dates  we expect our revenue  earnings and cash flow from operations for fiscal to be below fiscal synopsys is under no obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter any of the information contained in this overview  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
fiscal product developments during fiscal  we announced or introduced a number of enhancements to our products  including delivery of our galaxy platform  a major enhancement to our original galaxy design platform  offering substantial improvements in speed  capacity  quality of results and process technology support  and representing two years of work integrating products acquired in our acquisition of avant corporation with synopsys core products 
release of our discovery ams solution  a subset of our verification technologies optimized for verification of analog and mixed signal designs 
enhancements to our primetime timing analysis product  increasing speed and capacity by up to three times compared to the prior version 
delivery of our galaxy power solution  offering designers the ability to improve the power efficiency of their ics 
enhancements to our hspice circuit simulator  providing up to times better performance and supporting high frequency and rf ic designs 
improvements to our proteus opc product  providing near linear scalability when using industry leading processors 
availability of designware pci express physical layer ip core  enabling lower cost ip 
fiscal financial performance summary orders were million versus  million in fiscal  reflecting the trends and developments discussed above in fiscal business environment and the timing of a major contract renewal which was expected to be completed in fiscal  but was not completed until the first quarter of fiscal our book to bill ratio in fiscal and fiscal was approximately and  respectively 
revenue was  million  down from fiscal  due primarily to a lower level of orders than expected in the first three quarters of fiscal  the shift in license mix during the fourth quarter to an almost completely ratable model and a decrease in maintenance revenue 
time based revenue increased from fiscal to million  primarily reflecting recognition of revenue on increased time based orders in fiscal upfront license revenue declined from million to million  due primarily to a lower than expected level of upfront license orders in the third quarter and to the license model shift effective in the fourth quarter 
for the year  we derived approximately of our software revenue from upfront licenses and from time based licenses  versus approximately and  respectively  during fiscal the percentage of software revenue from upfront licenses was in the first half of the fiscal year and in the second half of the fiscal year  reflecting lower than expected upfront license bookings in the third quarter and the shift from upfront licenses to time based licenses in the fourth quarter  each of which translated into a reduction in the revenue from upfront license orders 
reflecting this shift  during the fourth quarter  approximately of our revenue was derived from backlog attributable to prior period time based license bookings 
maintenance revenue declined by from million in fiscal to million  primarily reflecting the lower than expected level of upfront license orders  which led to a lower level of new maintenance orders  the shift of some upfront licenses to tsls under which maintenance is included with the license fee and therefore is not reported separately  and non renewal of maintenance by certain customers compared to fiscal professional service and other revenue  at million  increased slightly from million for fiscal  primarily as a result of customers continued use of outside consultants to augment their internal staff and to assist in implementing their advanced ic designs 
net income was million compared to million in the fiscal  primarily due to lower revenue and other income  an increase in cost of services revenues due to increased field support headcount and higher amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions 
cash provided by operations for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  driven primarily by lower orders and reported revenues compared to fiscal  cash disbursements for foreign income taxes  higher general and administrative expenses and workforce realignment expenses 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock in fiscal for approximately million 
in december  after the end of the fiscal year  our board renewed the stock buyback program  restoring the authorization to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
fiscal acquisitions in fiscal  we acquired i accelerant networks  inc accelerant to enhance our standards based ip solutions  ii cascade semiconductors  inc cascade  to augment our ip portfolio of pci express products  and iii the technology assets of analog design automation  inc ada to expand our analog and mixed signal offerings 
in addition  in fiscal we completed one additional acquisition and two additional asset acquisition transactions we do not consider material for financial statement purposes 
after the fiscal year end  we completed the acquisition of ise integrated systems engineering ag ise  broadening our tcad product line and announced the proposed acquisition of nassda corporation  which would settle our outstanding litigation and enhance our circuit simulation offerings 
critical accounting policies we base the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which we prepare in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations  are revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition 
we have designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
with respect to software sales  during fiscal  we utilized three license types technology subscription licenses tsls are for a finite term  on average approximately three years  and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive  or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
maintenance is bundled for the term of the license and not purchased separately 
term licenses are also for a finite term  usually three years  but do not provide the customer any rights to receive  or to exchange licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term 
the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee 
perpetual licenses  which continue as long as the customer renews maintenance  plus an additional years 
perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive  or to exchange licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually 
the annual maintenance fee for purchases under million is typically calculated as a percentage of the list price of the licensed software 
for purchases over million  the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee 
we sometimes refer to tsls and term licenses  either individually or collectively  as renewable licenses because the customer must purchase an extension or a new license in order to continue using the software after the specified term of the contract expires 
in a renewal transaction  we may either replace the pre existing arrangement with an entirely new arrangement or maintain two agreements 
where we replace the existing agreement  we often supersede the original arrangement and thereafter deliver software and recognize revenue based upon the type of license reflected in the new agreement 
where we maintain two agreements  we recognize revenue on the new incremental agreement based upon the new license type purchased 
if we grant extended payment terms as discussed below  we recognize license revenue as payments become due and payable 
customers occasionally convert their existing tsls to perpetual licenses  paying an incremental fee which we recognize upon contract signing in accordance with aicpa technical practice aid tpa  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in some situations  the contract converting the tsl to a perpetual license is modified to such an extent that a new arrangement exists 
the changes to the contract may include increases or decreases in the total technology under license  changes in payment terms  changes in license terms and other pertinent factors 
in these situations  we account for all of the arrangement fee as a new sale and recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we report revenue in three categories upfront license  time based license and service 
upfront license revenue includes perpetual licenses 
we recognize the perpetual license fee in full if  upon shipment of the software  payment terms require the customer to pay at least of the perpetual license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
for perpetual licenses in which less than of the license fee is payable within one year from shipment  we recognize the revenue as customer installments become due and payable 
upfront term licenses 
we recognize term license fees in full if  upon shipment of the software  payment terms require the customer to pay at least of the term license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
time based license tbl revenue includes technology subscription licenses 
we typically recognize revenue from tsl license fees which include bundled maintenance ratably over the term of the license period 
however  where we offer extended payment terms ie  where less than of the tsl license fees are due within one year from shipment  we recognize revenue from tsls in an amount equal to the lesser of the ratable portion of the entire fee or customer installments as they become due and payable 
term licenses with extended payment terms 
for term licenses where less than of the term license fee is due within one year from shipment  we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable 
service revenue includes maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses 
we generally recognize revenue from maintenance associated with perpetual and term licenses ratably over the maintenance term 
professional service fees 
we generally recognize revenue from consulting and training services as services are performed and accepted 
we allocate revenue on software transactions referred to as arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the respective fair values of the elements 
our determination of fair value of each element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to consulting 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and recognize consulting revenues as the related services are performed 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products  we must evaluate whether i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we apply these criteria as discussed below 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
our customary practice is to have a written contract  signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement with us prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software to our customers physically or electronically 
for physical deliveries  our standard transfer terms are typically fob shipping point 
for electronic deliveries  delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes or keys that allow the customer to take immediate possession of software 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard payment terms require or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year 
where these terms apply  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and we recognize revenue upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the payment terms do not meet this standard  which we refer to as extended payment terms  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable 
in the case of a tsl  we recognize revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed or determinable  due to application of other revenue accounting guidelines relating to maintenance services and arrangements that include rights to unspecified future technology 
collectibility is probable 
to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees  which we do on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for a new customer  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review 
we increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer 
if we determine at any time that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue on a cash collected basis 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 
we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  contract rights intangibles  customer installed base relationships  trademarks and tradenames  covenants not to compete  customer backlog  and other intangibles 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal as of october   the carrying amount of our intangible assets  net was million 
we evaluate aggregate goodwill on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired  we assess the impairment of the goodwill using the two step method prescribed by sfas any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges on our goodwill during fiscal as of october   the carrying amount of our goodwill was million 
income taxes 
the relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly affect our effective tax rate 
we are also subject to changing tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate 
as of october   current deferred tax assets  net of current deferred tax liabilities totaled million 
non current deferred tax assets  net of non current deferred tax liabilities  totaled million 
we believe it is more likely than not that our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for any valuation allowance  and if we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would charge to income an adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the period we make that determination 
we provide for united states income taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside of the united states 
as of october   the cumulative amount of earnings upon which united states income taxes have not been provided was approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable on an account by account basis and establish a specific reserve for any particular receivable when we determine collectibility is not probable 
in addition  we provide a general reserve on all accounts receivable  which we calculate as a percentage  determined within a specified range of percentages of the outstanding balance in each aged group 
in determining this percentage  we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debt expense  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international exposures such as currency devaluation  and changes in our customer payment terms to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  impairing their ability to make payments  we may need to establish additional allowances 
as of october   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
results of operations revenue background we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses  maintenance and professional services 
as a result of the application of accounting rules and policies relating to revenue recognition  orders we receive for software licenses and services turn into revenue on our income statements at varying rates 
in general  orders for software licenses turn to revenue either at the time the license is shipped an upfront license  or ratably over the term of the license a time based license 
maintenance orders generally turn to revenue ratably over the maintenance period and professional service orders generally turn to revenue upon completion of contractually agreed upon milestones 
a more complete description of our revenue recognition policies can be found above under critical accounting policies 
our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our upfront license revenue  time based license revenue  maintenance revenue and professional service revenue 
upfront license revenue generally depends on the volume of upfront license orders shipped during the quarter 
time based license revenue in any quarter is derived almost entirely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters  since our tsl orders generally yield revenue ratably over a typical term of three years  a given tsl order contributes to revenue in the quarter it is booked at most one twelfth of its aggregate booking value 
maintenance revenue in any quarter is similarly derived largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a typical term of one year 
finally  professional service revenue is also derived almost entirely from orders received in prior quarters  since we recognize revenue from professional services when those services are rendered  not when they are booked 
any order or portion thereof that does not turn to revenue in the quarter in which it is received is added to our backlog and generally recognized in future periods 
the components of our aggregate backlog are discussed further under part i  item business sales  distribution and backlog above 
given the different revenue impacts of upfront licenses and tsls  in any given fiscal quarter  our license revenue is very sensitive to the mix of upfront and time based licenses delivered during the quarter 
a tsl order results in significantly lower current period revenue than an equal sized order for an upfront license 
conversely  a tsl order will result in higher revenue recognized in future periods than an equal sized order for an upfront license 
for example  on a  order for an upfront license  we recognize  of revenue in the quarter the product is shipped and no revenue in future quarters 
on a  order for a three year tsl shipped on the last day of the quarter  we recognize no revenue in the quarter the product is shipped and  in each of the twelve succeeding quarters 
tsls also shift maintenance revenue to time based revenue since maintenance is included in tsls 
license order mix beginning in august  when we adopted tsls  we maintained a target license mix of approximately tsls and upfront licenses  based on our expectations of total orders and our assessment of the demand for upfront licenses  which have more front loaded payment terms than tsls 
from august through the fourth quarter of fiscal  our average license mix has been time based licenses and upfront licenses  although the license mix has varied considerably from quarter to quarter 
our license order mix for the last nine fiscal quarters is set forth below q q q q q q q q q upfront licenses time based license the percentage of upfront licenses is driven by a number of factors  including the level of overall license orders  customer demand  preferred customer payment terms and requested customer ship dates 
the percentages in the third quarter of fiscal reflect both lower than expected upfront orders and a substantially lower than expected overall orders total 
as described above under fiscal business environment  for the fourth quarter of fiscal and beyond  we have adjusted our target license mix from approximately time based licenses to an almost completely time based license mix 
the figures above for the fourth quarter of fiscal reflect this shift in our target license mix 
our upfront and time based license agreements sometimes provide the right to exchange a portion of the software initially subject to the license for other specified synopsys products 
the customer s exchange of product  when so provided in the license agreement  does not alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid by the customer 
however  because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products  the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately 
orders total orders in fiscal were million  a decrease from  million in fiscal the decrease in orders reflects the trends and developments discussed above in fiscal business environment and the timing of a major contract renewal  which was expected to occur during fiscal  but which was not completed until the first quarter of fiscal reported revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions the decrease in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to i a lower level of orders than expected in fiscal  ii our shift in the fourth quarter to an almost completely ratable license model  and iii a decrease in maintenance revenue 
the increase in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i contribution of products from the avant acquisition  which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal  for all of fiscal  ii continued phase in of the ratable license model  and iii license renewals with many of our largest japanese customers in the second quarter of fiscal  a relatively high proportion of which were perpetual licenses yielding upfront revenue 
with our further shift in license mix beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expect total reported revenue for the first three quarters and full fiscal year under the new more ratable model to be below the comparable periods in fiscal time based revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue since we adopted a license mix of approximately upfront and tbls in august  our time based revenue has grown in successive periods in both dollar and percentage terms as tbl orders received each fiscal period contribute revenue that is layered over the revenue recognized from tbl orders received in prior periods 
this effect repeats itself each period in varying degrees until the tbl model is fully phased in 
the increase in time based revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to this continued phase in of our ratable license model and to the full year revenue contribution in fiscal from a strong level of time based license orders received during fiscal the increase in time based license revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was similarly due primarily to the continued phase in of the ratable license model and to the increased time based license sales contributed by avant products during the full fiscal year with our shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal to an almost completely ratable license model  we expect an additional phase in period during which our time based revenue should continue to increase in both dollar and percentage terms even if the overall level of tbl orders does not grow  and could grow even if the overall level of tbl orders in any period declines 
over the long term  as we complete this further transition  time based revenue should more closely track average time based orders trends 
upfront revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the decrease in upfront revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the shift to a higher ratable license model in the fourth quarter of fiscal and to lower than expected upfront orders in the third quarter of fiscal upfront license revenue for fiscal increased compared to fiscal primarily due to the contribution of avant products for the full fiscal year and license renewals with many of our largest japanese customers in the second quarter of fiscal  a relatively high proportion of which were perpetual licenses yielding upfront revenue 
the percentage of revenue comprised of upfront licenses declined over the three year period due to the phasing in of our ratable license model begun in august with our further shift in license mix in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expect upfront revenue to significantly decrease in fiscal in both dollar and percentage terms 
service revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions maintenance revenue professional service and other revenue total service revenue percentage of total revenue our maintenance fees have declined primarily due to our adoption of tsls  which include maintenance with the license fee and thus contribute no separately recognized maintenance fees 
other factors include the pricing of maintenance on perpetual license transactions above million  which is substantially lower than the rates on standard perpetual licenses  and non renewal of maintenance by certain customers 
with our license model shift  we expect more of our maintenance revenue to be included in our overall tsl revenue  and therefore for our separately recognized maintenance revenue to continue to decline 
professional service fees grew approximately from fiscal to fiscal as customers continued to use our professional services personnel to augment their internal staff and to assist in implementing their advanced ic designs 
professional service revenue decreased significantly from fiscal to fiscal  reflecting reduced demand for turnkey chip design services 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  consulting capacity constraints and pricing pressure from customers and competitors constrained our professional service revenue growth 
we expect these factors to continue to impact professional service revenue in fiscal service revenue  as a percentage of total revenue  has posted steady decreases over the past three years due primarily to the inclusion of maintenance services in tsls described above 
orders and revenue seasonality 
historically  our orders and revenue have been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter  with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one fiscal year and the first quarter of the next fiscal year  although the timing of major license renewals can alter this typical trend 
in our license model  revenue seasonality has historically resulted principally from the decline in the amount of upfront orders from the fourth quarter of one fiscal year to the first quarter of the next fiscal year 
going forward  however  we expect our shift to an almost completely ratable license model will significantly reduce revenue seasonality 
revenue product groups 
for management reporting purposes  we organize our products and services into five distinct groups galaxy design platform  discovery verification platform  intellectual property ip  design for manufacturing and professional services other 
the products and services in these groups are described in detail under part i  item business  above 
the following table summarizes the revenue attributable to these groups as a percentage of total revenue for the last eight quarters 
we include revenue from companies or products we have acquired during the periods covered from the acquisition date through the end of the relevant periods 
for presentation purposes  we allocate software maintenance revenue  which represented approximately and of our total revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  to the products to which those support services related 
further  with the adoption of our platform strategy in fiscal  we redefined our product groups and have reclassified prior period revenues in accordance with this grouping to provide a consistent presentation 
q q q q q q q q galaxy design platform discovery verification platform ip design for manufacturing professional services other total the respective revenue contributions from our different groups has been relatively stable over the eight quarter period shown in the table above 
this stability is principally due to the fact that most of our customers purchase multiple products from us  and do so under tsls  for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license 
accordingly  significant changes in revenue contribution from different groups have been driven primarily by one time events  such as acquisitions  or by the mix of upfront versus time based orders received for certain products during a given quarter 
for example  our galaxy design platform revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in the second quarter of fiscal due to a number of large perpetual licenses with our japanese customers  many of which included a disproportionate amount of products from the galaxy design platform  yielding significant upfront revenue contributions from that product group for that quarter 
similarly  the percentage of revenue from our ip products rose significantly in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of increased sales of upfront ip licenses during that quarter 
while we expect our tsl licensing model will continue to lessen quarter to quarter variations in revenue in the near term  we believe our ip and design for manufacturing products will  over time  account for increasing percentages of total revenue as a result of our customers greater acceptance of and reliance upon pre designed  pre verified ip components and tools and technologies needed for the manufacture of very small geometry ics 
events affecting cost of revenues and operating expenses temporary shutdown of operations 
as a cost saving measure  we temporarily shut down operations in north america for three days during the first quarter of fiscal  four days during the third quarter of fiscal and four days during the third quarter of fiscal  resulting in savings of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal operations were not shut down for any days in fiscal the savings in fiscal and relate primarily to salaries and benefits and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows year ended october  in thousands cost of revenue  research and development   sales and marketing   general and administrative total savings   workforce reduction 
during the fourth quarter of  the first quarter of fiscal and the second quarter of fiscal we reduced expenses by decreasing the number of employees in most departments in domestic and foreign locations 
this workforce reduction affected approximately employees in fiscal employees in the us and employees outside the us  employees in fiscal employees in the us and employees outside the us and employees in fiscal employees in the us and employees outside the us  resulting in charges of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the charges in each fiscal year relate primarily to severance and other special termination benefits and are included in our consolidated financial statements as follows year ended october  in thousands cost of revenue  research and development    sales and marketing    general and administrative  total charge    workforce realignment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and effective in the first quarter of fiscal  we realigned our operations to focus resources on more strategic areas of investment and to become more operationally efficient 
this realignment affected a total of employees in the united states and employees outside the united states  in most departments 
charges for severance and other termination benefits totaling million were reflected in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal as follows 
year ended october  in thousands cost of revenue  research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  total charge  cost of revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue cost of revenue includes personnel and related costs to provide product support  consulting services and training 
cost of revenue also includes software production costs  product packaging  documentation  amortization of capitalized software development costs  and amortization of core developed technology and other intangible assets as described below 
management allocates these expenses  most of which are relatively fixed and do not fluctuate significantly with changes in revenue or license mix  to cost of upfront licenses  cost of time based licenses and cost of services  based on the mix of orders booked within a given period 
the increase in cost of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i an increase in amortization of million of core developed technology recorded as a result of our acquisitions completed in fiscal and  ii an increase of million in field support personnel costs due to targeted hiring in the customer support function  and iii increased human resources  technology and facilities costs of million as a result of the increase in cost of revenue headcount as a percentage of total headcount 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of i million in consulting services  ii million as discussed above under workforce realignment  and iii million in royalty expense in fiscal compared to fiscal total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased due to lower revenue during and increased amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation from acquisitions in fiscal the increase in cost of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i an increase of million in amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation recorded as a result of our acquisitions in fiscal and  ii the cost of our realignment of operations totaling million as discussed above under workforce realignment  and iii additional royalties for in licensed technology of million 
we expect cost of revenue  excluding amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation allocated to this line item  to increase slightly in fiscal as a result of increased headcount from acquisitions during fiscal and higher targeted incentive compensation 
we also expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in fiscal to increase and gross margin to decrease due to the expected increase in cost of revenue described above and the expected decrease in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal see amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation below for information regarding the amount of amortization charged to cost of revenue for the relevant periods 
operating expenses functional allocation of operating expenses historically  we allocate certain human resource programs  information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within the functional area 
annually  or upon a significant change in headcount as in the case of a workforce reduction or realignment and other factors  management reviews the allocation methodology and the expenses included in the allocation pool 
management conducted such a review with respect to synopsys workforce reductions in fiscal and and the workforce realignment in fiscal and with respect to additional expenses from certain worldwide it and facility programs implemented during fiscal the resulting expense allocations generally contribute significantly to the fluctuations in functional area expenses from year to year 
research and development year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the slight decrease in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects an increase of million in research and development personnel and related costs as a result of increased investment in research and development activities  offset by i decreased depreciation of million as a result of overall decreased capital spending and lower replacement costs compared to fiscal  ii severance packages totaling million associated with our workforce reduction during fiscal which were not incurred during fiscal  iii a decrease of million in consulting services compared to fiscal  and iv a reduction of million in north america human resources  information technology and facilities costs allocated to research and development expenses as a result of the decrease in research and development headcount as a percentage of total headcount 
the increase in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increases of i million in research and development personnel and related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal and  including additional employer payroll taxes incurred as a result of stock option exercises during fiscal  ii million in increased human resources  information technology and facilities costs allocated to research and development as a result of the increase in research and development headcount as a percentage of total headcount  and iii million as a result of our realignment of operations as discussed above under workforce realignment 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of million as a result of capital expenditure control measures implemented in fiscal and million in consulting services incurred in fiscal that were not incurred in fiscal we expect research and development expense to increase slightly in fiscal as a result of increased headcount from acquisitions during fiscal and higher targeted incentive compensation 
we also expect research and development expense as a percentage of revenue to increase due to the expected increase in research and development expense described above and the expected decrease in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal sales and marketing year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i a reduction of million in variable compensation  driven by reduced orders and shipments in fiscal  ii a reduction of million in sales and marketing personnel and related costs as a result of decreased headcount due to previous workforce reductions and realignments  and iii million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of our realignment of operations as discussed above under workforce realignment 
this decrease is partially offset by increases of i million in human resources  information technology and facilities costs allocated to sales and marketing expenses as a result of the increase in sales and marketing headcount as a percentage of total headcount and ii million related to expanded marketing efforts and charges associated with the cancellation of certain employee related functions 
the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i million in additional sales and marketing personnel and related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal and  including additional employer payroll taxes incurred as a result of stock option exercises during fiscal  offset by savings from a four day shutdown of operations in north america  ii million as a result of realignment charges as discussed above under workforce realignment  and iii million in additional travel expenses related to sales efforts 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in human resources  technology and facilities costs allocated to sales and marketing expenses as a result of a decrease in sales and marketing headcount as a percentage of total headcount 
we expect sales and marketing expense to increase slightly in fiscal as a result of increased headcount from acquisitions during fiscal and higher targeted incentive compensation 
we also expect sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue to increase due to the expected increase in research and development expense and the expected decrease in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i the million termination fee paid to monolithic system technology  inc mosys in connection with termination of the acquisition agreement in april and professional service fees of million relating to that transaction and the subsequent litigation  ii an increase of million in professional service fees relating to other litigation matters  iii million in facilities costs primarily related to planned facilities consolidation in fiscal  iv a loss of million related to the sublease of a portion of our ireland headquarter facility  and v a million increase in depreciation due to increased capital spending in information technology 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in human resources  information technology and facilities costs reported under this line item as a result of a decrease in general and administrative headcount as a percentage of total headcount 
the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to i million in additional general and administrative personnel and related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal and  including additional employer taxes incurred as a result of stock option exercises during fiscal  ii million increase in depreciation as a result of upgrades to our information technology infrastructure  iii an increase of million in facilities costs allocated to general and administrative expense due to new leases during the current year and the expiration of a sublease on one of synopsys buildings in june  iv an increase of million in professional services costs  patent prosecution expenditures and litigation  v an increase of million in maintenance agreements covering software and computing equipment obtained in acquisitions during fiscal and  and vi million related to the realignment of operations as discussed above under workforce realignment 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of i million in human resources  technology and facilities costs allocated to general and administrative expenses as a result of a decrease in general and administrative headcount as a percentage of total headcount  and ii a reduction of million in bad debt expense as accounts receivable aging improved from fiscal we expect general and administrative expense to be flat or decrease slightly in fiscal as a result of continuing cost controls and the absence of certain one time charges such as those associated with the mosys transaction  partially offset by higher targeted incentive compensation 
however  we expect general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue to increase due to the expected decrease in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal integration costs 
non recurring integration costs incurred relate to merger activities which are not included in the purchase consideration under emerging issues task force number eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
during fiscal  integration costs were million and consisted primarily of i million related to the premium for the insurance policy expensed in conjunction with the avant merger  ii million related to write downs of synopsys facilities and property under the management approved facility exit plan for the avant merger  iii million related to severance costs for synopsys employees who were terminated and costs associated with transition employees as a result of the fiscal mergers  iv million related to the write off of software licenses owned by synopsys which were originally purchased from avant  v million goodwill impairment charge related to a prior synopsys acquisition as a result of the acquisition of avant  and vi million of other expenses including travel and certain professional fees related to the fiscal mergers 
in process research and development in fiscal purchased in process research and development iprd was million and represents in process technologies associated with a fourth quarter acquisition considered immaterial for financial statement purposes 
purchased iprd of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  represents in process technologies associated with our acquisitions of numerical in fiscal and avant and insilicon in fiscal at the date of each acquisition  the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 
valuation of iprd 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology is determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition date 
the value of in process technology is then segmented into two classifications i developed technology completed and ii in process technology to be completed  giving explicit consideration to the value created by the research and development efforts of the acquired business prior to the date of acquisition and to be created by synopsys after the acquisition 
these value creation efforts were estimated by considering the following major factors i time based data  ii cost based data and iii complexity based data 
the value of the in process technology was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach  focusing on the income producing capabilities of the in process technologies 
under this approach  the value is determined by estimating the revenue contribution generated by each of the identified products within the classification segments 
revenue estimates were based on i individual product revenues  ii anticipated growth rates  iii anticipated product development and introduction schedules  iv product sales cycles  and v the estimated life of a product s underlying technology 
from the revenue estimates  operating expense estimates  including costs of sales  general and administrative  sales and marketing  income taxes and a use charge for contributory assets  were deducted to arrive at operating income 
revenue growth rates were estimated by management for each product and gave consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
operating expense estimates reflect synopsys historical expense ratios 
additionally  these projects will require continued research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
the resulting operating income stream was discounted to reflect its present value at the date of acquisition 
the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased in process technology is our weighted average cost of capital wacc  taking into account our required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  if any  and the uncertainty of technological advances  all of which are unknown at this time 
numerical 
on march   we acquired numerical  which specialized in subwavelength lithography enabling solutions 
the iprd expense related to the numerical acquisition was million 
numerical had five iprd projects phase shift masking psm  subwavelength software  equipment software  cadabra and computer aided transcription system cats representing    and  respectively  of the total iprd value 
these projects were expected to be completed shortly following the completion of the merger 
psm  subwavelength software and cats software were completed in fiscal our cadabra product was released in the first quarter of fiscal the equipment software project consists of in process technology for multiple products 
these products were either completed in fiscal  discontinued  or were integrated with other synopsys products during fiscal expenditures to complete numerical s acquired in process technologies approximated the original estimates 
insilicon 
on september   we acquired insilicon  a leading provider of connectivity semiconductor ip used by semiconductor and systems companies to design socs that are critical components of innovative wired and wireless products 
the iprd expense related to the insilicon acquisition was million 
insilicon had three iprd projects dela  peripheral component interconnect pci express and universal serial business physical usb phy accounting for  and of the total iprd value  respectively 
these projects were  and complete at the time of acquisition  respectively 
during fiscal  synopsys decided to discontinue the dela project 
pci express and usb phy have been completed 
expenditures to complete insilicon s acquired in process technologies approximated the original estimates 
avant 
on june   we acquired avant  a leading developer of software used in the physical design and physical verification stages of ic design 
the iprd expense related to the avant merger was million 
the principal in process technologies were identified based on the following product families percent complete as of date of acquisition product family value short term long term in thousands physical products division ppd  verification products division vpd  analysis products division apd  logical products division lpd  not applicable technology computer aided design tcad  analogy  these projects were completed during fiscal and expenditures to complete the acquired in process technologies approximated the original estimates 
the risks associated with acquired research and development are considered high and no assurance can be made that these products will generate any benefit to us or meet market expectations 
amortization of goodwill  intangible assets and deferred stock compensation 
amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation includes the amortization of the contract rights intangible associated with certain executory contracts  core developed technology  trademarks  trade names  customer relationships  covenants not to compete and other intangibles acquired in business combinations completed during fiscal  and intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from three to ten years 
deferred stock compensation represents the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed in connection with prior year acquisitions 
the deferred stock compensation is amortized over the options remaining vesting period of one to three years 
generally  amortization of deferred stock compensation will decrease over time as the assumed stock options vest  although employee terminations affect the exact timing and amount of future amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization expense for these assets is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions included in cost of revenue included in operating expenses total percentage of total revenue the increase in amortization of intangible assets and deferred compensation in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to additional amortization of assets acquired in the numerical acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal partially offset by the declining amounts of amortization related to deferred compensation recorded in prior year acquisitions 
see note to notes to audited consolidated financial statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts 
the increase in amortization of intangible assets and deferred compensation in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to fiscal and acquisitions  particularly avant  partially offset by a million decrease in goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of sfas on november  under which goodwill is no longer amortized 
impairment of intangible assets 
there were no material impairment charges related to intangible assets during fiscal and in fiscal  we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of million to reduce the amount of certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions to their estimated fair value 
approximately million and million are included in integration expense and amortization of intangible assets  respectively  on the consolidated statement of operations 
the impairment charge is primarily attributable to the route compiler technology acquired from  and goodwill related to  the acquisition of stanza  inc stanza in during fiscal  we determined that we would not allocate future resources to assist in the market growth of this technology as products acquired in the merger with avant provided customers with superior capabilities 
as a result  we do not anticipate any future sales of the stanza product 
expensing of stock awards 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which will be effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal sfas r will result in our recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
synopsys currently uses the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to its employees 
under this standard  we generally do not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants we issue under our stock option plans or related to the discounts we provide under our employee stock purchase plans 
under the new rules  we are required to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards  this will lead to substantial additional compensation expense and therefore will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards during fiscal years  and operating margin our operating margin declined from approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal  primarily due to the decrease in revenue year over year 
as a result of the expected decrease in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal and the expected increase in overall operating expenses described above  we expect our operating margin in fiscal to be meaningfully lower than in fiscal other income expense  net year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions interest income  net gain loss on sale of investments  net of investment write downs other total the decrease in other income expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to reduced investment gains and reduced rental income 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to the million expense in related to the settlement of the cadence design systems  inc cadence litigation 
liquidity and capital resources our source of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments over the last three years has been from funds generated from our business  including cash on hand from companies we have acquired 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million  or  to million as of october  from million as of october  cash provided by operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in cash from operations was driven in part by lower orders and reported revenues in fiscal  as well as by increased use of operating cash as follows i cash disbursements for foreign income taxes of approximately million  ii payment of million for the mosys acquisition agreement termination fee and associated litigation costs  iii disbursements associated with our fiscal workforce realignment of approximately million  iv payments of international value added taxes of approximately million  and v increased prepaid maintenance contract expenses for our design and information systems electronic infrastructure 
these uses of cash were partially offset by income tax refunds of million 
accounts receivable  net of allowances  decreased million  or  to million as of october  from million as of october  days sales outstanding dso  calculated based on revenue for the most recent quarter and accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date  decreased to days as of october  from days as of october  the decrease in accounts receivable and dso was attributable to a million reduction in new billings caused by lower orders during fiscal and longer customer payment terms compared to fiscal  partially offset by a million decrease in collections compared to the prior fiscal year 
cash provided by operations is in part dependent upon the payment terms on our license agreements 
for an upfront license  we require that at least of the license fee be paid within the first year 
conversely  payment terms for time based licenses are generally extended  typically the license fee is paid quarterly in even increments over the term of the license 
accordingly  we generally receive cash from upfront licenses sooner than on time based licenses 
our lower than expected level of up front orders in the third quarter of fiscal and further transition to an almost completely ratable license model beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal reduced our cash flow from operations for fiscal  we expect this further transition to continue to adversely affect cash flow from operations during fiscal cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease of million is primarily due to a substantial decrease of cash used for acquisitions and decreased proceeds from the sale of long term investments 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the decrease of million is primarily due to a decrease in proceeds of million from the sale of shares pursuant to our employee stock option plans and stock purchase plans during fiscal and increased purchases of treasury stock of million 
we hold our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in the united states and in foreign accounts  primarily in ireland  bermuda  and japan 
as of october   we held an aggregate of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in the united states and an aggregate of million in foreign accounts 
funds in foreign accounts are generated from revenue outside north america 
with the exception of japan  we currently maintain a policy under apb  accounting for income taxes special areas  of permanently reinvesting such funds outside of the united states 
in april  we entered into a three year  million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
this facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash  as well as other non financial covenants 
the facility terminates on april  borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  however  we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at eurodollar rates plus a spread between and based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant 
in addition  commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between and per annum based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant 
in april  we borrowed and repaid million under the credit facility 
as of october   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and we were in compliance with all covenants 
in november  synopsys completed its acquisition of ise for cash consideration of million 
on november   synopsys signed a merger agreement to acquire nassda corporation in an all cash transaction for a purchase price of per share 
the aggregate consideration is approximately million 
at september   nassda reported cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
the transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions 
in addition  the approval of nassda s stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of nassda common stock and approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of nassda common stock casting votes affirmatively or negatively on the merger agreement excluding nassda s officers and directors  the individual defendants and the related parties of the individual defendants is required for nassda and synopsys to complete the proposed merger 
certain directors  officers and employees of nassda who own in the aggregate approximately of nassda s outstanding common shares have agreed to vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement 
upon the closing of the acquisition  the nassda officers  directors and employees who are defendants in the litigation between synopsys and nassda will make settlement payments to synopsys in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next twelve months

stock option plans under our stock option plan the plan   shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance 
pursuant to the plan  the board of directors the board may grant either incentive or non qualified stock options to purchase shares of common stock to employees and consultants  excluding non employee directors at not less than of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date 
stock options granted under the plan generally vest over a period of four years and expire ten years from the date of grant 
as of october    stock options remain outstanding and  shares of common stock are reserved for future grants under this plan 
under our non statutory stock option plan the plan   shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance 
pursuant to the plan  the board may grant non qualified stock options to employees and consultants  excluding executive officers and directors 
exercisability  option price and other terms are determined by the board but the option price shall not be less than of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date 
stock options granted under the plan generally vest over a period of four years and expire seven to ten years from the date of grant 
as of october    stock options remain outstanding and  shares of common stock were reserved for future grants under this plan 
under our non employee directors stock option plan the directors plan   shares were authorized for issuance 
the directors plan provided for automatic grants to each non employee member of the board upon initial appointment or election to the board  upon reelection and for annual service on board committees 
the option price was not less than of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date 
under the directors plan  as originally adopted  new directors received an option for  shares  vesting in equal installments over four years 
in addition  each continuing director who was elected at an annual meeting of stockholders received an option for  shares and an additional option for  shares for each board committee membership  up to a maximum of two committee service grants per year 
in august  the board amended the directors plan in order to reduce the size of the initial and committee grants to  and  shares  respectively 
the annual and committee service option grants vest in full on the date immediately prior to the date of the annual meeting following their grant  assuming continued board or committee service through such date 
in the case of directors appointed to the board between annual meetings  the annual and any committee grants were prorated based upon the amount of time since the last annual meeting 
the directors plan expired as to future grants in october  as of october    stock options remain outstanding 
with the expiration of the directors plan  we expect to seek stockholder approval of a new plan for non employee directors at our annual meeting of stockholders 
we have assumed certain option plans in connection with acquisitions 
generally  the options granted under these plans have terms similar to our own options 
the exercise prices of such options have been adjusted to reflect the relative exchange ratios 
we do not intend to make future grants out of these option plans 
we monitor dilution related to our option program by comparing net option grants in a given fiscal period to the number of shares outstanding 
the dilution percentage is calculated as the new option grants for the fiscal period  net of options forfeited by employees leaving synopsys  divided by the total outstanding shares at the end of such fiscal period 
the option dilution percentages were and for fiscal and  respectively 
a summary of the distribution and dilutive effect of options granted is as follows year ended october  total grants  net of returns and cancellations  during the period as percentage of outstanding shares exclusive of options assumed in acquisitions grants to named executive officers  as defined below  during the period as a percentage of total options granted grants to named executive officers during the period as a percentage of outstanding shares total outstanding options held by named executive officers as a percentage of total options outstanding total grants  net of returns and cancellations  include the cancellation of approximately  options from a former named executive officer 
if these options had been included in the calculation  the net grants for fiscal as a percentage of outstanding shares would have been 
calculations based on named executive officers for each fiscal year 
a summary of our option activity and related weighted average exercise prices for fiscal is as follows options outstanding shares available for options of number shares weighted average exercise price in thousands  except per share amounts balance at october    grants   exercises  cancellations   additional shares reserved cancellation of shares reserved balance at october    shares remaining available for grant under the directors plan on the date of expiration of such plan
