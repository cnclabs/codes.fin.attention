executive overview 
fiscal was a significant year of investment for the company 
despite a difficult economic environment for its customers  the company successfully implemented many of the important operating initiatives outlined in last year s form k  while also achieving improved financial results 
the following are some of the more significant operating accomplishments during the opening of new stores  including stores in additional states  the addition of coolers which allow the company s stores to carry perishable products in the majority of stores  bringing the total number of stores with coolers to  at january  in addition  over  stores were certified and accepting electronic benefit transfers ebt  the rollout of automatic inventory replenishment to all stores  completed during the first quarter of  and the related improvement of inventory in stock levels  the rollout of the acceptance of the discover card and debit cards to all stores  the design completion and initiation of implementation of the ezstore project  which is designed to improve many facets of inventory flow from distribution centers to consumers and other areas of store operations  including labor scheduling  hiring and training and product presentation  the ongoing construction of the company s eighth distribution center in south carolina and substantial completion of expansion projects in other distribution facilities to increase overall distribution capacity  the implementation of a merchandising data warehouse  the increased store manager training and reduction of store manager turnover to under in in  the company will focus its efforts on accomplishing the following operating initiatives opening new dollar general stores  including at least new dollar general market stores  and continuing to look westward for further geographical expansion  continuing to invest in its ezstore project with the goal of rolling it out to half of its stores by the end of  reducing inventory levels on a per store basis by revisiting replenishment assumptions  safety stock levels needed in distribution centers and improving execution of selling through seasonal and other non core merchandise  continuing to test dollar general market store formats and additional geographic areas for these stores  continuing to focus on hiring practices and instilling increased accountability among the company s employees  identifying a location for and commencing construction on a ninth distribution center for a planned opening during the company can provide no assurance that it will be successful in executing these initiatives  nor can the company guarantee that the successful implementation of these initiatives will result in superior financial performance 
in addition to undertaking the operating initiatives described above  the company also intends to focus on and evaluate the status of certain other issues 
those issues are likely to include the appropriate level of share repurchases for in the company spent million repurchasing approximately million shares  the impact on the company  if any  from recent or potential legislation affecting minimum wages  the impact of increasing fuel costs  the impact of increasing health care and workers compensation costs  the progress of the wage and hour collective action litigation in the state of alabama  discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company s rating agency debt ratings 
the company measures itself against seven key financial metrics that it believes provide a well balanced perspective regarding its overall financial health 
these metrics  and their method of computation  are listed below earnings per share eps growth current year eps minus prior year eps divided by prior year eps equals percentage change  which is an indicator of the increased returns generated for the company s shareholders  total net sales growth current year total net sales minus prior year total net sales divided by prior year total net sales equals percentage change  which indicates  among other things  the success of the company s selection of new store locations and merchandising strategies  operating margin rate operating profit divided by net sales  which is an indicator of the company s success in leveraging its fixed costs and managing its variable costs  return on invested capital numerator net income plus interest expense  net of tax  plus rent expense  net of tax  denominator average long term debt plus average shareholders equity  both measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters  plus average rent expense multiplied by eight 
average rent expense is computed using a two year period although this measure is a not computed using generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company believes it is useful because return on invested capital measures the efficiency of the company s capital deployed in its operations  free cash flow the sum of net cash flows from operating activities  net cash flows from investing activities and net cash flows from financing activities  excluding share repurchases and changes in debt other than required payments 
although this measure is a non gaap measure  the company believes it is useful as an indicator of the cash flow generating capacity of the company s operations 
it is also a useful metric to analyze in conjunction with net income to determine whether there is any significant non cash component to the company s net income  inventory turns cost of goods sold for the year divided by average inventory balances  at cost  measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters which is an indicator of how well the company is managing the largest asset on its balance sheet  return on average assets net income for the year divided by average total assets  measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters  which is an overall indicator of the company s effectiveness in deploying its resources 
the company computes the above metrics using both gaap and certain non gaap information 
as discussed further below under results of operations  the company generally excludes items relating to the restatement of the company s financial results the restatement to more effectively evaluate the company s performance on a comparable and ongoing basis 
the company also pays particular attention to its same store sales growth  which is a sub category of its total sales growth  and its shrink performance  which is a sub category of its operating margin rate 
in and  the company experienced same store sales growth of and  respectively 
in and  the company s shrink  expressed in retail dollars as a percentage of sales  was for each year 
results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial performance is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth herein 
the company has included in this document certain financial information not derived in accordance with gaap  such as selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  net income and diluted earnings per share that exclude the impact of items relating to the restatement 
the company believes that this information is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the company s comparative year to year operating results 
this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with gaap 
management may use this information to better understand the company s underlying operating results 
reconciliations of these non gaap measures to the most comparable mea sure calculated in accordance with gaap are contained in the table below 
the company has restated its consolidated financial statements  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  for all previous years presented the restatement 
the following discussion of the company s results of operations incorporates the effects of this restatement 
for fiscal years and  the restatement reduced previously reported net income by approximately million and million  respectively  or approximately 
per diluted share in each year 
retained earnings at the beginning of have been reduced by approximately million to reflect the after tax impacts of earlier periods

increases in net sales resulted primarily from opening additional stores  including net new stores in  and a same store sales increase of for compared to same store sales calculations for a given period include only those stores that were open both at the end of that period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year 
the increase in same store sales accounted for million of the increase in sales while stores opened since the beginning of were the primary contributors to the remaining million sales increase during the increase in same store sales is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of customer transactions 
the company monitors its sales internally by the four major categories noted in the table above 
the company s merchandising mix in recent years has shifted to faster turning consumable products versus home products and clothing 
this has been driven by customer wants and needs in the marketplace 
as a result  over the past three years the highly consumable category has become a greater percentage of the company s overall sales mix while the percentages of the home products and basic clothing categories have declined 
accordingly  the company s sales increase by merchandise category in compared to was primarily attributable to the highly consumable category  which increased by million  or 
the company continually reviews its merchandise mix and adjusts it when deemed necessary as a part of its ongoing efforts to improve overall sales and gross profit 
thes e ongoing reviews may result in a shift in the company s merchandising strategy which could increase permanent markdowns in the future 
the company s sales increase in compared to resulted primarily from opening additional stores  including net new stores in  and a same store sales increase of for compared to the increase in same store sales accounted for million of the increase in sales while stores opened since the beginning of were the primary contributors to the remaining million sales increase during the company s sales increase by merchandise category in compared to was primarily attributable to the seasonal category  which increased by million  or  and the highly consumable category  which increased by million  or 
gross profit 
the gross profit rate increased basis points in as compared with although the company s margin rate is pressured by sales mix shifts to more highly consumable items  which typically carry lower gross profit rates  the company has been able to more than offset this through increases in gross markups on all merchandise categories 
more specific factors include the following higher initial mark ups on merchandise received during as compared with approximately basis points of gross margin improvement 
this improvement was achieved primarily from the positive impact of opportunistic purchasing  renegotiating product costs with several key suppliers  selective price increases  and an increase in various performance based vendor rebates 
higher average mark ups on the company s beginning inventory in as compared to approximately basis points of gross margin improvement 
this increased average mark up represents the cumulative impact of higher margin purchases over time 
these components of margin  which both positively impacted the company s results  were partially offset by an increase in transportation expenses as a percentage of sales approximately basis points of gross margin decline 
this increase resulted primarily from higher fuel costs in as compared to a nonrecurring favorable inventory adjustment in representing a change in the company s estimated provision for shrinkage approximately basis points of gross margin decline 
the gross profit rate increased basis points in as compared with primarily due to the following higher initial mark ups on merchandise received during as compared with approximately basis points of gross margin improvement 
this improvement was achieved primarily from increased purchases of higher margin seasonal and home product items  a increase in imported purchases  which carry higher than average mark ups  and a increase in various performance based vendor rebates 
a reduction in the company s shrink provision from in to in  calculated using retail dollars as a percentage of sales approximately basis points of gross margin improvement  at cost 
the company made progress in reducing the shrink at problem stores during but generally fell short of corporate goals 
higher average mark ups on the company s beginning inventory in as compared to approximately basis points of gross margin improvement 
this increased average mark up represents the cumulative impact of higher margin purchases over time 
a reduction in transportation expenses as a percentage of sales approximately basis points of gross margin improvement 
this reduction resulted primarily from system enhancements and improved process efficiencies in managing outbound freight costs  which contributed to an approximate decline in outbound cost per carton delivered in as compared to these components of margin  which all positively impacted the company s results  were partially offset by the impact of the company s lifo valuation adjustments in the fourth quarters of versus approximately basis points of gross margin decline 
in  the company recorded an million lifo adjustment  which had the effect of increasing gross margin and primarily resulted from the company s ability to lower its product costs through effective purchasing methods and the general lack of inflation during the period 
the company did not benefit from a comparable adjustment in primarily because the lifo reserves in certain inventory departments had been reduced to nominal amounts  or zero  in or prior years 
an increase in markdowns of basis points 
the increase in markdowns was due principally to increased christmas related markdowns compared to those the company had taken in the past and  to a lesser extent  markdowns taken to assist with the sale of both discontinued and slower moving apparel items 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of sales in as compared with was due to a number of factors  including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories that were in excess of the percent increase in sales store occupancy costs increased primarily due to rising average monthly rentals associated with the company s leased store locations  an increase in purchased services increased due primarily to fees associated with the increased customer usage of debit cards  professional fees increased primarily due to consulting fees associated with both the company s ezstore project and compliance with certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  and increased costs for inventory services increased due to both an increased number of physical inventories and a higher average cost per physical inventory 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in accruals for employee bonus expenses declined primarily related to higher bonus expense in related to the company s financial performance during the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of sales  excluding expenses relating to the restatement primarily professional fees  in as compared with was due to a number of factors  including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories that were in excess of the percentage increase in sales store labor increased primarily due to increases in store training related costs  the cost of workers compensation and other insurance programs increased primarily due to an increase in medical inflation costs experienced by the company compared to previous years  store occupancy costs increased primarily due to rising average monthly rentals associated with the company s leased store locations  and higher bonus expense increased related to the company s financial performance during penalty expense and litigation settlement proceeds 
as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company accrued million in with respect to a civil penalty related to its agreement in principle with the securities and exchange commission sec staff to settle the matters arising out of the company s restatement 
in  the company recorded million in net litigation settlement proceeds  which amount included million in insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of class action and shareholder derivative litigation  offset by a million settlement of a shareholder class action opt out claim  all of which related to the restatement 
interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to is due primarily to capitalized interest of million related to the company s dc construction and expansion projects in compared to million in and a reduction in amortization of debt issuance costs of million due in part to the amendment of the company s revolving credit facility in june the decrease in interest expense in as compared to is due primarily to debt reduction achieved during the average daily total debt outstanding over the past three years was as follows million at an average interest rate of  million at an average interest rate of  and million at an average interest rate of 
the increase in the company s average interest rate from to is due primarily to the reduction of variable rate debt 
all of the company s outstanding indebtedness at january  and january  was fixed rate debt 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the rate was lower than the rate primarily due to a net reduction in certain contingent income tax liabilities of approximately million recognized in the second quarter of  when the company adjusted its tax contingency reserve as the result of two state income tax examinations 
the tax rate in was negatively impacted by the million penalty expense in  as discussed above  which was not deductible for income tax purposes 
the lower effective tax rate in was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain state tax related items during liquidity and capital resources current financial condition recent developments 
during the past three years  the company has generated an aggregate of approximately billion in cash flows from operating activities 
during that period  the company has expanded the number of stores it operates by  stores and has incurred approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily to support this growth 
also during this three year period  the company has reduced its long term debt by approximately million and has expended approximately million for repurchases of its common stock 
the company s inventory balance represented approximately of its total assets as of january  the company s proficiency in managing its inventory balances can have a significant impact on the company s cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year 
for example  in  changes in inventory balances represented a million use of cash  as explained in more detail below  while in  changes in inventory balances represented an million source of cash 
inventory turns increased from times in to times in both and as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is involved in a number of legal actions and claims  some of which could potentially result in material cash payments 
adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect the company s liquidity 
the company also has certain income tax related contingencies as more fully described below under critical accounting policies and estimates 
estimates of these contingent liabilities are included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
on november   the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market conditions

share repurchases in increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 
the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations as of january  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total yr yrs yrs yrs long term debt a capital lease obligations financing obligations inventory purchase obligations interest b operating leases total contractual cash obligations a as discussed below  represents unsecured notes whose holders have a redemption option in  which could result in the accelerated payment of all or a portion of these obligations 
b represents obligations for interest payments on long term debt  capital lease and financing obligations 
the company has a million revolving credit facility the credit facility  which expires in june as of january   the company had no outstanding borrowings and million of standby letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility

cash flows provided by operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities for compared to declined by million 
the most significant component of the change in cash flows from operating activities was an increase in inventory levels in total merchandise inventories at the end of were billion compared to billion at the end of  a percent increase  or a percent increase on a per store basis  with the remainder primarily attributable to growth in the number of stores 
the largest portion of the increase in inventories resulted from the company s focus on improving in stock levels of core merchandise at the stores 
new initiatives  including the expansion of the perishable food program and the addition of certain core apparel items  magazines and hispanic food items also contributed to the inventory i ncrease 
in addition  due to an early easter in  the company received more seasonal merchandise for spring before the end of fiscal in  the company plans to focus on lowering its per store inventory levels 
cash flows in increased by million over related to changes in income taxes payable  primarily due to a large payment of federal income taxes for that was made in cash flows in the period were positively impacted by an increase in net income of million driven by improved operating results as more fully discussed above under results of operations 
cash flows from operations increased by million for compared to in  the company paid million in settlement of the class action lawsuit relating to the restatement  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  which did not recur in partially offsetting this cash outflow were tax benefits totaling approximately million  of which approximately million either directly or indirectly related to the company s restatement and subsequent litigation settlement 
the timing of these tax benefits was a significant component of the reduction of cash flows from deferred million and current million income taxes in compared to an increase in accrued liabilities resulted in a million increase in cash flows compared to due in part to the accrued sec penalty and increased bonuses described above  increased deferred compensation liabilities and increases in certain tax reserves 
contributing to the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in was an increase in net income of million driven by the improved operating results discussed above see  results of operations 
cash flows used in investing activities

the net repayment of debt in was undertaken to strengthen the company s financial position and was accomplished by utilizing cash flow from operations and existing cash balances 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to them 
in addition to the estimates presented below  there are other items within the company s financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
the company believes these estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used  the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole 
merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail last in  first out lifo method 
under the company s retail inventory method rim  the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales 
the rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
also  it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  initial markups  markdowns  and shrinkage  which significantly impact the gross profit calculation as well as the ending inventory valuation at cost 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted cost figures 
factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover  applying the rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise  inaccurate estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory at a store and the financial statement date  and inaccurate estimates of lower of cost or market lcm and or lifo reserves 
to reduce the potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory  the company s rim calculation through the end of utilized departments in which fairly homogenous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross margins were grouped 
in  in order to further refine its rim calculation  the company expanded the number of departments it utilizes for its gross margin calculation from to the impact of this change on the company s future consolidated financial statements is not currently expected to be material to a given fiscal year  although a given quarter could be impacted based on the mix of sales in the quarter 
other factors that reduce potential distortion include the use of historical experience in estimating the shrink provision see discussion below and the utilization of an independent statistician to assist in the lifo sampling proces s and index formulation 
also  on an ongoing basis  the company reviews and evaluates the salability of its inventory and records lcm reserves  if necessary 
the company calculates its shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period 
this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales and is determined by dividing the book to physical inventory adjustments recorded during the previous twelve months by the related sales for the same period for each store 
beginning in  in an effort to improve this estimate  the company began applying store specific shrink rates to store specific sales generated subsequent to a given store s physical inventory 
in  the company applied a weighted average shrink rate to all company sales generated subsequent to physical inventories 
to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than this estimated accrual  the company s effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting the estimated results to the actual results 
although the company performs physical inventories in all of its stores annually  the same stores do not necessarily get counted in the same reporting periods from year to year  which could impact comparability in a given reporting period 
during  the company implemented an item level perpetual inventory system for financial reporting purposes 
the new system provided better information regarding the type of inventory that the company owned and improved the company s ability to estimate its shrink provision as discussed above 
the utilization of this improved information in the company s rim calculation resulted in a non recurring inventory adjustment of approximately million  which favorably impacted gross profit in the third quarter of property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost 
the company groups its assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provides for depreciation on a straight line basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class  except for leasehold improvements  which are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
property and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
self insurance liability 
the company retains a significant portion of the risk for its workers compensation  employee health insurance  general liability  property loss and automobile coverage 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores 
provisions are made to this insurance liability on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed by an independent actuary utilizing historical claim trends 
if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns  the company may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions  which could be material to the company s future financial results 
contingent liabilities income taxes 
the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business 
the company estimates its contingent income tax liabilities based on its assessment of probable income tax related exposures and the anticipated settlement of those exposures translating into actual future liabilities 
the contingent liabilities are estimated based on both historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities and the company s interpretation of current income tax related trends 
if the company s income tax contingent liability estimates prove to be inaccurate  the resulting adjustments could be material to the company s future financial results 
contingent liabilities legal matters 
the company is subject to legal  regulatory and other proceedings and claims 
reserves  if any  are established for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present  in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in the company s financial statements and sec filings  management s view of the company s exposure 
the company reviews outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss 
these assessments are re evaluated each quarter or as new information becomes available to determine whether a reserve should be established or if any existing reserve should be adjusted 
the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded reserve 
in addition  because it is not permissible under gaap to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement

these and similar statements regarding events or results which the company expects will or may occur in the future are forward looking statements concerning matters that involve risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual performance of the company to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements 
all forward looking information should be evaluated in the context of these risks  uncertainties and other factors 
the words believe  anticipate  project  plan  expect  estimate  objective  forecast  goal  intend  will likely result  or will continue and similar expressions generally identify forward looking statements 
the company believes the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements are re asonable  however  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and therefore  actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
factors and risks that may result in actual results differing from such forward looking information include  but are not limited to those listed below  as well as other factors discussed throughout this document  including without limitation the factors described under critical accounting policies and estimates 
the company s business is moderately seasonal with the highest sales occurring during the fourth quarter 
adverse events during the fourth quarter could  therefore  affect the company s financial statements as a whole 
the company realizes a significant portion of its net sales and net income during the holiday selling season 
in anticipation of the holidays  the company purchases substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hires many temporary employees 
if for any reason the company s net sales during the holiday selling season were to fall below seasonal norms  a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result 
if such an imbalance were to occur  markdowns might be required to minimize this imbalance 
the company s profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdown s 
adverse weather conditions or other disruptions  especially during the peak holiday season but also at other times  could also adversely affect the company s net sales and could make it more difficult for the company to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from its suppliers 
competition in the retail industry could limit the company s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability 
the company competes in the discount retail merchandise business  which is highly competitive 
this competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced profitability resulting from reduced margins required to maintain the company s competitive position 
the company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers  including mass merchandise  grocery  drug  convenience  variety and other specialty stores 
some of the nation s largest retail companies operate stores in areas where the company operates 
the company s direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar  dollar tree  fred s  and various local  independent operators 
competitors fr om other retail categories include cvs  rite aid  walgreens  eckerd  wal mart and kmart 
the discount retail merchandise business is subject to excess capacity and some of the company s competitors are much larger and have substantially greater resources than the company 
the competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors  such as wal mart  have moved into the company s geographic markets 
the company remains vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these major national discount chains  and to the risk that these chains or others could venture into the dollar store industry in a significant way 
generally  the company expects an increase in competition 
the company s financial performance is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that may impact consumer spending 
a general slowdown in the united states economy may adversely affect the spending of the company s consumers  which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  interest rates  and tax rates  could also adversely affect the company s business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products 
existing military efforts and the possibility of war  acts of terrorism and rising fuel costs could adversely impact the company 
existing us military efforts  as well as the involvement of the united states in other military engagements  or a significant act of terrorism on us soil or elsewhere  could have an adverse impact on the company by  among other things  disrupting its information or distribution systems  causing dramatic increases in fuel prices thereby increasing the costs of doing business  or impeding the flow of imports or domestic products to the company 
the company s business is dependent on its ability to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from its vendors and to timely receive inventory 
the company believes that it has generally good relations with its vendors and that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors 
if the company fails to maintain good relations with its vendors  it may not be able to obtain attractive pricing with the consequence that its net sales or profit margins would be reduced 
the company may also face difficulty in obtaining needed inventory from its vendors because of interruptions in production or for other reasons  which would adversely affect the company s business 
also  prolonged or repeated price increases of certain raw materials could affect our vendors product costs  and  ultimately  the company s profitability 
the efficient operation of the company s business is heavily dependent on its information systems 
the company depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business 
the company relies on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support the company s business 
the software programs supporting many of the company s systems were licensed to the company by independent software developers 
the inability of these developers or the company to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company s operations if it were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 
in addition  costs and potential probl ems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company s operations 
the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing  investing and cash management activities 
the company may utilize its credit facility to fund working capital requirements  which is comprised of variable rate debt 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is dependent upon the smooth functioning of its distribution network and upon the capacity of its dcs 
the company relies upon the ability to replenish depleted inventory through deliveries to its dcs from vendors  and from the dcs to its stores by various means of transportation  including shipments by air  sea and truck on the roads and highways of the united states 
labor shortages in the trucking industry could negatively impact transportation costs 
in addition  long term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of service would adversely affect the company s business 
moreover  to facilitate its expected growth  the company will need additional dcs in the coming years 
if the company were unable to locate sites for the new dcs or were unable to achieve functionality of the new dcs in the time frame expected  the company s ability to achieve the expected growth could be inhibited 
construction and expansion projects relating to the company s dcs entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns  such as shortages of materials  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental or geological problems  weather interference  fires or other casualty losses  and unanticipated cost increases 
the completion dates and anticipated costs of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations for construction related or other reasons 
the company cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities of its senior management team and the performance of its employees 
the loss of services of key members of the company s senior management team or of certain other key employees could negatively impact the company s business 
in addition  future performance will depend upon the company s ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees to keep pace with its expansion schedule 
the inability to do so may limit the company s ability to effectively penetrate new market areas 
if the company cannot open new stores on schedule  its growth will be impeded 
delays in store openings could adversely affect the company s future operations by slowing new store growth  which may in turn reduce its revenue growth 
the company s ability to timely open new stores and to expand into additional states will depend in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations  the ability to negotiate favorable lease terms  the ability to hire and train new personnel  especially store managers  the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas  general economic conditions  and the availability of sufficient funds for expansion 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
the inability to execute operating initiatives could impact the company s operating results 
the company is undertaking a significant number of operating initiatives in that have the potential to be disruptive in the short term if they are not implemented effectively 
ineffective implementation or execution of some or all of these initiatives could negatively impact the company s operating results 
the company s cost of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal  state or local regulations 
unanticipated changes in the federal or state minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could adversely impact the company s ability to meet financial targets 
in addition  changes in these requirements or in federal  state or local regulations governing the sale of the company s products  particularly over the counter medications or health products  would increase the company s cost of doing business and  with respect to regulations governing the sale of products  could adversely and materially impact the company s sales results 
rising insurance costs and loss experience could negatively impact profitability 
the costs of insurance workers compensation insurance  general liability insurance  health insurance  property insurance and directors and officers liability insurance and loss experience have risen in recent years 
if such increases continue  they could have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
the company s reputation and financial condition could be affected by the sec investigation 
as previously disclosed in the company s periodic reports filed with the sec  the company restated its audited financial statements for fiscal years and  and certain unaudited financial information for fiscal year  by means of its form k for the fiscal year ended february   which was filed on january  the restatement 
the sec has been conducting an investigation into the circumstances giving rise to the restatement and  on january   the company received notice that the sec staff was considering recommending that the sec bring a civil injunctive action against the company for alleged violations of the federal securities laws in connection with circumstances relating to the restatement 
the company subsequently reached an agreement in principle with the sec staff to settle the matter 
under the terms of the agreement in principle  the company will consent  without admitting or denying the allegations in a complaint to be filed by the sec  to the entry of a permanent civil injunction against future violations of the antifraud  books and records  reporting and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws and related sec rules and will pay a million nondeductible civil penalty 
the agreement with the sec staff is subject to final approval by the court in which the sec s complaint is filed 
the company accrued million with respect to the penalty in its financial statements for the year ended january   and this accrual remains outstanding as of january  the company can give no assurances that the court will approve this agreement 
if the agreement is not approved  the company could be subject to different or additional penalties  both monetary and non monetary  which could adversely affect the company s financial statements as a whole 
the publicity surrounding the sec investigation and settlement also could affect the company s reputation and have an adverse impact on its financial statements as a whole

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates 
to minimize such risk  the company may periodically use financial instruments  including derivatives 
as a matter of policy  the company does not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors 
all financial instrument positions taken by the company are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of high correlation between the financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure 
the financial instruments used by the company are s traightforward instruments with liquid markets 
the company has cash flow exposure relating to variable interest rates associated with its revolving line of credit  and may periodically seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate derivatives 
the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate obligations is based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
at january  and january   the fair value of the company s debt  excluding capital lease obligations  was approximately million and million  respectively net of the fair value of a note receivable on the south boston  virginia dc of approximately million and million  respectively  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  based upon the estimated market value of the debt at those dates 
such fair value exceeded the carrying values of the debt at january  and january  by approximately million and million  respectively 
at february   the company was party to an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
the company designated this agreement as a hedge of its floating rate commitments relating to a portion of certain synthetic lease agreements that existed at that time 
under the terms of the agreement  the company paid a fixed rate of and received a floating rate libor on the million notional amount through september  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was million at february  the counterparty to the company s interest rate swap agreement was a major financial institution 
the interest rate swap agreement expired on september  as of january   the company was not party to any interest rate derivatives 
in  as required by sfas no 
 the company recorded the fair value of the interest rate swap in the balance sheet  with the offsetting  effective portion of the change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive loss  a separate component of shareholders equity in the consolidated financial statements 
amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss were reclassified into earnings  as an adjustment to interest expense  in the same period during which the hedged synthetic lease agreements affected earnings 
based upon the company s variable rate borrowing levels  a adverse change in interest rates would have resulted in a pre tax reduction of earnings and cash flows of less than million and approximately million in and  respectively  including the effects of interest rate swaps in in  the company had no outstanding variable rate borrowings 
based upon the company s outstanding indebtedness at january  and january   a reduction in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt of approximately million and million  respectively
