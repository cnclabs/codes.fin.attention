as further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  on march   the company announced that certain of its historical financial statements required restatement 
consequently  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december  and are being restated 
specifically  the company determined that the restatement was required because of a misapplication of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as it applies to three interest rate swaps that were entered into in and to fix the interest rates on variable rate debt incurred primarily for acquisitions in and the required changes affected the previously filed financial statements for the years ended december   and as well as for the quarters and the quarters through october  the foregoing restatement adjustments did not affect the company s reported cash and cash equivalents  or related cash flows  or income loss from operations in any of the above periods 
results of operations executive overview during the company experienced a significant increase in net sales and achieved solid profitability compared with during which it sustained a large net loss 
was a difficult year for both the company and for the life science industry  however  the situation began to turn around during the third quarter of and that trend continued throughout during  the company had pretax income of  after charges of  for a severance payment to the company s former european managing director and a  write down of inventory related to a discontinued product 
increased government funding of research and the easing of capital restraints on biotech companies helped the company domestically and the weak dollar played a role in significantly increasing the company s export business 
in addition  the full year effect of the acquisition of rs biotech  which was acquired in november  had a positive effect on results 
the company is a leading provider of a wide variety of research equipment and scientific instruments for the life sciences used to create  maintain and control the physical and biochemical conditions required for the growth  detection and storage of microorganisms 
the company s products are used for medical  biological  chemical and environmental research and for the commercial development of antibiotics  proteins  hormones  enzymes  monoclonal antibodies  agricultural products  fuels  vitamins  vaccines and other substances 
the company sells its equipment to pharmaceutical companies  agricultural and chemical companies  other industrial customers engaged in biotechnology  and to medical schools  universities  research institutes  hospitals  private laboratories and laboratories of federal  state and municipal government departments and agencies in the united states 
while only a small percentage of the company s sales are made directly to united states government departments and agencies  its domestic business is significantly affected by government expenditures and grants for research to educational research institutions and to industry 
the company also sells its equipment both directly primarily in western europe and through scientific equipment dealers to foreign companies  institutions and governments 
foreign sales may be affected by us export control regulations applicable to scientific equipment 
fisher scientific  the company s largest customer  is the exclusive us distributor of the company s c line and i series biological shakers and is the exclusive dealer for the company s co incubators in the us fisher scientific is also the exclusive distributor of the company s c line shakers in certain european countries and has a broader distribution arrangement with the company in canada and in france

   backlog ending 

  net sales increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  net sales increased in the us and internationally during the increase in sales was due principally to higher unit volume aided by the recovery in the economy  both in the united states and internationally  as the market for life science equipment rebounded from the last couple of years and as more government funding for research began to flow 
net sales also benefited from the inclusion of million in sales of rs biotech  which was acquired in november foreign sales were positively affected by the weakness of the us dollar and million resulted from the dollar s weakness when the net sales of the company s uk and european subsidiaries were translated into dollars 
excluding the foreign exchange effect  international sales increased for the year 
the increase in net sales involved most of the company s product lines 
orders increased during for the reasons discussed above relating to the increase in net sales and due to the continued demand for the company s cell culture  shaker  co incubator and freezer products 
the decrease in the backlog resulted from net sales exceeding net bookings due to reduced lead times to manufacture various products 
the following table summarizes consolidated backlog  orders and net sales for the years ended december  and in thousands of dollars increase decrease change backlog beginning    add orders received 
   less net sales 


   backlog ending 

   net sales declined during as compared with net sales  however  the decline in orders in was since net sales in were bolstered by a significant reduction in backlog of  while net sales in were negatively affected by a  increase in backlog 
the increase in backlog in resulted from increased orders late in the year for the company s sterilizable in place fermentors  which require up to four months to manufacture as well as other fermentation products and innova incubator shakers 
the reduction in backlog in was the result of improvements in manufacturing efficiencies allowing the company to substantially decrease average lead times 
the major areas of decline in in net sales were in biological shakers with a decrease of in sales to fisher scientific accounting for a significant portion of the decline fisher s sales of the company s products to its customers declined but they substantially reduced their inventory of the company s products during  and a decrease of in sales of cell culture equipment 
all of the company s operating units experienced lower sales during due to the lingering weakness in demand for life science equipment both in the united states and in our export markets as a result of tight government funding  reduced capital spending by pharmaceutical companies and by significantly reduced spending by biotechnology companies due to their difficulty in raising capital 
however  towards the latter part of biotech funding once again became available and capital spending by both industry and government picked up resulting in a relatively strong year for the company both in shipments and in orders 
gross margin the following table shows gross profit and gross margin for the years ended december   and in thousands of dollars net sales 

   cost of sales    gross profit 
   gross margin 
the increase in gross margin to for the year ended december  from in was due primarily to the effect of increased absorption of manufacturing overhead due to greater manufacturing activity as a result of higher sales volumes  partially offset by increases in steel prices and higher transportation costs due to fuel surcharges and the write off of  of inventory related to a discontinued product 
gross margin decreased to during the year ended december  from in due to the effect of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead as a result of lower manufacturing activity  a less favorable product mix and downward pressure on prices as a consequence of a number of competitors chasing after a smaller amount of business 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to  for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the foreign exchange translation effect of the weak dollar on the expenses of the company s european subsidiaries amounting to  the inclusion of the selling  general and administrative expenses of rs biotech acquired in november  the provision for incentive bonuses in vs 
none in and a severance payment to the company s european managing director  which amounted to approximately in  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  to  from  in during  the company effected a reduction in force  which resulted in the payment of  in severance costs and also relocated certain operations and assigned the lease for one of its united kingdom facilities to another company incurring approximately  of lease assignment costs in the process 
the lease assignment relieved the company of the on going expenses of the facility  which is expected to result in annual savings of approximately  net of the costs of a new  smaller leased facility 
it should also be noted that as a result of the weak dollar  expenses of the company s european subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars at exchange rates were  higher than if exchange rates had remained at levels 
the primary reasons for the decrease were the fact that in no incentive bonuses were accrued due to the company having not achieved its performance targets and from the savings realized from the reduction in force and other belt tightening measures undertaken during the year 
research  development and engineering primarily as a result of the inclusion of the expenses of rs biotech acquired in november  r d and engineering expenses increased  for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  during  the company placed a great deal of emphasis on strengthening its product engineering efforts and in this regard added to staff and incurred higher costs for prototypes and consultants resulting in an increase of in expenses compared with interest expense interest expense increased to  during the year ended december  from  in due to the higher level of debt  which was incurred during the latter part of to finance the acquisition of rs biotech and to the purchase of certain equipment 
in addition  interest expense was also affected by and includes the changes in the carrying value of interest rate swaps which fixed the interest rates on certain variable rate debt  which had not been designated as effective hedges 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during  interest expense decreased to  compared with  for primarily as a result of changes in the carrying value of one of the aforementioned interest rate swaps 
the change in value of the interest rate swaps had a favorable effect on interest expense of  and  in and  respectively  and an unfavorable effect of  in the company intends to appropriately document and designate the three interest rate swaps as effective cash flow hedges as soon as practicable

income tax expense the company s effective income tax rate of for the year ended december  is higher than might otherwise be expected due to losses incurred by some of the company s european subsidiaries for which no financial statement tax benefit was provided due to the company s inability to carry back the losses 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was  on a pretax loss of  compared with income tax expense of  in  an effective rate of 
the expense  in a situation where a tax benefit would be usual  is principally due to the inability to carry back losses incurred by the company s european subsidiaries resulting in no financial statement tax benefit in currency translation during and  the dollar weakened against the currencies of the european countries where the company has subsidiary operations

the company expects that the bank agreement will be renewed prior to its expiration date 
the maturity of the acquisition portion of the credit facility with respect to a acquisition is december  and with respect to a acquisition is november there are no compensating balance requirements and any borrowings under the bank agreement bear interest at the bank s prime rate less basis points or libor plus basis points  at the discretion of the company 
at december   the bank s prime rate was and libor was 
since the bank agreement requires that all borrowings be at variable interest rates  the bank provides the company with a mechanism to fix interest rates on borrowings by use of interest rate swaps 
at december   the company had three interest rate swaps in place to fix the interest rates  primarily for debt incurred for acquisitions in and on september  the bank agreement was amended to temporarily ease the financial ratio requirements under the negative covenant provisions of the bank agreement and to reduce the acquisition line from million to million 
among the changes was to omit the requirement to meet the debt service ratio during the period ended september   a change in the minimum equity that must be maintained  as well as the maintenance of a minimum million cash balance 
in addition  the interest rate on new borrowings under the bank agreement was increased by basis points 
at december   the company met the financial ratios that were in force prior to this amendment and all of the terms  financial ratios and requirements as well as interest rates reverted back to what they were prior to the september  amendment 
all of the company s domestic assets  which are not otherwise subject to lien  have been pledged as security for any borrowings under the bank agreement 
the bank agreement contains various business and financial covenants including among other things  a debt service ratio  a net worth covenant and a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth

critical accounting policies no changes have been made in the company s critical accounting policies during the year ended december  the securities and exchange commission sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the company s annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management considers the following policies to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with the fob terms of orders  generally when products are shipped 
the company s products are tested by its quality assurance department prior to shipment 
the company has no other obligation associated with its products once shipment has occurred except for customary warranty provisions 
historically  returns have been immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements and are projected to remain at a consistent immaterial level in the future 
the company reports all amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and includes all costs incurred for shipping and handling as cost of sales 
the company also provides certain contract fermentation services for which revenue is recorded at the time the materials are shipped to the customer  in accordance with the terms of the underlying purchase order 
the purchase orders have historically had a very low cancellation rate 
the company s products carry limited warranties that in general do not exceed one year from date of sale with the exception of ultra low temperature freezers that carry a year warranty and certain shaker products that carry a year warranty 
the company accrues estimated product warranty costs based on historical trends at the time of sale and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the company periodically sells maintenance contracts to certain customers 
the value of such contracts is deferred and recognized into revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimate is based on managements review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization is tested annually for impairment and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
an impairment loss for goodwill is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the company exceeds its fair value 
the tradename value  which is being amortized over years  is tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event as defined by sfas no 
deferred income taxes a valuation allowance has been recorded for certain deferred tax assets principally related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards  domestic capital loss carryforwards and contribution carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
accounts receivable the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the collectibility of balances due  the credit worthiness of the customer and its current level of business with the customer 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates as it seeks debt financing to make capital expenditures  potential acquisitions and invest in cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
cash equivalents and other marketable investments are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company is also exposed to certain foreign exchange risk 
at times  management might employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging to manage interest rate  foreign currency or other exposures 
further  the company does not expect its market risk exposures to change significantly in the near term 
at december   the outstanding borrowings of the company consisted primarily of variable rate long term debt the large majority of which has been fixed through interest rate swaps  which had a carrying value of  and a fair value of approximately  assuming other factors are held constant  interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt  but do not impact the carrying value  earnings or cash flows 
accordingly  assuming a hypothetical increase of in interest rates and all other variables remaining constant  interest expense would not change  however  the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease by approximately in addition  as interest rates change  the fair value of the interest rate swaps also changes 
the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps  as further discussed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  are recorded as a component of interest expense in the statement of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r supersedes apb no 
and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the company is required to implement the proposed standard no later than july  the cumulative effect of adoption  applied on a modified prospective basis  would be measured and recognized on july  the company is currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions related to its stock compensation plans 
current estimates of option values using the black scholes method may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted 
in december   the fasb issued fasb staff position accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  in response to the american jobs creation act of which was signed into law in october  and which provides for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated as defined 
based on the company s decision to reinvest rather than to repatriate current and prior year s unremitted foreign earnings  the application of fsp did not affect income tax expense in the period of enactment or any related disclosures 
in november   the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting by working with the international accounting standards board iasb toward development of a single set of high quality accounting standards 
the fasb and the iasb noted that arb  chapter and ias  inventories  require that abnormal amounts of idle freight  handling costs  and wasted materials be recognized as period costs  however  the boards noted that differences in the wording of the two standards could lead to inconsistent application of those similar requirements 
the fasb concluded that clarifying the existing requirements in arb by adopting language similar to that used in ias is consistent with its goals of improving financial reporting in the united states and promoting convergence of accounting standards internationally 
adoption of sfas is required for fiscal years beginning after june  the provisions of sfas will be applied prospectively and are not expected to have a material impact on results of operations and financial position of the company
