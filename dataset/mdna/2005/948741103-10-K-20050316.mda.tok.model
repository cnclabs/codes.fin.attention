item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
the results of operations and financial condition of the company  as reflected in the accompanying statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of the company s tenants 
executive overview wri focuses on increasing funds from operations and dividend payments to our common shareholders through hands on leasing and management of the existing portfolio of properties  through disciplined growth from selective acquisitions and new developments  and through the disposition of assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria 
the company is also committed to maintaining a conservative balance sheet  a well staggered debt maturity schedule and strong credit agency ratings 
at december   wri owned or operated under long term leases  either directly or through our interest in joint ventures or partnerships  a total of developed income producing properties and five properties that are in various stages of development 
our properties are located in states that span the southern half of the united states from coast to coast and include shopping centers and industrial properties 
wri has approximately  leases and  different tenants 
leases for our properties range from less than a year for smaller spaces to over years for larger tenants 
leases generally include minimum lease payments which often increase over the lease term  reimbursements of property operating expenses  including ad valorem taxes  and additional rent payments based on a percentage of the tenants sales 
the majority of our anchor tenants are supermarkets  value oriented apparel discount stores and other retailers or service providers who generally sell basic necessity type goods and services 
we believe stability of our anchor tenants  combined with convenient locations  attractive and well maintained properties  high quality retailers and a strong tenant mix  should ensure the long term success of our merchants and the viability of our portfolio 
in assessing the performance of the company s properties  management carefully tracks the occupancy of the company s portfolio 
occupancy for the total portfolio was as of year end compared to as of year end  due to increases in both the shopping center and industrial portfolios 
another important indicator of performance is the spread in rental rates on a same space basis as we complete new leases and renew existing leases 
in wri completed  new leases or renewals for the year totaling million square feet  increasing rental rates an average of on a same space basis 

table of contents with respect to external growth through acquisitions and new developments  management closely monitors movements in returns in relation to wri s blended weighted average cost of capital  the amount of product in its acquisition and new development pipelines and the geographic areas in which opportunities are present 
the company purchased shopping centers  two industrial properties and our partners interest in four existing shopping centers during  comprising million square feet  and representing a total investment of million 
our purchases include eleven properties in texas primarily in the rio grande valley  five in georgia  three in north carolina  two each in california  florida  new mexico and kentucky  and one in missouri 
kentucky represents the th state in which wri operates  and was a logical expansion given wri s geographic footprint in the southern part of the united states from coast to coast 
with respect to new development  wri completed projects during totaling  square feet  representing an investment of million 
as with acquisitions  management closely monitors returns on new opportunities as well as performance against underwritten returns on projects under development 
projects completed in are leased 
wri commenced three new developments in resulting in five shopping centers in various stages of development in arizona  colorado  north carolina  and utah 
we anticipate that the majority of these centers should come on line during continuing our strategy of selling assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria  we disposed of six properties during the year 
these property sales represented a total of  square feet and provided proceeds of million  generating a gain of million 
wri continues to maintain a strong  conservative capital structure  which provides ready access to a variety of attractive capital sources 
the strength of wri s balance sheet is evidenced by unsecured debt ratings of a by standard and poor s and a by moody s rating services  the highest combined ratings of any public reit 
we carefully balance obtaining low cost financing with minimizing exposure to interest rate movements  matching long term liabilities with the long term assets acquired or developed 
in executing this strategy  we redeemed our series c cumulative redeemable preferred shares in april and issued million and million of common shares of beneficial interest in march and august of  respectively 
in july we issued million of depositary shares each representing one hundredth of a series e cumulative redeemable preferred share that pays a annual dividend 
we also issued million of unsecured fixed rate medium term notes during the year with a weighted average rate of  net of the effect of related interest rate swaps  and a weighted average term of years 
with respect to future trends  management expects continued improvement in the performance of the existing portfolio through strong occupancy and increases in rental rates as the economy trends upward 
any deterioration in the economy could alter these expectations 
with respect to external growth  we have already closed two acquisitions totaling million in and have over million of properties in the pipeline 
each of these potential acquisitions is still subject to a stringent due diligence process and  therefore  there is no assurance that any or all will be purchased 
changes in interest rates and the capitalization rates inherent in the pricing of acquisitions could affect our external growth prospects in summary of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of wri and its subsidiaries  as well as of the accounts of joint ventures and partnerships over which wri exercises financial and operating control and the related amounts of minority interests 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
investments in joint ventures and partnerships where wri has the ability to exercise significant influence  but does not exercise financial and operating control  are accounted for using the equity method 
wri has determined that it is not required to consolidate any entities under the variable interest guidelines set forth in fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
valuation of receivables an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable is determined based upon an analysis of balances outstanding  historical bad debt levels  tenant credit worthiness and current economic trends 
balances outstanding include base rents  tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to the straight lining of rental commitments 
additionally  estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims with respect to tenants in bankruptcy is considered in assessing the collectibility of the related receivables 
property real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  which  in the opinion of management  is not in excess of the individual property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows  including estimated proceeds from disposition 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and years for parking lot surfacing and equipment 
major replacements where the betterment extends the useful life of the asset are capitalized and the replaced asset and corresponding accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts 
all other maintenance and repair items are charged to expense as incurred 
upon acquisition of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings on an as if vacant basis  acquired out of market and in place leases  and tenant relationships and acquired liabilities  and allocate the purchase price based on these assessments 
these fair value assessments are based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and specific market economic conditions that may affect the property 
property also includes costs incurred in the development of new operating properties 
these costs include preacquisition costs directly identifiable with the specific project  development and construction costs  interest and real estate taxes 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits  travel and other related costs that are clearly attributable to the development of the property  are also capitalized 
the capitalization of such costs ceases at the earlier of one year from the completion of major construction or when the property  or any completed portion  becomes available for occupancy 
wri s properties are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
in such an event  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property 
such carrying amount would be adjusted  if necessary  to estimated fair value to reflect an impairment in the value of the asset 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december revenues total revenues increased by million or in million in versus million in

table of contents funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts defines funds from operations as net income loss available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for wri s share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in addition  nareit recommends that extraordinary items not be considered in arriving at ffo 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 
we believe ffo is an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because it helps investors compare the operating performance of our company relative to other reits 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by wri is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness 
funds from operations is calculated as follows in thousands year ended december  net income available to common shareholders depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures gain on sale of properties gain loss on sale of properties of unconsolidated joint ventures funds from operations funds from operations attributable to operating partnership units funds from operations assuming conversion of op units weighted average shares outstanding basic effect of dilutive securities share options and awards operating partnership units weighted average shares outstanding diluted effects of inflation the rate of inflation was relatively unchanged in wri has structured its leases  however  in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby wri receives increased rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of wri s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allows wri to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of wri s leases also require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon wri s operating results as they are absorbed by the tenants 

table of contents capital resources and liquidity wri s primary liquidity needs are payment of its common and preferred dividends  maintaining and operating our existing properties  payment of our debt service costs  and funding planned growth through acquisitions and new development 
we anticipate that cash flows from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for all common and preferred dividend payments and debt service costs  as well as the capital necessary to maintain and operate our existing properties 
our primary source of capital for funding acquisitions and new development is our million revolving credit facility coupled with cash generated from dispositions of properties that no longer meet our investment criteria and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement are retired as needed with proceeds from the issuance of long term unsecured debt and common and preferred equity 
as of december  the balance outstanding on our million revolving credit facility was million 
our capital structure also includes nonrecourse secured debt that we assume in conjunction with some of our acquisitions 
we also have nonrecourse debt secured by newly developed properties held in several of our joint ventures 
we hedge the future cash flows of certain debt transactions  as well as changes in the fair value of our debt instruments  principally through interest rate swaps with major financial institutions 
we generally have the right to sell or otherwise dispose of our assets except in certain cases where we are required to obtain a third party consent  such as assets held in entities in which we have less than ownership 
investing activities acquisitions during we invested million in the acquisition of operating properties 
of this total  million was invested in shopping centers which includes the purchase of our partners interest in four of our existing centers  million was invested in two industrial projects  and an additional million was invested in five retail properties  each through a owned unconsolidated joint venture 
nonrecourse secured debt totaling million  of which million was held by joint ventures or partnerships in which we participate  was assumed in conjunction with these purchases 
the cash requirements for all acquisitions in were initially financed under wri s revolving credit facilities 
investing activities new development and capital expenditures with respect to new development  wri completed projects during totaling million square feet  representing an investment of million 
as of december   wri had five retail developments underway in which we invested million during and expect to invest approximately million in these projects should come on line during all new development in was initially financed under wri s revolving credit facilities 
capital expenditures for additions to the existing portfolio  acquisitions  and new development totaled million in and million in wri s share of capital expenditures for unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships  including the purchase and development of properties by newly formed joint ventures or partnerships was million in and million in financing activities debt total debt outstanding increased to billion at december  from billion at december   due primarily to funding of acquisitions and new development 
total debt at december  includes billion on which interest rates are fixed and million which bears interest at variable rates  including the effect of million of interest rate swaps 
additionally  debt totaling million was secured by operating properties while the remaining billion was unsecured 
wri has a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that bears an interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the facility allows wri to hold auctions at lower pricing for up to million 
the facility expires in november  but allows a one year extension at our option 
the facility can be increased to million at our option prior to november as of december   wri is in full compliance with the amended and restated credit agreement currently in place 
wri also has an unsecured and uncommitted overnight credit facility totaling million to be used for cash management purposes 

table of contents during the year ended december   wri issued a total of million of unsecured fixed rate medium term notes with a weighted average interest rate of  net of the effect of related interest rate swaps  and a weighted average term of years 
proceeds received from the medium term note issuances were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities 
during we settled various interest rate swaps entered into in to hedge interest payments on future debt 
in we also entered into interest rate swaps to convert million of our fixed rate debt to variable interest rates 
the effect of the interest rate swap activity in and was to decrease interest expense and increase net income by million and million  respectively  and to decrease the average rate on our debt by 
in both years 
in interest rate swap activity increased interest expense and decreased net income by 
million and increased the average rate on our debt by 
at december   we had ten interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that convert fixed rate interest payments at rates ranging from to to variable interest payments 
wri could be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter party  however  management believes the likelihood of such nonperformance to be remote 
in conjunction with acquisitions completed during  we assumed million of nonrecourse debt secured by the related properties 
as of december   the balance of this secured debt related to wholly owned properties was million which had a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average remaining life of years 
as of december   the balance of this secured debt related to joint venture or partnership properties in which we participate was million which had a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average remaining life of years 
financing activities equity common and preferred dividends increased to million in  compared to million in and million in wri satisfied its reit requirement of distributing at least of ordinary taxable income for each of the three years ending december  our dividend payout ratio on common equity for  and approximated  and  respectively  based on funds from operations for the applicable year 
we do not have a common share buyback program 
in september the sec declared effective two additional shelf registration statements totaling billion  all of which was available as of march  in addition  we have million available as of march  under our billion shelf registration statement  which became effective in april we will continue to closely monitor both the debt and equity markets and carefully consider our available financing alternatives  including both public and private placements 
in february a three for two share split  effected in the form of a share dividend  was declared for shareholders of record on march   payable march  we issued million common shares of beneficial interest as a result of the share split 
all references to the number of shares and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the share split  and an amount equal to the par value of the number of common shares issued have been reclassified to common shares of beneficial interest from accumulated dividends in excess of net income 
in march we issued an additional million common shares of beneficial interest 
net proceeds to us totaled million 
the proceeds from this offering were used primarily to redeem our series c cumulative redeemable preferred shares on april  the unamortized original issuance costs of million for these shares were reported as a loss in arriving at operating income 
in august we issued an additional million common shares of beneficial interest 
net proceeds to us totaled million 
the proceeds from this offering were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 

table of contents in july we issued million of depositary shares 
each depositary share represents one hundredth of a series e cumulative redeemable preferred share 
the depositary shares are redeemable  in whole or in part  for cash on or after july  at our option  at a redemption price of per depositary share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon 
the depositary shares are not convertible or exchangeable for any of our other property or securities 
the series e preferred shares pay a annual dividend and have a liquidation value of  per share 
net proceeds of million were utilized to pay down amounts outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 
in april we issued million of depositary shares

the depositary shares are not convertible or exchangeable for any other property or securities of wri 
net proceeds of million were used to redeem the series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares 
in october we issued million common shares of beneficial interest 
net proceeds to us totaled million 
in november we issued an additional million common shares of beneficial interest 
net proceeds to us totaled million 
the proceeds from the above offerings were used primarily to redeem our series b preferred shares in december contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december  in thousands thereafter total unsecured debt medium term notes bonds revolving credit facilities secured debt ground lease payments obligations to acquire develop projects total contractual obligations total unsecured debt obligations as shown above are million more than total unsecured debt as reported due to the unamortized discount on medium term notes and the fair value of interest rate swaps 
as of year end and  we believe we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
newly adopted accounting pronouncements in december fasb issued interpretation no 
r to replace interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
it further requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate  but in which it has a significant variable interest 
we have applied fin r to our joint ventures and concluded that it did not require consolidation of additional entities 

table of contents in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
this accounting standard focuses primarily on equity transactions with employees and will be effective in our reporting for the quarter ending september  currently we record compensation expense over the vesting period on awards granted since january  awards granted prior to january  are not recorded as compensation expense but their impact on net income is disclosed 
under sfas no 
r  we will record compensation expense on those awards granted prior to january  as they vest 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
r will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
forward looking statements this annual report includes certain forward looking statements reflecting wri s expectations in the near term that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  however  many factors may materially affect the actual results  including demand for our properties  changes in rental and occupancy rates  changes in property operating costs  interest rate fluctuations  and changes in local and general economic conditions 
accordingly  there is no assurance that wri s expectations will be realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance our capital requirements 
these transactions expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk  primarily interest rate swap agreements with major financial institutions 
these swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the swaps 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the net effect of million notional amount of interest rate swaps 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points  net income and future cash flows would decrease million based upon the variable rate debt and notes receivable outstanding at december
