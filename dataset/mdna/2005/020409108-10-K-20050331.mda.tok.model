item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate in two service line groups home health care and adult day care adc 
the home health care group consists of two reportable segments  visiting nurse vn and personal care pc while the adc service line is also a separate reportable segment 
reportable segments have been identified based upon how we have organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our vn segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes largely to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
vn medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or day of care 
approximately of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
our pc segment services are also provided in patients homes 
these services generally provided by para professional staff such as home health aides are generally of a custodial rather than skilled nature 
pc revenues are generated on an hourly basis 
approximately of the pc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients 
our adc segment provides professional  high quality adult day care to disabled or frail adults who require some care or supervision  but who do not require intensive medical attention and or wish not to live in a nursing home or other inpatient institution 
these services are provided in our physical facilities 
adc revenues are usually generated on a per day of care basis 
approximately of the adc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients 
the presentation of the company s operations in three segments differs from its previous reporting of two segments due to a reorganization of the way in which the company manages its business and in the way in which information is reported  both of which resulted from refinements in the company s business plan adopted in early segment data for previous periods have been restated to conform to the new reporting structure 
our view on reimbursement and diversification of risk our company is highly dependent on government reimbursement programs which pay for the majority of the services we provide to our patients 
reimbursement under these programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  is subject to frequent changes as policy makers balance their own needs to meet the health care needs of constituents while also meeting their fiscal objectives 
we believe that an important key to our historical success and to our future success is our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur 
one important way in which we have achieved this adaptability in the past  and in which we plan to achieve it in the future  is to maintain some level of diversification in our business mix 
the execution of our business plan will increase the emphasis we place on our visiting nurse operations 
our personal care and adult day care operations will help us maintain a level of diversification of reimbursement risk that we believe is appropriate 
our business plan our future success depends on our ability to execute our business plan 
over the next three to five years we will try to accomplish the following o generate meaningful same store sales growth through the focused provision of high quality services and attending to the needs of our patients  o expand the significance of our visiting nurse  medicare based  home health services by selectively acquiring other quality providers and through the startup of new agencies  and o expand our capital base through both earnings performance and by seeking additional capital investments in our company 
based on our business plan  we expect our visiting nurse revenues to grow from under one third of total revenues to about one half of total revenues sometime in the next three to five years 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in the specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 
receivables and revenue recognition we recognize revenues when patient services are provided 
our receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by us to be their net realizable values 
the company is paid for its services primarily by federal and state third party reimbursement programs  commercial insurance companies  and patients 
revenues are recorded at established rates in the period during which the services are rendered 
appropriate allowances to give recognition to third party payment arrangements are recorded when the services are rendered 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
it is common for issues to arise related to the determination of cost reimbursed revenues  medical coding  particularly with respect to medicare  patient eligibility  particularly related to medicaid  and other reasons unrelated to credit risk  all of which may result in adjustments to recorded revenue amounts 
management continuously evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and when appropriate provides allowances for losses based upon the best available information 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by material amounts in the near term 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor types  historical collection trends and aging categories 
we calculate our reserve for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the percentage applied to the receivable balances in the various aging categories is based on historical collection experience 
insurance programs we bear significant insurance risk under our large deductible automobile and workers compensation insurance programs and our self insured employee health program 
under our automobile insurance program  we bear risk up to  per incident 
under our workers compensation insurance program  we bear risk up to  per incident 
we purchase stop loss insurance for our employee health plan that places a specific limit  generally  on our exposure for any individual covered life 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we also know of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry insurance coverage for this exposure  however  our deductible per claim increased from  to  effective april  we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate 
as part of our on going risk management and cost control efforts  we continually seek alternatives that might provide a different balance of cost and risk  including potentially accepting additional self insurance risk in lieu of higher premium costs 
impairment of property  equipment and intangible assets we evaluate our property and equipment and intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or the estimated useful life of the assets may need to be changed 
we consider internal and external factors of the individual facility or asset  including changes in the regulatory environment  changes in national health care trends  current period cash flow loss combined with a history of cash flow losses and local market developments 
if these factors and the projected undiscounted cash flow of the facility or asset over the asset s remaining life indicate that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered  the carrying value will be adjusted to its fair value if it is lower 
there were no impairment charges recorded during the year ended december   however  if the projections or our assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for our assets 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
these statements established new accounting and reporting standards for business combinations and associated goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas eliminated the pooling of interest method of accounting and amortization of goodwill for business combinations initiated after june  sfas  effective january   requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives can no longer be amortized  but instead must be tested for impairment at least annually 
we completed the required initial test for impairment upon adoption in and concluded that no impairment exists 
in addition  we completed the required annual tests for impairment in and and concluded that no impairment exists 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
this statement supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions for apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and it broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
we adopted sfas on january   and there was no effect on our financial position and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes as of december   we have net deferred tax assets of approximately  the net deferred tax asset is composed of approximately  of long term deferred tax liabilities and  of long term deferred tax assets 
we have provided a valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets based upon our estimation of realizability of those assets through future taxable income 
this valuation was based in large part on our history of generating operating income or losses in individual tax locales and expectations for the future 
our ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  competitive pressures on revenues and margins and legislation and regulation at all levels of government 
we have considered the above factors in reaching our conclusion that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets net of the valuation allowance as of december  however  there can be no assurances that we will meet our expectations of future taxable income 
during the year ended december   based on changes in facts and circumstances  favorable changes occurred in the company s expectations with regard to the generation of future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
accordingly  the state and local tax provision for   and included a reduction of previously recorded valuation allowances of approximately   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we recorded in income from discontinued operations  a one time reduction in estimated tax liabilities of approximately  due to the expiration of various statutory limitations pertaining to the tax year in which we sold our product operations 
seasonality visiting nurse segment our visiting nurse segment operations located in florida normally experience higher admissions during the march quarter than in the other quarters due to seasonal population fluctuations 
adc segment our adc segment normally experiences seasonality in its operating results 
specifically  the quarters ended december and march typically generate lower operating income than the quarters ended june and september as the holiday season and winter weather tend to temporarily lower adc in center attendance

vn revenue growth was driven by admissions growth as we continue to execute our strategic plan and increase our focus on this segment 
the decline in adc revenue resulted from lower attendance in our facilities due to market conditions including state medicaid program efforts to constrain the rate of growth in spending 
vn operating income grew on the increases in admissions and revenues 
pc operating income declined due to shifts in the mix of our business  increased general and administrative costs and increased provision for uncollectible accounts 
adc operating income increased slightly due to lower general and administrative costs resulting from staff reductions and our reorganization of segment management in early refer to the discussion of each segment below 
in the quarter ended september  four hurricanes hit the state of florida 
these hurricanes had the effect of reducing vn operating income by approximately  and net income by approximately  the effective income tax rate was approximately of income before income taxes for compared to in the tax provision from continuing operations for included a credit of  or per diluted share related to the elimination of a valuation allowance on certain state tax net operating loss carry forwards 
visiting nurse segment year ended december  and approximately of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
in addition to our focus on operating income from the visiting nurse segment  we also measure this segment s performance in terms of admissions  patient months of care  revenue per patient month and cost of services per patient month 
year ended december december change amount rev amount rev amount net revenues    cost of services    general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    uncollectible accounts    operating income    admissions    patient months of care    revenue per patient month   cost of services per patient month billable visits    vn contribution for the year ended december  was million versus million last year despite the effect of florida hurricanes which lowered operating income by approximately  admissions grew about over the prior year while patient months increased reflecting a reduction in the average length of stay 
revenue per patient month increased about primarily due to higher medicare rates between periods 
operating costs per patient month also increased about due to increased staffing and insurance costs 
in march  the company received medicare certification for a new start up agency in melbourne fl 
in april  the company received medicare certification for a new start up agency in bradenton fl 
these operations contributed revenues of approximately million and operating income of approximately  in the year ended december in the quarter ended december   the company purchased a startup agency in orlando  florida and started medicare operations in cleveland  akron and youngstown  ohio 
these operations contributed revenues of approximately  and operating losses of approximately  general and administrative expenses declined due to staff reductions and the reorganization of segment operations in early personal care pc segment year ended december  and approximately of the pc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients

revenue per billable hour decreased from prior year primarily due to changes in mix 
certain of our pc markets experienced inordinate declines in volumes  while others experienced volume growth 
significant volume declines in two particular markets were more than offset by volume growth in certain other lower margin markets 
these changes in our business resulted in aggregate cost of services growing faster than aggregate revenues 
general administrative expenses in total and as a percentage of revenues increased due to our management reorganization which added staff to the pc management team 
our provision for uncollectible accounts in pc in the year ended december  was higher than the prior year primarily due to an increasing difficulty being experienced in the collection of accounts from certain state medicaid programs 
depreciation and amortization increased due to investments made in information systems 
adult day care adc segment year ended december  and continuing operations approximately of the adc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients

patient days of care declined due to lower attendance in our facilities 
we believe that the lower attendance is related primarily to market conditions including state medicaid program efforts to constrain the rate of growth in spending 
cost of services grew despite volume declines primarily due to increases in wage rates and benefit costs and increases in facility costs 
general and administrative expenses declined due to staff reductions and the reorganization of segment operations in early depreciation and amortization increased due to investments in information systems and transportation vehicles

our visiting nurse segment revenues grew primarily due to increased patient volumes of about 
our acquisition of medlink oh accounted for approximately million of revenue growth in personal care 
a variety of other factors led to personal care revenue decreases  the most significant factor being the impact of spending reductions in the kentucky medicaid program  as described in the personal care segment discussion below 
operating income before unallocated corporate expense decreased from the same period last year primarily as a result of the visiting nurse medicare rate cut and spending reductions in the kentucky medicaid program in personal care 
unallocated corporate expenses in included approximately  consisting primarily of professional fees  related to the cost of conducting our investigation into the restatement of our financial statements as disclosed in our form k for the nine months ended december  it is possible that additional costs related to the investigation may be incurred in future periods 
interest expense in was lower than in as a result of lower interest rates and lower average borrowings 
the facility losses incurred in resulted from the sale of our building in ft 
myers  fl for a net loss of  and a leasehold improvement loss of  related to the relocation of our owensboro adc center 
our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was approximately of income before income taxes for as compared to an effective income tax rate of approximately for the lower tax rate in is primarily a result of changes in the distribution of taxable income and losses in the various state and local jurisdictions in which we operate

had that rate cut gone into effect on january  revenues for would have been lower by approximately  additionally  effective april   our medicare rates for patients served in rural areas were reduced which lowered revenues by approximately  for the year ended december  in october medicare rates were increased by 
despite the net effective rate cuts  our visiting nurse revenues grew by a net  or on admission and patient month growth of and  respectively 
we had the same number of agencies in operation in both periods 
our cost of services as a percentage of revenue was higher in than primarily due to the medicare rate cut 
cost of services per patient month was substantially unchanged as higher patient volume offset increases in professional nursing costs 
our decrease in revenue per patient month resulted primarily from the reimbursement changes described above

liquidity and capital resources revolving credit facility 
in march  we renewed our million credit facility with bank one kentucky na with a new expiration date of june  the credit facility bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus a margin ranging from to  currently dependent upon total leverage and is secured by substantially all assets and the stock of our subsidiaries 
the weighted average interest rates were and for the quarters ended december  and  respectively  and and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the interest rate in effect at december  was 
we pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused facility balance 
borrowings are available equal to the greater of a a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined or b an asset based formula  primarily based on accounts receivable 
borrowings under the facility may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development and growth of the business and other corporate purposes 
as of december  the formula permitted approximately million to be used  of which approximately million was outstanding 
additionally  an irrevocable letter of credit  totaling million  was outstanding in connection with our self insurance programs 
thus  a total of million was either outstanding or committed as of december  while an additional million was available for use 
our revolving credit facility is subject to various financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants 
under the most restrictive of our covenants  we are required to maintain minimum net worth of at least  we believe that this facility will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next year 
we will continue to evaluate additional capital  including possible debt and equity investments in us  to support a more rapid development of the business than would be possible with internal funds 
collection of cost report receivables and sale lease back 
we received million from the kentucky medicaid program in collection of three year old cost report receivables in late august in october we completed the sale lease back of our only real estate parcel and received the net proceeds of approximately million 
the sale lease back generated a deferred pre tax gain of approximately  which is being amortized against rent expense over the initial term of the lease 
the cash generated from these actions was used to reduce outstanding borrowings on the credit facility 
stock and warrant redemption 
in march  we redeemed  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
our cost of redemption totaled approximately million 
on august   we redeemed  shares of our common stock from a private investor at a total cost of approximately million 
on going stock buy back program 
in march  following the stock and warrant redemption discussed above  our board of directors authorized up to an additional million to be used to acquire shares of our common stock 
in april  we initiated a stock repurchase plan in compliance with rule b of the securities exchange act of this plan permits purchases to take place selectively from time to time in open market purchases through a broker or in privately negotiated transactions 
during the nine months ending december  a total of  shares were repurchased under this program  a total of  was expended for an average acquisition cost of 
during the year ended december  a total of  shares were repurchased for a total of  and an average acquisition cost of per share 
during the year ended december   a total of  shares were repurchased under this program  all of which were in open market purchases 
a total of  was expended on these purchases for an average acquisition cost of per share 
during the year ended december   there were no shares repurchased under this program 
cash flows key elements to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  net change in cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    discontinued operations activities    net decrease in cash and cash equivalents    year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from our current period income  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
most of the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from cost report settlements 
days sales outstanding were approximately and at december  and  respectively 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted primarily from the timing of payments 
net cash used in investing activities resulted principally from cash received from sale of assets partially offset by capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from repayments on our credit facility and payment of capital lease and debt obligations 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from our current period income  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
substantially all the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from medicare cost report settlements 
days sales outstanding were approximately and at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted primarily from a lower liability under our self insured employee health program 
this lower liability resulted from a an intentional acceleration of the claims payment process and b lower employee participation due to an increase in required employee contributions 
the decrease in other assets and liabilities is principally the result of the discontinuation and payout of the deferred compensation plan 
net cash used in investing activities resulted principally from improvements in our information systems and a cash bond of million posted in a litigation appeal  partially offset by cash received from sale of assets 
net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from repayments on our credit facility and payment of capital lease and debt obligations 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from our current period income  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
substantially all the increase in accounts receivable resulted from revenue growth 
days sales outstanding were approximately and at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted primarily from a lower liability under our self insured employee health program 
this lower liability resulted from a an intentional acceleration of the claims payment process and b lower employee participation due to an increase in required employee contributions 
net cash used in investing activities resulted principally from amounts invested in the acquisition of medlink ohio  improvements in information systems and adult day care expansion activities 
net cash used by financing activities resulted primarily from borrowings on our credit facility offset by payment of capital lease and debt obligations and repurchases of our common stock  net of proceeds from stock option exercises 
contractual obligations 
the following table provides information about the payment dates of our contractual obligations at december   excluding current liabilities except for the current portion of long term debt amounts in thousands thereafter total revolving credit facility   capital lease obligations  notes payable operating leases      total        we believe that a certain amount of debt has an appropriate place in our overall capital structure and it is not our strategy to eliminate all debt financing 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  and borrowing capacity on our bank credit facility will be sufficient to cover operating needs  future capital expenditure requirements and scheduled debt payments of miscellaneous small borrowing arrangements and capitalized leases 
in addition  it is likely that we will pursue growth from acquisitions  partnerships and other ventures that would be funded from excess cash from operations  credit available under the bank credit agreement and other financing arrangements that are normally available in the marketplace 
commitments and contingencies letter of credit 
we have an outstanding letter of credit of million at december   which benefits our third party insurer administrator for our automobile and workers compensation self insurance programs 
the amount of such insurance program letter of credit is subject to negotiation annually upon renewal and may vary in the future based upon such negotiation  our historical claims experience and expected future claims 
it is reasonable to expect that the amount of the letter of credit will increase in the future  however  we are unable to predict to what degree 
acquisition agreements 
on march  the company entered into an agreement to acquire all the assets and business operations of a medicare certified visiting nurse agency located in bradenton  florida 
the total purchase price of million will be paid million in cash at closing expected to be april  with the  balance in the form of a note payable bearing interest at due in its entirety two years after closing 
the company will fund the cash portion of the purchase price with available borrowings on its revolving credit facility 
the acquired operations generated net revenues of approximately million in the year ended december  we currently have no other obligations related to acquisition agreements 
however  we periodically seek acquisition candidates and may reasonably be expected to enter into acquisitions in the future 
general and professional liability 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we also know of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry insurance coverage for this exposure  however our deductible per claim increased from  to  effective july  and to  effective april  we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
other litigation 
franklin litigation on january  franklin capital associates lp franklin  aetna life and casualty company and aetna casualty and surety company shareholders  who at one time held approximately  shares of our common stock approximately of shares outstanding  filed suit in chancery court of williamson county  tennessee claiming unspecified damages not to exceed three million dollars in connection with registration rights they received in our acquisition of certain home health operations in february the suit alleged that we failed to use our best efforts to register the shares held by the plaintiffs as required by the merger agreement 
we settled with both aetna parties shortly before the case went to trial in february in mid trial franklin voluntarily withdrew its complaint reserving its legal rights to bring a new suit as allowed under tennessee law 
in april  franklin re filed its lawsuit 
the second trial took place in february in april the court issued a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs awarding damages of  we believe the court erred both in its finding of liability and in its determination of the amount of damages 
we are seeking appellate review of the lower court decision 
as a part of the appeal  we were required to post cash of  in an escrow account with the tennessee courts in lieu of a supersedeas appeal bond until the appeal court issues a decision 
this cash is reflected as cash held in escrow in the accompanying balance sheet and will remain in escrow until the matter reaches its ultimate resolution 
based on the advice of legal counsel  we believe that the damage award by the lower court does not create a probable loss as set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
accordingly  no provision for the damages award has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements 
should the facts and circumstances change in the future to the extent that such a loss appears probable  we would record a provision at that time 
based on the advice of legal counsel  we believe we have strong grounds for appealing the trial court s decision and we intend to vigorously pursue our appeal 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in our appeal 
the appeals court heard oral arguments in the case in february but has given no indication of when it will issue a ruling 
kentucky transportation litigation prior to july   the commonwealth of kentucky managed its medicaid transportation program internally 
effective july  the commonwealth contracted with an independent broker the broker for the management of the program in the louisville ky area 
the broker then contracted with us  among others  for the provision of transportation services to medicaid beneficiaries 
our services pursuant to the contract were limited to transportation of medicaid beneficiaries who also attended our in center adult day care programs 
the broker almost immediately began to encounter significant financial difficulties and paid us for only a small portion of the amounts due for services rendered 
on october   three of the broker s other contracted providers filed a motion with the us bankruptcy court to liquidate the broker under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
on november   the broker voluntarily chose to convert its bankruptcy status to a chapter voluntary reorganization 
on march   the broker reconverted its case to a chapter liquidation proceeding 
in may  along with a group of other affected providers  we filed suit against the commonwealth in franklin circuit court seeking payment directly from the commonwealth 
the commonwealth objected to the lawsuit on the basis of sovereign immunity since the group did not have a direct contract with the commonwealth and filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit 
in july  a hearing on the motion to dismiss was held and at the judge s request written briefs were filed before the judge would make a decision 
in august  the motion to dismiss was granted and after discussion with legal counsel  an appeal of this decision was made to the kentucky court of appeals 
on september  the appeals court affirmed the lower court s decision 
in its decision  the court indicated that we could pursue its claim at the kentucky board of claims  such a claim would be limited to  in damages 
on june  a lawsuit was filed on behalf of the bankruptcy estate against the commonwealth of kentucky 
the case alleges that the state misrepresented material facts about the contract that it signed with the transportation broker 
the suit alleges that the commonwealth intentionally under funded the contract with the bankrupt broker 
unlike the group of affected providers in the franklin circuit court proceeding discussed above  the broker did have a direct contract with the commonwealth 
as of december  and december   the broker owed us approximately  which amount is included in accounts receivable  net on the accompanying balance sheets 
based on discussions with legal counsel  we estimate that we will be able to recover approximately of the claim if the lawsuit is successful 
accordingly  we have established a collectibility reserve of approximately  against the receivable in this case 
although we currently believe we will be successful in ultimately collecting the amounts currently due us under this arrangement  there can be no assurance that such amounts will in fact be collected 
should it become evident in the future that a material amount will not be collectible  we will  at that time  record an additional provision for uncollectible accounts 
our senior credit facility agreement provides that the loss of either or both of the above litigation cases will be excluded from financial results for purposes of calculating borrowing availability or financial covenant compliance 
medicaid dependence we have a significant dependence on state medicaid reimbursement programs 
for the year ended december   approximately      and of our revenues were generated from medicaid reimbursement programs in the states of ohio  maryland  kentucky  florida  massachusetts  connecticut  indiana and alabama  respectively 
approximately of our revenues were derived from state medicaid and other government programs  most of which are currently facing significant budget issues 
the medicaid programs in each of the states in which we operate are taking actions or evaluating taking actions to control the rate of growth of medicaid expenditures 
among these actions are the following o redefining eligibility standards for medicaid coverage o redefining coverage criteria for home and community based care services o slowing payments to providers by increasing the minimum time in which payments are made o limiting reimbursement rate increases o changing regulations under which providers must operate the actions being taken and or being considered are because the number of medicaid beneficiaries and their related expenditures are growing at a faster rate than the government s revenue 
medicaid is consuming a greater percentage of the budget 
this issue is exacerbated when revenues slow in a slowing economy 
we believe that these financial issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long term prospect for medicaid funding of health care services 
additionally  we believe our services offer the lowest cost alternative to institutional care and are a part of the solution to the states medicaid financing problems 
it is possible  however  that the actions taken by the state medicaid programs in the future could have a significant unfavorable impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
health care reform the health care industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document 
proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures 
government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative cost of doing business  and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors 
legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of expenditures are expected to continue 
such future changes may further impact our reimbursement 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
federal and state legislative proposals continue to be introduced that would impose more limitations on payments to providers of health care services such as us 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures 
we cannot predict what additional government regulations may be enacted in the future affecting our business or how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted  or whether we will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in our existing or future markets 
refer to the sections on reimbursement changes and cautionary statements forward outlook and risks in part i  and the notes to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa was enacted by the federal government on august   and requires organizations to adhere to certain standards to protect data integrity  confidentiality and availability 
hipaa also mandates  among other things  that the department of health and human services adopt standards for the exchange of electronic health information in an effort to encourage overall administrative simplification and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the health care industry 
we implemented changes in our operations to comply with the privacy aspects of hipaa and we believe we are in compliance 
we do not expect the cost of complying with privacy standards to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we implemented changes in our operations to comply with the electronic transaction and code sets aspects of hipaa and we believe we are in compliance with those requirements 
independent of hipaa requirements  we have been developing new information systems with improved functionality to facilitate improved billing and collection activities  reduced administrative costs and improved decision support information 
we have incorporated the hipaa mandated electronic transaction and code sets into the design of this new software 
regulations with regard to the security components of hipaa were published in those regulations are required to be implemented by april we believe we will be in compliance with the security regulations  with no material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
discontinued operations during the year ended december   we recorded in income from discontinued operations a one time reduction in estimated tax liabilities of approximately  due to the expiration of various statutory limitations pertaining to the tax year in which we sold our product operations 
we follow the guidance in sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and  when appropriate  reclassify operating units closed  sold  or held for sale out of continuing operations and into discontinued operations for all periods presented 
several adc units closed  sold or held for sale have been reclassified in our financial statements as further explained in the notes to the financial statements 
revenues from discontinued adc units were approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and respectively 
net losses from discontinued adc units were approximately   and  in the years ended december   and respectively  and such amounts are included in net loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
in the three years ended december   no operating units in the vn or pc segments met the criteria to be reclassified as discontinued operations 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments we do not use derivative instruments 
market risk of financial instruments our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately  in annual pre tax earnings
