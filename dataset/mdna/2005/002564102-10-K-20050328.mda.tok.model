item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the company is a supplier of mainly safety related products and tools to workers involved in the construction  manufacturing and homeland security markets 
from seven fully stocked distribution facilities sales offices in the western and southwestern part of the united states the company primarily distributes commodity products to the local geographic areas surrounding its facilities 
iesi  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  imports disposable clothing from china 
iesi sells their product throughout the united states through the abatix distribution channels  as well as through other distributors 
the company s management believes that hiring additional sales staff  controlling costs  geographic expansion  diversification of customer base and responding effectively to competitive challenges are important to the long term success of the company 
sales staff we sell our products based on relationships  among other things 
our ability to hire  train and retain staff  especially in the sales and customer service area is critical to our long term success 
our current competitive compensation and benefits  including updating these items when necessary  as well as a good work life balance are critical to this area 
controlling costs to maintain our competitive position by providing competitively priced products while also maintaining our profitability  we must control our costs and effectively utilize our assets 
during we reviewed  and will continue to review in  our general and administrative costs making adjustments where appropriate 
our ability to control costs can be affected by outside factors  such as the price of oil or increases in interest rates 
in addition  the cost to comply with section of sarbanes oxley is expected to approximate  which would negate most of our cost reduction efforts to date 
geographic expansion the company needs to leverage our infrastructure and knowledge over a larger revenue base 
while the company intends to focus on growing revenues in its existing locations  the company will also explore geographic expansion 
customer base while no customer represents or more of the company s revenues  there are several large customers  especially at iesi 
the loss of one or more of those customers would have an impact on our revenue and profitability 
the company intends to pursue additional customers and cultivate current customers in an attempt to lessen the impact of any one customer 
competitive environment past results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we experience intense competition for sales of our products in all of our markets 
our competition ranges from small owner operator distributors to large national retail chains selling to the construction industry and large national companies selling to the construction and industrial industries 
typically  the smaller companies are built around very strong relationships which make it hard to penetrate  while the larger companies have a distinct geographic and price advantage

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used 
the critical judgments by management relate to excess and obsolete inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciation  amortization and impairment testing for property and equipment  and deferred tax assets and potential income tax assessments 
the company s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
excess and obsolete inventory the company evaluates whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and life of inventory 
the assumptions used in this evaluation are based on current market conditions and the company believes inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market in the financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company has estimated the net realizable value of accounts receivable by evaluating the current pool of accounts receivable in light of past experience and current knowledge of its customer base 
the company believes the reserves recorded in the financial statements are adequate for potential credit losses 
it is possible the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time or if the health of the economy  its customers or the markets served by the company deteriorates 
depreciation  amortization and impairment testing for property and equipment estimating the useful lives of property  plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment  and actual lives may differ from these estimates 
changes to these initial useful life estimates would be made if and when appropriate 
property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines and facilities  future sales volumes  growth rates for selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
the company makes estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows from the use of long lived assets in assessing potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
since there were no events or changes in circumstances to indicate the carrying value of long lived assets were impaired  the company recorded no adjustment to the carrying value of these assets 
the company does not expect events or circumstances to significantly change  thereby affecting the carrying value of long lived assets 
deferred tax assets and potential income tax assessments as of december   the company has recorded a net deferred tax asset 
in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets  if any  the company considers many factors  including the specific taxing jurisdiction  income tax strategies and forecasted earnings 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  the company concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company records liabilities in current income taxes for potential assessments resulting from tax audits 
any accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in  potentially  a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the ultimate resolution of these positions 
these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws  rulings by tax authorities  or the expiration of the statute of limitations

business outlook our goal for is to produce revenue growth  exclusive of the non recurring revenues in florida in  as it is vital to our long term success 
we are anticipating some improvement in the industrial manufacturing and construction markets as the general economy and  in particular  the real estate market  continue to improve 
we anticipate growth in the environmental market  and in particular  the restoration subset of that market 
year over year growth will be difficult when the positive impact of the florida hurricanes is included in the homeland security segment is expected to continue to grow in the growth in this market to date has been with the public sector and generally is at lower margins than the remainder of the company s markets 
we are hopeful the private sector will spend more money on homeland security products as general economic conditions improve  however  there is not much evidence to support the private sector will begin to spend on our homeland security products 
in response to these issues  the company has lowered its cost structure to support this market 
hiring of additional sales staff will be critical for long term growth of the company 
diversification of our customer base  especially at the iesi segment  will also help provide more consistent results 
although no customers are more than of our revenues  we have several large customers  the loss of which would impact our sales and profitability 
the growth at the iesi segment was primarily generated by three customers 
we are focused on helping all of our customers grow  as well as adding to our customer base 
new locations and acquisitions will most likely be critical for the long term growth of the company 
although we are not certain if and when we will open new locations  we are currently evaluating certain markets as possibilities 
we are not currently evaluating any acquisitions 
overall margins for are anticipated to remain at their current levels 
we are utilizing certain tools and reporting from our new computer system in an effort to enhance margins 
in addition  these tools and reporting should allow us to identify issues that can be addressed more quickly  thereby minimizing possible margin erosion 
we are evaluating the consolidation of certain vendors to gain access to better pricing 
we are evaluating alternative sourcing vehicles to enhance our purchasing process 
however  further competitive pressures or changes in the customer or product mix could negatively impact any and all efforts by the company to maintain or improve product margins 
the company will need to further reduce costs to stay competitive and improve on its profitability 
we intend to continue evaluating costs  including labor related costs  rent and freight which make up approximately of our selling  general and administrative costs  to ensure our cost structure is in line with our revenue stream and supports our business model 
unless revenues improve significantly and are sustainable  s  g a expenses are estimated to remain in their current range for the company s credit facilities are variable rate notes tied to the lending institution s prime rate 
increases in the prime rate could negatively affect the company s earnings 
depending on many factors  including the timing of sales  cash flow from operations for the entire year of is expected to be positive as the company collects the receivables from the sales increase in the last half of  improvements are made to inventory and purchasing and there is further refinement in our cost structure 
unless the company employs a more aggressive growth strategy  management believes the company s current credit facilities  together with cash provided by operations  will be sufficient for its capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
the company s accounts receivable collection days have leveled off over the past twelve months after increasing slightly in the eighteen months prior 
the increase was primarily a result of the sharp decrease in sales to restoration contractors 
the company took steps to protect our interests in certain receivables and believes its allowance for bad debts is sufficient to cover any anticipated losses 
the company s inventory turns have also leveled off over the past twelve months after declining the eighteen months prior 
the decline was primarily a result of the sharp decrease in sales to restoration contractors and the increase in inventory to support a customer 
sales to this customer have improved  but have been slow to reach the projected levels 
a new location would require approximately  in fixed asset purchases  comprised of computers  office furniture  warehouse racking and potentially a delivery vehicle 
in addition  cash will also be required to stock this location with product and to finance the customers purchases 
cash flow from operations and borrowings on our lines of credit will be used to finance any new location 
unless the company s stock could be used as currency  any acquisitions would most likely require the raising of capital as the borrowing capacity on the lines of credit and the cash flow from operations would most likely not be sufficient to support an acquisition of reasonable size 
the company currently estimates that it will incur approximately  in additional costs related to the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of these costs will be incurred over and information concerning forward looking statements certain statements contained herein  among other things  are of a forward looking nature relating to future events or the future business performance of abatix 
such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  global  national and local economic and political conditions  changes in laws and regulations relating to the company s products and the import of such products  the outcome of litigation  market acceptance of new products  existence or development of competitive products the company represents as a distributor that outperform current product lines or are priced more competitively  inability to hire and train quality people or retain current employees  changes in interest rates  the financial status of key customers and vendors  efforts to control and or reduce costs  adverse weather conditions  significant changes in oil prices  or the company s success in the process of management s assessment and auditor attestation of internal controls  as required by the sarbanes oxley act of we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as required by law or regulation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since the company s working capital and equipment lines of credit are variable rate notes  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
based on the company s debt at december  and  an increase of basis points in the united states prime rate would have negatively impacted the company s net earnings for the years then ended by  and  respectively
