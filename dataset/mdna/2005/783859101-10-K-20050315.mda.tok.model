management believes that if a downturn in the local residential real estate market occurs  the impact of declining values on the real estate loan portfolio will be mitigated because of s t s conservative mortgage lending policies for portfolio loans  which generally require a maximum term of years for fixed rate mortgages  a maximum term of years for adjustable rate mortgages and private mortgage insurance for loans with less than a percent down payment

problem loans are identified and continually monitored through detailed reviews of specific commercial loans  and the analysis of delinquency and charge off levels of consumer loan portfolios 
charged off and recovered loan amounts are applied to the allowance for loan losses 
monthly updates are presented to the s t board of directors as to the status of loan quality 
page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts are added to the allowance for loan losses through a charge to current earnings through the provision for loan losses  based upon management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for probable loan losses 
a quantitative analysis is utilized to support the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this analysis includes review of the historical charge off rates for all loan categories  fluctuations and trends in various risk factors 
factors consider the level of s t s historical charge offs that have occurred within the credits economic life cycle 
management also assesses qualitative factors such as portfolio credit trends  unemployment trends  vacancy trends  peer loss trends  loan growth and variable interest rate factors 
significant to this analysis and assessment is the shift in loan portfolio composition to an increased mix of commercial loans 
these loans are generally larger in size and  due to our continuing growth  many are not well seasoned and could be more vulnerable to an economic slowdown 
management relies on its risk rating process to monitor trends  which may be occurring relative to commercial loans to assess potential weaknesses within specific credits 
current risk factors  trends in risk ratings and historical charge off experiences are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
during  the risk rating profile of the portfolio remained relatively stable 
management believes its quantitative and qualitative analysis and risk rating process is sufficient and enables it to conclude that the total allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established based on management s assessment of the factors noted above along with the growth in the loan portfolio 
the additions to the allowance charged to operating expense has maintained the allowance as a percent of loans at the following levels at the end of each year presented below year ended december s t has considered impaired loans in its determination of the allowance for loan losses

the other was a commercial loan relationship  partially charged off in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a million recovery through the sale of collateral 
no additional exposure remains for either of these loan relationships 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans excluding these items was percent consistent with historical levels 
the balance of nonperforming loans  which include nonaccrual loans past due days or more  at december   was million or percent of total loans 
this compares to nonperforming loans of million or percent of total loans at december  other real estate owned decreased slightly by million in to million 
the following table summarizes s t s nonaccrual and past due loans december dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans accruing loans past due days or more it is s t s policy to place loans in all categories on non accrual status when collection of interest or principal is doubtful  or generally when interest or principal payments are days or more past due 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when the loan is days past due or  in management s opinion  the account should be placed on nonaccrual status

there are no foreign loan amounts required to be included in this table 
there were no restructured loans in the periods presented

special rate deposits of  and over were percent and percent of total deposits at december  and  respectively  and primarily represent deposit relationships with local customers in our market area 
in addition  s t has the ability to access both public and private markets to raise long term funding if necessary 
at december   there were million of brokered retail certificates of deposit outstanding compared to million at december  the purchase of brokered retail certificates of deposits was an alco strategy to increase liquidity for commercial loan demand  as an alternative to increased borrowings  and to better align interest rate risks in an asset sensitive balance sheet 
borrowings average borrowings increased million in and were comprised of securities sold under repurchase agreements repos  federal funds purchased  fhlb advances and long term borrowings at the fhlb 
s t defines repos with its retail customers as retail repos  wholesale repos are those transacted with other banks and brokerage firms with terms normally ranging from one to days 
the average balance in retail repos increased by million in and decreased by million in s t views retail repos as a relatively stable source of funds because most of these accounts are with local  long term customers 
wholesale repos  federal funds purchased and fhlb advances averaged million in  an increase of million from the averages 
the increase was made in order to take advantage of low rate short term funds and to better match commercial borrower shifts into more variable rate products 
during  average fixed rate borrowings decreased million 
at december   s t had long term borrowings outstanding of million at a fixed rate with the fhlb and million of long term repurchase agreement borrowings 
the purpose of these borrowings was to provide matched fundings for newly originated loans  to mitigate the risk associated with volatile liability fundings  to take advantage of lower cost funds through the fhlb s community investment program and to fund stock buy backs 
during the fourth quarter of  s t prepaid million of fixed rate borrowings  with average maturities of approximately nine months and an average cost of percent  resulting in a pretax prepayment charge of million 
the prepayment penalties are reflected in s t s consolidated statements of income as noninterest expense 
the funds were replaced with short term borrowings having an average cost of percent 
the expense savings approximated million in and million in the reduction in higher cost long term debt was an alco strategy intended to mitigate the asset sensitivity position of s t s balance sheet and exposure to declining interest rates or a flattening yield curve

the increase is attributable to increased performance in the stock markets and newly developed business relationships 
explanation of use of non gaap financial measures in addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  s t management uses  and this annual report contains or references  certain non gaap financial measures  such as net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis and operating revenue 
s t believes these non gaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance and our business and performance trends  as they facilitate comparisons with the performance of others in the financial services industry 
although s t believes that these non gaap financial measures enhance investors understanding of s t s business and performance  these non gaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to gaap 
s t believes the presentation of net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis is reconciled to net interest income in the table on page operating revenue is the sum of net interest income and noninterest income less security gains 
in order to understand the significance of net interest income to s t business and operating results  s t management believes it is appropriate to evaluate the significance of net interest income as a component of operating revenue 
results of operations year ended december  net income net income was a record million or per diluted earnings per share in  a percent increase from the million or per diluted earnings per share in the increase in earnings was primarily the result of increases in net interest income and lower provision for loan losses  offset by lower security gains 
the return on average assets was percent for  as compared to percent for the return on average equity at percent for compared to percent for page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued return on equity and assets the table below shows consolidated operating and capital ratios of s t for each of the last three years year ended december return on average assets return on average equity dividend payout ratio equity to asset ratio net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income increased million or percent for compared to the net yield on interest earning assets decreased to percent in as compared to percent in the decline in net interest margin is primarily due to significant loan refinancing activities and the shift of customer preferences for lower rate variable loans during a period of historically low interest rates 
this effect on net interest income was offset by higher earning asset volumes  the growth in core deposits and the replacement of some fixed rate borrowings with short term borrowings 
in  average loans increased million and average securities decreased million 
the yields on average loans decreased by basis points and the yields on average securities decreased basis points 
overall funding costs decreased basis points 
average interest bearing deposits provided million of the funds for the growth in average earning assets  at a cost of percent in as compared to percent in the cost of repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds decreased basis points to percent 
positively affecting net interest income was a million increase in average net free funds during compared to average net free funds are the excess of demand deposits  other noninterest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity over nonearning assets 
most of this increase is due to the successful marketing of new demand accounts and corporate cash management services 
maintaining consistent spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is very significant to s t s financial performance because net interest income comprised percent of operating revenue  net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding security gains in and the level and mix of earning assets and funds are continually monitored by alco in order to mitigate the interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risks of the balance sheet 
a variety of alco strategies were successfully implemented  within prescribed alco risk parameters  that enabled s t to maintain a net interest margin consistent with historical levels 
net interest income represents the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest yields and rates 
interest on loans to and obligations of state  municipalities and other public entities is not subject to federal income tax 
as such  the stated pre tax yield on these assets is lower than the yields on taxable assets of similar risk and maturity 
in order to make the pre tax income and resultant yields comparable to taxable loans and investments  a taxable equivalent adjustment was added to interest income in the tables below 
this adjustment has been calculated using the us federal statutory corporate income tax rate of percent for  and the following table demonstrates the amount that has been added to interest income per the summary of operations year ended december dollars in thousands interest income per consolidated statements of income adjustment to fully taxable equivalent basis interest income adjusted to fully taxable equivalent basis interest expense net interest income adjusted to fully taxable equivalent basis page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued average balance sheet and net interest income analysis december average balance interest yield rate average balance interest yield rate average balance interest yield rate dollars in thousands assets loans  taxable investment securities tax exempt investment securities interest earning deposits with banks federal funds sold total interest earning assets noninterest earning assets cash and due from banks premises and equipment  net other assets less allowance for loan losses total liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing liabilities now money market accounts savings deposits time deposits short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase long term borrowings total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing liabilities demand deposits other shareholders equity total net interest income net yield on interest earning assets for the purpose of these computations  nonaccruing loans are included in the daily average loan amounts outstanding 
tax exempt income is on a fully tax equivalent basis  including the dividend received deduction for equity securities  using the statutory federal corporate income tax rate of percent for  and yields are calculated using historical cost basis

the provision for loan losses was million and million for and  respectively 
the provision is the result of management s assessment of credit quality statistics and other risk factors that would have an impact on probable losses in the loan portfolio  and the model used for determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
changes in the provision and allowance for loan losses are directionally consistent with changes in credit quality and other risk factors 
credit quality is the most important factor in determining the amount of the allowance  and the resulting  provision 
also affecting the amount of the allowance and resulting provision is loan growth and portfolio composition 
most of the loan growth in and is attributable to larger sized commercial loans 
net loan charge offs totaled million for and million in included in the net charge offs is the aforementioned million recovery in the fourth quarter of of two previously charged off loans that were considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses

critical accounting policies and judgements s t has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these policies are described in note a accounting policies 
certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect s t s reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on s t s future financial condition and results of operations 
securities securities are reported at cost adjusted for premiums and discounts and are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity 
declines in fair value of individual securities below their amortized cost and that are other than temporary will be written down to current market value and included in earnings as realized losses 
management systematically evaluates securities for other than temporary declines in fair value on a quarterly basis 
if the financial markets experience deterioration  additional charges to income could occur in future periods 
allowance for loan losses determination of an adequate allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective  as it requires estimations of occurrence of future events as well as timing of such events 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 
s t s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined by management through evaluation of the loss exposure on individual nonperforming  delinquent and high dollar loans  review of economic conditions and business trends  historical loss experience  and growth and composition of the loan portfolio  as well as other relevant factors 
a quantitative analysis is utilized to support the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this analysis includes review of the historical charge offs that have occurrence within the credits economic life cycle 
management also assesses qualitative factors such as portfolio credit trends  unemployment trends  vacancy trends  peer loss trends  loan growth and variable interest rate factors 
page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued significant to this analysis is the shift in loan portfolio composition to an increased mix of commercial loans 
these loans are generally larger in size  and  due to our continuing growth  many are new loan relationships 
management relies on its risk rating process to monitor trends that may be occurring relative to commercial loans to assess potential weaknesses within the credit 
current risk factors and trends in risk ratings are considered in the determination and allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
during  the risk rating profile of the portfolio remained relatively stable 
the allowance for loan losses at december  includes million or percent of the allowance allocated to commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans 
the ability for customers to repay commercial loans is more dependent upon the success of their business  continuing income and general economic conditions 
accordingly  the risk of loss is higher on such loans than on residential real estate loans  which generally incur lower losses in the event of foreclosure as the collateral value typically exceeds the loan amounts 
goodwill and other intangible assets s t has million of core deposit intangible assets subject to amortization and million in goodwill  which is not subject to periodic amortization 
s t determined the amount of identifiable intangible assets based upon an independent core deposit analysis and insurance contract analysis 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
s t s goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon s t s ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of free competition from other market participants on a regional basis 
this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features and the ease of use of s t s services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment is performed by s t 
the fair value of s t and the implied fair value of goodwill at the respective reporting unit level are estimated using industry comparable information 
s t has concluded that the recorded value of goodwill was not impaired as a result of the evaluation as of september  inflation management is aware of the significant effect inflation has on interest rates and can have on financial performance 
s t s ability to cope with this is best determined by analyzing its capability to respond to changing interest rates and its ability to manage noninterest income and expense 
s t monitors its mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities through alco in order to reduce the impact of inflation on net interest income 
management also controls the effects of inflation by reviewing the prices of its products and services  by introducing new products and services and by controlling overhead expenses 
business uncertainties there are many uncertainties regarding the economy as we enter s t strives to be well positioned for changes in both the economy and interest rates  regardless of the timing or direction of these changes 
the balance sheet  capital  liquidity and operation infrastructures are continually assessed in order to be positioned to take advantage of internal or acquisition growth opportunities 
there are many factors that could influence our results  both positively and negatively  in because the majority of revenue comes from the net interest margin  internally generated loan and deposit growth and the mix of that growth are major factors 
s t has directed a fair amount of focus and resources in planning for this year to improve the generation and retention of low cost core deposits 
on the other hand  a slowing economy could cause deterioration in the asset quality measurements  we recognize that the shift to a greater dependence on commercial loans in recent years exposes s t to larger credit risks and greater swings in nonperforming loans and charge offs when problems do occur 
however  because of s t s adequate allowance for loan losses  earnings strength and strong capitalization  as well as the strengths of other businesses in our market area  management does not expect a decline in s t s ability to satisfactorily perform if a further decline in our e conomy occurs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity refers to the ability to satisfy the financial needs of depositors who want to withdraw funds  or of borrowers needing access to funds to meet their credit needs 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
alco is responsible for establishing and monitoring the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity guidelines  procedures and policies 
the principal sources of asset liquidity are cash and due from banks  interest earning deposits with banks  federal funds  investment securities that mature in one year or less and securities available for sale 
at december   the total of such assets was approximately million or percent of consolidated assets 
while much more difficult to quantify  liability liquidity is further enhanced by a stable core deposit base  access to credit lines at other financial institutions and s t s ability to renew maturing deposits 
certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more represented percent of deposits at december  and were outstanding primarily to local customers 
s t s ability to attract deposits and borrow funds depends primarily on continued rate competitiveness  profitability  capitalization and overall financial condition 
beyond the issue of having sufficient sources to fund unexpected credit demands or deposit withdrawals  liquidity management also is an important factor in monitoring and managing interest rate sensitivity issues through alco 
through forecast and simulation models  alco is also able to project future funding needs and develop strategies for acquiring funds at a reasonable cost 
alco uses a variety of measurements to monitor the liquidity position of s t 
these include liquidity gap  liquidity forecast  net loans and standby letters of credit to assets  net loans to deposits and net non core funding dependence ratio 
because the assets and liabilities of s t are primarily monetary in nature  the presentation and analysis of cash flows in formats prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are less meaningful for managing bank liquidity than for non financial companies 
funds are typically provided from current earnings  maturity and sales of securities available for sale  loan repayments  deposits and borrowings 
the primary uses of funds include new loans  repayment of borrowings  the purchase of securities and dividends to shareholders 
the level and mix of sources and uses of funds are constantly monitored and adjusted by alco in order to maintain credit  liquidity and interest rate risks within prescribed policy guidelines while maximizing earnings 
alco monitors and manages interest rate sensitivity through gap  rate shock analysis  simulation and economic value of equity analyses in order to avoid unacceptable earnings fluctuations due to interest rate changes 
s t s gap model includes certain management assumptions based upon past experience and the expected behavior of customers during various assumed interest rate scenarios 
the assumptions include principal prepayments for mortgages  installment loans and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  and classifying the demand  savings and money market balances by degree of interest rate sensitivity 
in addition to the gap analysis  s t performs an earnings sensitivity analysis to identify more dynamic interest rate risk exposures 
an earnings simulation model is used to estimate the effect that specific interest rate changes would have on months of pretax earnings 
the model incorporates management assumptions regarding the level of interest rate or balance changes on indeterminate maturity deposit products savings  money market  now and demand deposits for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior 
derivative financial instruments are included in this process 
interest rate caps and floors on all products are included to the extent that they become effective in the month simulation period 
also  changes in prepayment behavior of the residential mortgage portfolio in each rate environment are captured using management estimates 
finally  the impact of planned growth and anticipated new business activities is factored into the simulation model 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s t s policy objective is to limit the decline in annual pretax net interest income to million or percent from an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates of basis points 
due to low interest rates which  include federal funds at percent  the earnings sensitivity analysis does not assume a parallel change in interest rates in the basis points rate reduction scenarios for financial instruments 
as of december  and  respectively  s t had the following estimated earnings sensitivity profile immediate change in rates dollars in millions rates up rates down pretax earnings change bps pretax earnings change bps the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventory 
fluctuations in interest rates and the efforts of the federal reserve board to regulate money and credit have a greater effect on a financial institution s profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services 
through its alco  s t is positioned to cope with changing interest rates and inflationary trends 
alco monitors and manages interest rate sensitivity through gap  simulation and duration analysis 
the schedule below presents s t s interest rate sensitivity at december  using gap analysis 
the gap and cumulative gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods  as measured by a ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities 
alco policy guidelines for cumulative gap in the six and month time frames  annually approved by the s t board of directors  is currently a range of percent to percent 
management believes this range provides an acceptable and manageable level of interest rate risk for s t 
significant to gap analysis is the expected rate of asset prepayment  calls on securities and the behavior of depositors during periods of changing interest rates 
for example  in periods of declining interest rates  borrowers can be expected to accelerate loan prepayments and refinancing  depositors will tend to hold those certificates of deposits with rates higher than the then current mark et rate 
conversely  in a rising interest rate scenario  borrower refinancing and prepayments typically decrease  while deposit shifting and early withdrawals tend to accelerate as depositors position funds to earn higher yields 
alco continually monitors these historical behavior patterns through periods of changing interest rates  and uses this information to develop loan prepayments and decay rates for core deposits demand  now  savings 
the gap analysis below incorporates a flat rate scenario  and the following significant assumptions monthly loan prepayments above contractual requirements year arm commercial real estate year arm commercial real estate fixed rate commercial real estate residential real estate other installment loans deposit behavioral pattern decay rate assumptions now and savings year now and savings year now and savings beyond year greenplan savings months money market months s t has not historically experienced fluctuations in demand deposit balances during periods of interest rate fluctuations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity  december  gap months months months years dollars in thousands repricing assets cash due from banks securities net loans other assets total repricing liabilities demand now money market savings clubs greenplan savings certificates repos short term borrowings long term borrowings swaps other liabilities equity total gap cumulative gap rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities current month policy guideline immediate core deposit repricing cumulative months cumulative months s t s one year gap position at december  is asset sensitive 
asset sensitive means that more assets than liabilities of s t will reprice during the measured timeframes 
the implications of an asset sensitive position will differ depending upon the current trend of market interest rates 
for example  with an asset sensitive position in a declining interest rate environment  the cost of s t repricing assets can theoretically be expected to decline more quickly than the yields on s t repricing liabilities 
this situation would cause a decrease to s t s interest rate spreads  net interest income and to operating income 
liquidity impacts in this scenario  other than increased costs  would not be material unless serious ongoing declines in operating results caused depositors  lenders and investors to lose confidence 
conversely  an asset sensitive gap position in a rising interest rate scenario would theoretically have a positive impact to interest rate spreads  net income and to operating income 
liquidity impacts would not be material in the short term  in the long term  improved operating income is always beneficial to liquidity issues
