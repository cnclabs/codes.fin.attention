item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the following section presents management s review of the financial condition and operating results of vail banks  inc and its subsidiary  weststar bank  collectively vail banks or the company 
it is intended to assist readers in evaluating vail banks performance 
certain reclassifications have been made to previous periods information to conform to the presentation 
the following analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as well as the selected financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the securities and exchange commission has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on these criteria  management has identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments 
although management believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses calculation process has two components 
the first component represents the allowance for impaired loans computed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas component  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures an amendment of fasb statement no 
to determine the sfas component  collateral dependent impaired loans are evaluated using internal analyses as well as third party information  such as appraisals 
if an impaired loan is unsecured  it is evaluated using a discounted cash flow of the payments expected over the life of the loan giving consideration to currently existing factors that would impact the amount or timing of the cash flows 
the second component is the allowance calculated under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas component  and represents the estimated probable but undetected losses inherent within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information about a borrower s financial condition  delinquent loans that have not been determined to be impaired  trends in speculative construction real estate lending  results of internal and external loan reviews  and other factors 
this component of the allowance is calculated by assigning a certain risk weighting  within a predetermined range  to each identified risk factor 
management has an internal goal to maintain the allowance for loan losses between and of average gross loans 
the recorded allowance is the aggregate of the sfas and sfas components 
at december   the company had a million allowance for loan losses 
management believes that this allowance is adequate to cover probable losses based on all currently available evidence 
future additions to the allowance may be required based on management s continuing evaluation of the inherent risks in the portfolio 
additional provisions for loan losses may need to be recorded if the economy declines  asset quality deteriorates  or historical loss experience changes 
also  state or federal regulators  when reviewing vail banks loan portfolio in the future  may require vail banks to increase the allowance 
any increase in the allowance would adversely affect vail banks earnings 
an analysis of the allowance for loan losses as well as its allocation among certain categories of the loan portfolio can be found in the financial condition section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  management may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires the company to assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step is a screen for impairment  and the second step measures the amount of any impairment 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
the company also performed an annual impairment test of other intangible assets  comprised of core deposit premium  for the fourth quarter of and determined that the other intangible assets were not impaired 
certain factors affecting forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements about our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions and other statements contained in this report that are not historical facts 
when used in this report  the words expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are inherently subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  these forward looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change 
actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth below 
vail banks does not intend to update any forward looking statements whether written or oral  relating to matters discussed in this annual report on form k 
financial overview net income was million in  an increase of approximately million from the  earned in the growth was primarily due to a reduction in non interest expenses of million  or  from million in to million in  and a million gain  pre tax  on the sale of the company s vail bank building 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in mortgage broker fee income 
these results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future years 
without the gain on sale of the building  net income for the year ended december  would have been million 
in  the company had a million  or  decrease in net income from million in to  this decrease was primarily due to reduced loan volumes and falling interest rates  leading to a decrease in the net interest margin to from in  and an increase in non interest expense of million  or  to million from million in also contributing to the decrease in net income was a million write off of premises and equipment 
the return on average assets was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the return on average equity was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  assets increased by million  or  to million during this increase was primarily due to growth in loans and investment securities of million offset by a decrease in cash equivalents of million 
assets increased by million  or  to million during this increase was primarily due to an increase in cash  cash equivalents and investment securities of million  offset by a decrease in loans held for sale generated by first western of million and a decrease in gross loans of million 
results of operations net interest income net interest income continues to be vail banks principal source of income  representing the difference between interest and fees earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
in this discussion  net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis fte includes tax exempt income  such as interest on securities of states and municipalities  increased to an amount that would have been earned had such income been taxable 
this adjustment places taxable and nontaxable income on a common basis and permits comparisons of rates and yields 
the following table sets forth the average balances  interest income and expense  and average yields and rates for vail banks earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated on a fully tax equivalent basis

interest income on loans includes loan fees of million  million  and million in   and respectively 
fte margin has been computed by dividing fte net interest income by total earning assets 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest yields and rates on those assets and liabilities 
an analysis of how changes in volume and yields and rates affected net interest income for the years ended december   and is presented below 
analysis of changes in net interest income over over volume yield rate total volume yield rate total in thousands interest income federal funds sold and other short term investments investment securities taxable  tax exempt  loans      investment in trust i and trust ii total interest income    interest expense interest bearing transaction accounts certificates of deposit  securities sold under agreements to repurchase short term borrowings long term borrowings trust preferred   subordinated notes to trust i and trust ii   total interest expense     change in net interest income fte     fully taxable equivalent fte 
notes the change in interest that cannot be attributed to only a change in rate or a change in volume  but instead represents a combination of the two factors  has been allocated to the rate variance 
fte net interest income increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the net interest margin on an fte basis was for as compared to for net interest margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and non interest bearing liabilities as well as the cost of interest bearing liabilities as compared to the yield on earning assets 
the increase in net interest margin during was primarily due to a million increase in average loan volumes since december  as a result of a strong economy and an internal focus on growing our loan portfolio 
the company s average yield on loans dropped basis points to during from during  due to competitive market pressures  despite increases made by the federal reserve 
however  the increase in loan volume surpassed the decrease in average yields  to contribute  to the million increase in net interest income 
as a result of the adoption of fin r in january  trust i and trust ii are no longer consolidated into the company s financial results 
accordingly  the and financial statements include the million of trust preferred securities and million of related interest expense 
for  the financial statements include the company s  investment in the trusts  the million of subordinated debentures issued by the company to the trusts  and the million of related interest expense 
fte interest income increased  or for as compared to primarily due to an increase in loan volume and taxable investment securities volume 
loans had a yield of during compared to during during  average loans increased to of total earning assets as compared to during similarly  the average taxable investment securities increased to of total earning assets as compared to during as a result of these changes  the total yield on average earning assets decreased basis points to for  as compared to for interest expense decreased  or for as compared to primarily due to a decrease in the average rate on interest bearing deposits  which decreased basis points to for  as compared to for this caused a decline in interest expense of  the average balance in interest bearing deposits increased million in to million  compared to million in long term borrowings decreased in volume contributing to a decline in interest expense despite the basis point increase in average yield 
the average balance in long term borrowings decreased million in to million  compared to million in fte net interest income decreased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the net interest margin on an fte basis was for as compared to for the decrease in net interest margin during was primarily due to a million decrease in average loan volumes since december  as a result of the soft economy  more conservative underwriting policies  and a temporary internal focus on resolving problem loans 
this resulted in additional liquidity that the company used to purchase lower yielding investments and to sell federal funds 
at the same time  the company capitalized on the low interest rate environment and its wholesale funding source to extend fixed rate financing to several customers  thereby locking in a spread 
these borrowings came at a higher interest cost than deposits 
also contributing to the decrease in net interest margin was the basis point interest rate cut implemented by the federal reserve during second quarter and the basis point cut during november finally  the company deferred more loan fees during compared with during  the company deferred  in loan fees versus  in  reflecting a more conservative approach that more closely recognizes loan fee income over the lives of the related loans 
a portion of the deferral also included fees on long term loans now being funded with long term borrowings  a substantial portion of which will be recognized as income in subsequent quarters 
fte interest income decreased million  or for as compared to despite the fact that earning assets increased million or during the same period 
during  the mix of earning assets continued to shift away from loans and toward lower yielding investment securities and federal funds sold 
loans had a yield of during as compared to the yield on investment securities and yield on federal funds sold 
during  average loans declined to of earning assets as compared to during as a result of this shift  the total yield on average earnings assets decreased basis points to for  as compared to for interest expense increased  or for as compared to primarily due to an increase in interest bearing liabilities of million during this same period 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities during this period  however  decreased basis points from during to for this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits from during as compared to during the basis point interest rate cut implemented by the federal reserve during second quarter and the basis point cut during november contributed to this lower cost 
provision for loan losses the amount of the provision for loan losses is based on regular evaluations of the loan portfolio  with particular attention directed toward non performing  delinquent  and other potential problem loans 
during these evaluations  consideration is also given to such factors as management s evaluation of specific loans  the level and composition of delinquent and non performing loans  historical loan loss experience  results of examinations by regulatory agencies  external and internal asset review processes  the market value of collateral  the strength and availability of guarantees  concentrations of credit and other judgmental factors 
the provision for loan losses was  in  compared to  in and  in the allowance for loan losses of million as of december  increased from million as of december  and represents of total loans and  of non performing loans as of december  as compared to and  respectively  at december  the company believes that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses 
during  average loans increased million  or  and non performing loans decreased million  or 
net charge offs during were  compared to  during overall  the allowance for loan losses increased  during compared to a net decrease of  during and a net decrease of  in non interest income the following table sets forth vail banks non interest income for the years indicated 
in thousands mortgage broker fees    service charges on deposits    gain on sale of premises and equipment  other fee income    rental income gain on sale of foreclosed properties other total non interest income    non interest income decreased  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage broker fee income as refinancing activity slowed during service charges on deposits decreased  or  primarily due to a decline in the number of insufficient funds charges 
rental income declined during due to the sale of the vail building and vacancies in rental properties owned by the company 
the gain on sale of foreclosed properties declined due to a decline in the number of foreclosed properties 
these decreases were partially offset by the million gain on the sale of the vail bank building 
non interest income decreased  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other fee income and service charges on deposits 
other fee income decreased  or  from primarily due to the outsourcing of the company s merchant card program 
during  service charges on deposits decreased  or due primarily to a decline in the number of insufficient funds charges 
rental income decreased during due to several tenant vacancies in rental properties owned by the company 
non interest expense the following table sets forth vail banks non interest expense for the years indicated 
in thousands salaries and employee benefits    occupancy    furniture and equipment    professional fees  marketing and promotions banking service fees retail banking telephone and data communications loss on sale of securities supplies and printing postage and freight litigation settlement amortization of intangible assets loss on sale  disposal or write off of premises and equipment other  total non interest expense    total non interest expense decreased million during  or  from million in to million in the decrease is primarily due to the write off of premises and equipment  which was in compared to million in  and decreases in salaries and employee benefits and amortization expense on intangible assets 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in marketing and promotion costs primarily due to the opening of new offices and an increased focus on deposit and loan growth 
total non interest expense increased million during  or  from million in the increase is primarily due to the write off of premises and equipment  and increases in salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expense  amortization expense on intangible assets  the opening of a de novo office in denver during the third quarter and the settlement of litigation 
these increases were partially offset by the reduction in retail banking expenses and the company s concerted efforts to reduce operational costs such as postage  supplies and professional fees 
during  the company scrutinized its premises and equipment listing and determined that certain premises and equipment were no longer required for the efficient operation of the company 
these premises and equipment were written off during the fourth quarter of resulting in a pre tax charge to income of million salaries and employee benefits expense decreased million during  or from this decrease is primarily due to a  decrease in mortgage incentive pay as a result of lower mortgage origination volumes  a  decrease in employee insurance costs primarily due to favorable healthcare claim volumes  partially offset by  increase in salaries and employee benefit expense attributable to a full year of costs for the new denver tech center office which opened during the third quarter of and  increase in salaries and employee expense attributable to the new stapleton office that opened during the third quarter of additionally  stock based compensation expense decreased  in during  the company recognized compensation expense of  related to grants of restricted stock 
additionally  an officer of the company terminated employment during and all of their restricted stock and stock options became fully vested as of december   resulting in  of additional compensation expense 
finally  during the company accelerated the stock option vesting of a former officer of the company and recognized additional compensation expense of  expenses associated with furniture and equipment decreased  in due in part to the fourth quarter write off of  of obsolete assets  which decreased depreciation expense in occupancy expenses decreased in  or 
the overall decrease is comprised of the following decrease of  for offices closed in  decrease of  due to decreased depreciation expense in as a result of the million write off of obsolete assets during the fourth quarter of  partially offset by  increase in rent for the vail office as the building was sold and then the office premises were leased back in march of   increase attributable to the new stapleton office opened during the third quarter  an additional  attributable to an expansion of the avon office  an additional  attributable to the new denver tech office opened during the third quarter and  increase attributable to the relocation of vail banks executive offices during june prior to june  the executive offices were located in a company owned facility  so no rent expense was incurred 
amortization of intangible assets decreased in by  or from primarily due to the impairment of intangible assets of  recognized in  while no impairment was recognized in the company performed its annual impairment test of other intangible assets for the fourth quarter of and concluded that no impairment charge was necessary 
however  in  due to the attrition of acquired deposit accounts the company determined that  of core deposit premium created by former acquisitions was determined to be impaired and recorded this amount as additional amortization expense during retail banking expenses remained consistent with  decreasing only  or during litigation settlements decreased  or in during  the company settled three cases at a cost of  during third quarter  the company settled a lawsuit at a cost of  the lawsuit resulted from actions taken by a former officer at an acquired bank prior to the company s acquisition of such bank 
during the fourth quarter  the company sold million of investment securities taking a pre tax loss of  the purpose of the sale was to increase the company s funding to support the significant loan growth experienced during the efficiency ratio represents non interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income and non interest income and is a measure of the cost to generate a dollar of revenue 
the efficiency ratio improved in to from in it was in the improvement in was primarily due to an increase in revenue and the decrease in non interest expense discussed above 
the increase in over was primarily due to the decline in revenue net interest income plus non interest income of million over while non interest expenses increased million during the same period 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income was for compared with and for and  respectively 
in  taxable income increased  primarily from loan growth  causing an increase in income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income 
during  the company had a significant increase in tax exempt interest income as a percentage of total income as a result of municipal bond purchases and the reduced level of total income 
this reduction in current income tax expense was offset by additional deferred tax expense associated with the adjustment of the tax bases of certain premises and equipment 
a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this annual report on form k 
financial condition investments at december   the carrying value of investment securities was million  an increase of million  or  over million at december  due to a concerted effort to improve yields by investing excess cash in available for sale securities 
at december   the carrying value of investment securities was million  which was an increase of million  or  over million at december  during this period  quality loan demand decreased while deposits continued to grow  resulting in additional funds to invest 
in  the company completed a short term leverage strategy by borrowing from the federal home loan bank and reinvesting those funds primarily in mortgage backed securities 
vail banks investment policy is designed primarily to ensure liquidity and to meet pledging requirements and secondarily to provide acceptable investment income 
management s focus is on maintaining a high quality investment portfolio oriented primarily toward mortgage backed and other government agency securities 
the determination of the amount and maturity of securities purchased is a function of liquidity and income projections based on the existing  and expected  balance sheet and interest rate forecasts 
vail banks is required to account for investment securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
at the date of purchase  vail banks is required to classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading  or available for sale 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
since its inception  vail banks has not had any trading account activities 
investments not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss until realized 
since the initial classification of its investment securities  vail banks has not transferred any investment securities between categories  nor has it sold any investment securities classified as held to maturity 
the following tables set forth information regarding the investment composition of vail banks as of the dates indicated

loans loan portfolio composition the following table sets forth the composition of vail banks loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated 
management believes that the balance sheet information as of the dates indicated should be read in conjunction with the average balance information in the previous tables above under the caption average balance sheet and net interest income analysis 
vail banks has followed a policy to manage the loan portfolio composition to mitigate risks in specific markets by diversifying the loan portfolio 
however  vail banks does have a concentration of loans in the commercial  industrial and land category 
as a result of seasonal trends in the retail  service and real estate markets  balances of commercial loans may fluctuate significantly 
gross loans outstanding at december  amount amount amount amount amount in thousands commercial  industrial and land   real estate construction    real estate mortgage    consumer      total     at december   gross loans were million  which was an increase of million  or  over million at december  this increase was primarily due the strengthening of the economy  a focused effort to generate loan volume  stronger loan management recruiting  and a focus on customer needs 
significant growth occurred across the company s commercial  real estate construction  and real estate mortgage portfolios 
at december   gross loans were million  which was a decrease of million  or  over million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the continued softening of the economy  a continued conservative underwriting policy  and a temporary internal focus on resolving problem loans 
commercial  industrial  and land loans principally include loans to service  real estate and retail businesses and to a small degree  agricultural interests 
these loans are primarily secured by real estate and operating business assets 
commercial  industrial and land loans are made on the basis of the repayment ability and financial strength of the borrower as well as the collateral securing the loans 
real estate construction loans principally include short term loans to fund the construction of buildings and residences or to purchase land for planned and near term commercial or residential development 
these loans are primarily non revolving lines of credit and are secured by real estate  typically well margined with a first security lien 
real estate mortgage loans principally include short term financing for existing one to four family residences 
the majority of these loans have maturities of less than five years 
these loans are secured by the subject real estate  typically well margined with a first lien position 
consumer loans to individuals principally include one to five year loans for consumer items  such as automobiles  motor homes and other goods 
these loans are typically secured  at minimum  by the items being financed 
banking officers are assigned various levels of credit extension approval authority based upon their respective levels of experience and expertise 
credit relationships exceeding million  and in other circumstances pursuant to the company s credit policy  are evaluated and acted upon by the directors credit committee and are reported to the board of directors board on a monthly basis 
vail banks strategy for approving or disapproving extensions of credit is to follow a conservative credit policy and underwriting practices which include extending credit on a sound and collectible basis  investing funds for the benefit of shareholders and the protection of depositors  serving the needs of the community and vail banks general market area while obtaining a balance between maximum yield and minimum risk  ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the credit extended  developing and maintaining diversification in the loan portfolio as a whole and of the loans within each loan category  and ensuring that each extension of credit is properly documented and  if appropriate  insurance coverage is adequate 
vail banks credit review and compliance associates interact daily with commercial and consumer lenders to identify potential underwriting or technical exception variances 
in addition  vail banks has placed increased emphasis on early identification of problem loans in an effort to aggressively seek resolution of such situations 
management believes that this strict adherence to conservative credit policy guidelines has contributed to vail banks reduced level of credit losses 
loan maturities the following table presents loans by maturity in each major category at december  actual maturities may differ from the contractual repricing maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications 
gross loan maturities at december  within year years a over years a total in thousands commercial  industrial and land    real estate construction    real estate mortgage     consumer    total     a of the loans with maturities over one year  million had adjustable interest rates and the remainder had fixed interest rates 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and foreclosed properties 
when  in the opinion of management  a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of interest  regardless of the delinquency status of the loan  the accrual of interest income is discontinued and interest accrued but uncollected during the current year is generally reversed through a charge to current year earnings 
while the loan is on nonaccrual status  interest income is recognized only upon receipt and then only if  in the judgment of management  there is no reasonable doubt as to the collectibility of the principal balance 
loans days or more delinquent generally are changed to nonaccrual status unless the loan is in the process of collection and management determines that full collection of principal and accrued interest is probable 
interest income that would have been recorded for nonaccrual loans  had they been performing in accordance with their contractual requirements  was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
actual interest income recorded for these loans was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including reduction of interest rate below a rate otherwise available to the borrower or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
the following table sets forth information concerning the non performing assets of vail banks as of the dates indicated 
asset quality at december  in thousands nonaccrual loans     restructured loans total non performing loans     foreclosed properties total non performing assets     loans days or more past due and accruing total risk assets      non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total loans plus foreclosed properties non performing assets to total assets risk assets to total loans plus foreclosed properties since  the company completed foreclosures and subsequent sales of real estate as well as achieved resolution on several large loans that were previously on non accrual  resulting in a decrease in non performing loans and related ratios 
the majority of the non accrual loans are real estate secured  are recorded at net realizable value  and are subject to foreclosure or other collection proceedings 
management believes vail banks is adequately collateralized to recover the majority of the balance of these nonaccrual loans 
management generally obtains and maintains appraisals on real estate collateral 
management is not aware of any adverse trends relating to vail banks loan portfolio  not reflected above 
at december   there were no loans excluded from non performing loans set forth above where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in such loans becoming non performing 
analysis of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses the allowance represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for probable loan losses based on management s assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including a review of problem loans  business conditions  historical loss experience  evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and holding and disposal costs 
the allowance is increased by additional charges to operating income and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries

weststar lending associates are responsible for ongoing reviews of the quality of the loan portfolio 
during  the company established an internal loan review function that issues quarterly reports to the audit committee 
state and federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  also review weststar s loans and its allowance 
a list containing problem loans is updated and reviewed by management and the board monthly 
management has an internal goal to maintain the allowance for loan losses between and of average gross loans 
the recorded allowance is the aggregate of the sfas and sfas components 
in order to comply with certain regulatory requirements  management has prepared the following allocation of vail banks allowance for loan losses among various categories of the loan portfolio for each of the years in the five year period ended december  in management s opinion  such allocation has  at best  a limited utility 
it is based on management s assessment as of a given point in time of the risk characteristics for each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change 
such allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge offs may be taken  nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends 
by presenting such allocation  management does not mean to imply that the allocation is exact or that the allowance has been precisely determined from such allocation 
additionally  during  the company changed its methodology for computing the allowance for loan losses 
a significant portion of the sfas component has not been allocated to each of the four categories specified in the table below  but rather represents loans in all four categories 
it is represented by the term cross allocated in the table below 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses amount in thousands commercial  industrial and land   real estate construction  real estate mortgage consumer cross allocated     unallocated total      deposits vail banks primary source of funds has historically been in market customer deposits 
deposit products are concentrated in business and personal checking and money market accounts  including interest bearing and non interest bearing accounts 
generally  deposits are short term in nature with approximately of deposits having a committed term less than three months and approximately having a committed term of less than one year 
vail banks resort locations experience a seasonality of deposits  however  deposits in non resort oriented markets help to mitigate such seasonality 
total deposits were million at december   a million  or a  increase from the balance at december  this increase was primarily related to a focused effort to gather funding in anticipation of a positive turnaround in the economy and greater loan demand 
additionally  the selective pricing of deposit products as well as the maturing of newer offices also contributed to the increase in deposits

liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to meet its commitments and obligations with available funds 
these commitments may include paying dividends to shareholders  funding new loans for borrowers  funding withdrawals by depositors  paying general and administrative expenses  and funding capital expenditures 
historically  the company s primary source of funds has been customer deposits 
scheduled loan repayments are also a relatively stable source of funds 
deposit inflows and unscheduled loan repayments  which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  returns available on other investments  competition  economic conditions and other factors  are relatively unstable 
other sources of liquidity include sale or maturity of investment securities and the ability to borrow funds 
company borrowing may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
company borrowing may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending and investing activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets

the net decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a million decrease in loans held for sale offset by a  increase in other assets 
this decrease in loans held for sale during the last quarter of was primarily attributable to slowing mortgage refinancing activity

with favorable mortgage interest rates during  refinancings continued to be strong  accounting for the increase in loans held for sale 
the decline in the loan portfolio during resulted in a related decline in the interest receivable on loans 
the increase in interest payable and other liabilities was partly due to the million increase in fhlb borrowings over december  net cash from investing activities during  net cash of million was used by investing activities 
these outflows consisted primarily of million increase in net loans  million of purchases of investment securities  and the purchase of million of premises and equipment to complete the construction of the building in glenwood springs  to remodel several owned buildings and to upgrade equipment

these outflows were partially offset by the receipt of million of net proceeds from short and long term fhlb advances 
the decrease in deposits was largely attributable to a decline in money market rates  offset by the introduction of a new short term certificate of deposit product 
this new product enabled weststar to attract new money as well as retain funds from maturing certificates of deposit 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for are estimated to be between million and million associated primarily with the construction of a new facility in fruita  expansion or remodeling of existing facilities  and routine replacement and upgrades of furniture and equipment 
the company will fund these expenditures from various sources  including operating cash flows  retained earnings and borrowings 
borrowings the following table presents an analysis of the company s borrowing activities for the years indicated

weststar is a member of the fhlb of topeka and  as a regular part of its business  obtains advances from the fhlb 
advances are collateralized by certain mortgage loans or deeds of trust as well as fhlb stock owned by weststar 
as of december   the authorized borrowing line totaled million 
of this amount  million was an irrevocable stand by letter of credit pledged as collateral for uninsured public fund deposits  million was outstanding as short term advances and million was outstanding as long term advances 
the long term advances mature from through early repayment of advances will result in a prepayment penalty

stock repurchase plan at its meeting on january   the company s board of directors reauthorized the company s stock repurchase program that was originally approved in february the total amount of repurchases under the program  both previously completed and allowable up to january  aggregate approximately million 
since inception of the program through december   the company has repurchased  shares at an average price of per share  or approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to credit related financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit 
a commitment to extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation 
collateral held varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment and income producing commercial properties 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
letters of credit are used to guarantee performance primarily on development and construction projects 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
those commitments are primarily issued on behalf of local businesses 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the company uses the same credit underwriting procedures for making commitments and letters of credit as for on balance sheet instruments 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis and the amount of collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held varies  but may include unimproved and improved real estate  certificates of deposit  personal property or other acceptable collateral 
all of these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the total amounts of these instruments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements because a significant portion of these instruments often expire without being used 
the amounts outstanding under these financial instruments are described below as other commercial commitments 
we are not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments or that could significantly impact earnings 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables present the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands fhlb borrowings      trust preferred securities   operating leases   total contractual cash obligations    amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total amounts committed less than year years years over years in thousands commitments to extend credit     customer letters of credit   total commercial commitments     many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon 
thus  the indicated commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents including federal funds sold of million and investment securities of million 
almost of the company s investment portfolio is classified as available for sale and can be readily sold to meet liquidity needs  however million of this amount has been pledged to secure public fund deposits and  has been sold under agreements to repurchase 
accordingly  those pledged amounts may not be available to meet general liquidity needs 
based on current plans and business conditions  the company expects that its cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and available borrowing capacity under its credit facilities  together with any amounts generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek other financing sooner or that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
concentrations of credit risk concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of counterparties have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in the economy or other conditions 
the company s loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and real estate loans located in colorado  making the value of the portfolio susceptible to declines in real estate values and other changes in economic conditions in colorado 
the company does not believe it has excessive exposure to any individual customer 
effect of inflation and changing prices the banking industry is unique in that substantially all of the assets and liabilities are of a monetary nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more profound effect on a bank s performance than does inflation 
although there is not always a direct relationship between the movement in the prices of goods and services and changes in interest rates  increases in inflation generally lead to increases in interest rates 
however  in short periods of time interest rates may not move in the same direction or magnitude as inflation 
asset and liability management vail banks earnings depend to a significant extent on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and the interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings 
the net interest margin is highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond vail banks control 
these factors include competitive and general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
changes in the discount rate or targeted federal funds rate by the federal reserve bank usually lead to general changes in interest rates 
these interest rate shifts affect vail banks interest income  interest expense and investment portfolio 
also  governmental policies  such as the creation of a tax deduction for individual retirement accounts  can increase savings and affect the cost of funds 
from time to time  the interest rate structures of earning assets and liabilities may not be balanced  and a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the net interest margin and results of operations of vail banks 
vail banks cannot predict the nature  timing and effect of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies 
the liquidity position of vail banks is monitored by management and its asset liability committee 
a principal function of asset liability management is to coordinate the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income variances in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that are subject to repricing in the near term  including both variable rate instruments and those fixed rate instruments which are approaching maturity 
changes in net interest income can occur when interest rates on interest sensitive assets  such as loans and investment securities  change in a different time period from that of the interest rates on liabilities  such as deposits 
these differences  or gaps  provide an indication of the extent that net interest income may be affected by future changes in interest rates 
a positive gap exists when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities and indicates that a greater volume of assets than liabilities will reprice during a given time period 
with a positive gap  rising rate environments generally enhance earnings  while a declining rate environment has a tendency to depress earnings 
conversely  a negative gap exists when interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets 
with a negative gap  rising rate environments usually depress earnings  while declining rate environments tend to enhance earnings 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of vail banks assets and liabilities at december   and sets forth the repricing dates of vail banks interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of that date  as well as vail banks interest rate sensitivity gap percentages for the periods presented 
this table indicates vail banks will be in an asset sensitive or positive gap position for the twelve month period ending december  during that period  million of interest earning assets will reprice compared to million of interest bearing liabilities 
this asset sensitive position would generally indicate that vail banks net interest income would decrease should interest rates fall and increase should interest rates rise 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly while the timing of the repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same 
the table is based on assumptions as to when assets and liabilities will reprice in a changing interest rate environment  and since such assumptions can be no more than estimates  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes than those estimated 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
therefore  the following table does not necessarily indicate the actual future impact of interest rate movements on vail banks net interest income

this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements arb  addresses consolidation by business enterprises where ownership interests in an entity may vary over time or in many cases  of special purpose entities spe s 
to be consolidated for financial reporting  these spe s must have certain characteristics 
arb requires that an enterprise s consolidated financial statements include only subsidiaries in which the enterprise has a controlling financial interest 
the company adopted fin r on january  as a result of adoption  the company no longer consolidates its two subsidiary trusts that had been formed in to issue trust preferred securities because the company does not have controlling financial interests over the trusts  as specifically defined by fin r 
the effect of this change is that the company now excludes the trust preferred securities issued by the subsidiary trusts from its consolidated balance sheets and includes the subordinated debentures issued by the company to the trusts

qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk arising from the instruments and transactions into which the company enters 
these include loans  securities available for sale  deposit liabilities  and borrowings 
interest rate risk occurs when interest sensitive assets and liabilities reprice at different times as market interest rates change 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that are subject to repricing in the near term  including both variable rate instruments and those fixed rate instruments that are approaching maturity 
for example  if fixed rate assets are funded with floating rate debt  the spread between asset and liability rates will decline or turn negative if rates increase 
additionally  interest rate risk results from changing spreads between asset and liability rates 
interest rate risk is managed by the company s asset liability committee 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses computer simulations that determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and borrowings 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these computer simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
as of december   the company has never used interest rate derivative financial instruments as an asset liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate exposures 
management continually monitors the company s exposure to fluctuations in market rates 
one of the tools management utilizes to estimate the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changes in interest rates is an interest rate simulation model 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of loan growth and deposit and loan repricing characteristics 
the simulation model measures the potential change in net interest income for future periods under various interest rate scenarios 
based on these simulation models  if interest rates increased basis points during  net interest income would increase an estimated million for the year ended december  and an estimated million for the year ended december  on the contrary  if interest rates decreased basis points during net interest income would decrease an estimated  for the year end december  and million for the year ended december
