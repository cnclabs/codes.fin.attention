item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto 
overview hecla mining company is a precious metals company engaged in the exploration  development  mining and processing of silver  gold  lead and zinc primarily in the united states  mexico and venezuela 
we generate revenues  income and cash flows from the sale of silver  gold  lead and zinc 
as a result  our earnings are directly related to the prices of these metals 
the year ended with prices higher than in and exhibited wide variability throughout the year due to numerous factors beyond our control 
price high low average gold  per ounce silver  per ounce lead  per tonne zinc  per tonne in the event these metals prices decline  our results will be adversely affected 
although we feel our strong balance sheet and low cost properties will allow us to continue to be successful even in the event of moderate metals price declines  no assurance can be given that we will continue to be successful 
we manage the company on the basis of production from our operating units  which in included three segments the united states segment silver operations o the lucky friday unit in idaho metal concentrates o the greens creek unit in alaska metal concentrates and dor the mexico segment silver operation o the san sebastian unit dor and precipitate the venezuela segment gold operation o the la camorra unit dor we produce metal concentrates and precipitates  which we sell to custom smelters on contract  and unrefined gold and silver bullion bars dor  which are further refined before sale to metals traders 
we maintained our position in as the lowest cost primary silver producer and one of the lowest cost gold producers in the industry 
our venezuela segment saw continued strong gold production at of its level 
silver production from our united states segment declined by from its record level  while maintaining silver cash costs per ounce within of levels 
our mexico segment  which was negatively impacted by a continuing strike at the velarde a milling facility for most of the fourth quarter  experienced a decline in silver production from to  with rising cash costs attributable to alterations in the mine plan due to entry into the final year of mine life 
during  we believe that we continued to lay the foundation for long term growth of our operations through significant investments in exploration  development  and strengthening of our land positions 
our focus in is to continue progress on major capital projects already under way  exploration and development of new and existing targets  and low cost production  all of which should help build our resource base and help maintain our low costs in the long term 
our strategy consists of the following maintaining our production and cost profile  significantly increasing our proven and probable reserves via investment in exploration and acquisitions  positioning the company to double our silver and gold production  maintaining our financial strength  and focusing on silver and gold assets and production 
our balance sheet retained a strong position in with no debt and a current ratio of to as of december  our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased by million as we utilized million in for investment in exploration  pre development  and capital facilities designed to build our profile of what we believe will be long term  low cost operations 
our commitment to exploration and pre development resulted in a decrease of million in operating cash flow  from million in to million in one of the risks we face is that our mines have a relatively small amount of proven and probable reserves  primarily because we have low volume  underground operations 
throughout our century plus history  that has always been the case and is likely to be so in the future 
our strategy to increase production and expand our proven and probable reserves is to focus on development and exploration at  or in the vicinity of  our currently owned properties  as well as potential future acquisitions 
we committed more resources to exploration and pre development in than at any time in our history  and in will continue our investment in our future to strive to achieve our production goals 
in january  we signed a letter of intent to acquire the guariche gold project in venezuela  which would more than double our land position in that country 
completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of conditions  and as such  there can be no assurance that the acquisition will be completed 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we continue to face risks associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a million accrual for past response costs within the coeur d alene basin area in idaho  in addition to the million accrued in  and million for future expenditures at the grouse creek mine in central idaho 
in the coeur d alene basin litigation  we estimate that the range of our potential liability is million to million and we have accrued the minimum amount in accordance with gaap  as we believe there is no amount within the range that is more probable 
the coeur d alene basin area is a litigation matter involving multiple trial phases  and it is reasonably possible that our estimate of our liability may change in the future depending on the outcome of the second phase of the trial surrounding this matter 
we will continue to manage and prepare for this matter  although the ultimate outcome is not known at this time 
for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in february  we reduced the number of series b preferred shares outstanding by  shares  or  pursuant to an exchange offer 
this exchange offer allowed participating shareholders to receive shares of common stock for each preferred share exchanged  which resulted in the issuance of a total of  common shares 
during march  we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with holders of approximately of the then outstanding preferred stock  preferred shares to exchange such shares for shares of common stock 
a total of  preferred shares were exchanged for  common shares as a result of the privately negotiated exchange agreements 
as of december   a total of  shares of preferred stock remain issued and outstanding 
the following table displays our actual silver and gold production in thousand ounces by operation for the years ended december   and  and projected silver and gold production for the year ending december  see special note on forward looking statements and item business and item properties operating properties the la camorra unit 
projected actual silver ounce production san sebastian unit greens creek unit lucky friday unit total silver ounces gold ounce production la camorra unit san sebastian unit greens creek unit total gold ounces our mill that processes ore from our san sebastian mine has experienced a strike by employees since mid october  which has continued into the production estimates for san sebastian assume that a timely  satisfactory resolution to the strike can be reached in the mine plan for san sebastian estimates that mining will cease in the middle of reflects our portion 
total cash and total production costs  and average metals prices were as follows average costs per ounce of silver produced total cash costs per ounce oz 
 total production costs per ounce oz 
 average costs per ounce of gold produced total cash costs per ounce oz 
 total production costs per ounce oz 
 average metals prices silver handy harman oz 
gold realized oz 
gold london final oz 
lead lme cash pound zinc lme cash pound the higher costs per silver ounce during compared to are due in part to lower grades affecting production at all three silver operations and greater depth of mining at the lucky friday mine which increased costs  partly offset by significant by product credits from an increased gold price and base metals prices 
strike related costs associated with our mill in mexico totaling  have been excluded from silver costs per ounce 
our costs per ounce amounts are calculated pursuant to standards of the gold institute 
costs per ounce of gold are based on the gold produced from our gold operating properties only 
gold produced from san sebastian and greens creek is treated as a by product credit in calculating silver costs per ounce 
gold produced from ores purchased from third parties is treated as a by product credit in calculating gold costs per ounce 
cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent measurements that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of its mining operations that are not in accordance with gaap 
we believe cash costs per ounce of silver or gold provide an indicator of cash flow generation at each location and on a consolidated basis  as well as providing a meaningful basis to compare our results to those of other mining companies and other mining operating properties 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found below under reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs gaap 
results of operations compared to for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of approximately million  compared to a net loss of approximately million in although the net losses for and were similar  was positively impacted by improved metals prices and lower accruals for future environmental and reclamation expenditures  offset by decreased production and higher exploration and pre development costs 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded losses applicable to common shareholders of approximately million per common share and million per common share  respectively 
included in the losses were preferred stock dividends of million and million  respectively 
the and dividends included non cash charges of approximately million and million  respectively  related to exchanges of preferred stock for common stock 
in december  our board of directors declared an per share dividend payable january   on the remaining  outstanding shares of preferred stock 
in order to preserve cash for exploration  capital and potential acquisition opportunities  we have not paid past dividends totaling approximately million

the mexico segment for the year ended december   the san sebastian unit  located in the state of durango  mexico  reported sales of million  compared to million in  and income from operations of million in  compared to million in the decreases are primarily due to a and decrease in silver and gold production  respectively  resulting from significantly lower silver and gold ore grades and a strike at the processing mill which impacted production from october through the end of the year  offset by higher average metals prices 
cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products increased to in  from in  primarily due to decreased sales during  and higher mining and processing costs attributable to changes in the nature of the orebody 
the grade of silver ore at san sebastian decreased to approximately ounces per ton during as compared to ounces per ton during san sebastian had an average grade of ounce of gold per ton during and an average grade of ounce of gold per ton during along with a decrease in tons milled due to a strike at the velarde a mill where we process our ore from the san sebastian mine  in the fourth quarter of  the decreases in ore grade decreased silver production to million ounces during when compared with million ounces produced in  while gold production decreased to approximately  ounces in  compared to approximately  ounces produced in we are currently mining the end of the known resources on the francine and don sergio veins at the san sebastian mine  and we anticipate that the productive capacity of these veins will be exhausted near the middle of production will cease at this mine until new areas are identified and developed 
silver and gold production at san sebastian are estimated to be approximately million ounces and  ounces  respectively  for the year ending december   assuming a successful resolution of the current strike at the processing plant 
the total cash cost per silver ounce at san sebastian increased during to  from a negative during because we consider gold to be a by product of our silver production  it offset the increase in average total costs during the comparable periods due primarily to a higher average gold price than in for the years ended december  and  gold by product credits were approximately per silver ounce and per silver ounce  respectively 
the united states segment greens creek the greens creek unit  a owned joint venture arrangement with kennecott greens creek mining company located on admiralty island  near juneau  alaska  reported sales of million for our account during  as compared to million during  and income from operations of million in  compared to million in the improved results were driven by higher average metals prices and a increase in tons milled  while ore grades for all metals declined 
production totaled approximately million silver ounces in  or approximately million or fewer ounces than in addition  gold  lead and zinc production declined from levels by  and  respectively 
cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products decreased to in  from in  primarily due to increases in gold  silver  lead and zinc prices during  all of which contributed to increased revenues 
ore grades declined during when compared to  with approximately and ounces of silver per ton  respectively  and approximately ounce of gold per ton in compared to ounce of gold per ton in the total cash costs per silver ounce decreased by approximately  to per silver ounce during  from per silver ounce during the decrease in costs per ounce are primarily due to the increased by product credits primarily from higher average gold  silver and base metals prices during for the year ending december   we forecast production to total approximately million silver ounces   gold ounces  and  tons of lead  and  tons of zinc 
lucky friday the lucky friday unit  located in northern idaho and a producing mine for hecla since  reported sales of approximately million during  compared to million during  and income from operations of million in  compared to million in the increase in both sales and income from operations during over is due to an increase in silver and base metals prices 
tons milled increased by  however the silver ore grade declined by as compared to the period 
as a result  production of silver totaled approximately million ounces compared to production in of approximately million ounces 
cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products decreased to in  from in  primarily due to the increase in sales  offset by increased costs for personnel and mining at greater depth 
development continues on the level of the gold hunter deposit  which advanced approximately  feet during  or about two thirds of the way to the orebody 
full production on the new level is expected to begin in early due primarily to increases in operating costs and longer ore haulage  partially offset by higher prices for lead and zinc by products  the total cash costs per silver ounce for increased to  compared to during for the year ending december   we forecast production from the lucky friday mine to total approximately million silver ounces   tons of lead and  tons of zinc 
the venezuela segment we currently operate the la camorra unit  located in the eastern venezuelan state of bolivar  approximately miles southeast of puerto ordaz 
at the present time  la camorra is our sole designated gold operation 
the la camorra unit consists of the la camorra mine  a custom milling business  and exploration and development activities at the block b property located approximately miles north northwest of the la camorra mine 
at the block b property  we have commenced development of an additional operating gold property  mina isidora  during sales of product increased to million  or by  during  from sales of million in  primarily due to an increase in the realized price of gold  which increased during our realized gold prices per ounce at la camorra for and were and  respectively  compared to the london final gold price per ounce of in and in our realized gold prices were less than the london final prices due to forward gold sales commitments at per ounce for a portion of our production 
as of december   all of our forward contracts have been delivered 
for the year ended december   income from operations decreased to million  compared to million during  primarily due to increased exploration expenditures  costs of establishing the new custom milling and block b business units in venezuela and the higher cost of mining at greater depth at the la camorra mine  partially offset by the above mentioned increase in sales 
in order to mine more efficiently at the greater depths of the la camorra mine  we are currently constructing a production shaft that is anticipated to be in service in the second quarter of  which is anticipated to improve the cost structure at this mine 
during  the la camorra unit produced approximately  gold ounces at a total cash cost of per ounce  compared to approximately  gold ounces at a total cash cost of per ounce during during  the la camorra unit produced gold at an average grade of ounce of gold per ton  which is consistent with the grade produced in total gold production for the la camorra unit  including custom milling and anticipated production from mina isidora  is projected to reach approximately  ounces for the year ending december  cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products increased to during  from during we have been able to maintain a similar cost structure in  within one dollar per ton of levels  by increasing our volume of tons produced  and also in part due to the weakening of the venezuelan currency  the bolivar 
as previously discussed above  the venezuelan government fixed the exchange rate of the bolivar to the us dollar at  to  however  markets outside of venezuela in reflected a devaluation of the venezuelan currency in the range of to  which benefits our cost structure 
on march   the venezuelan government increased the fixed exchange rate of the bolivar to the us dollar to  to because of the exchange controls in place and their impact on local suppliers  some supplies  equipment parts and other items we previously purchased in venezuela have been ordered from outside the country 
increased lead times in receiving orders from outside venezuela have continued to require an increase in supply inventory  including an increase of at the la camorra mine as of december   compared to december   and prepayments to vendors  which have increased by million since december venezuela experienced political unrest that resulted in a severe economic downturn in the third quarter of  followed by a contested presidential recall in although we believe we will be able to manage and operate the la camorra unit and related exploration projects successfully  due to the continued uncertainty relating to political  regulatory  legal enforcement  security and economic matters  exportation and exchange controls  and the effect of all of these on our operations including  among other things  litigation  labor stoppages and the impact on our supplies of oil  gas and other supplies  there can be no assurance we will be able to operate without interruptions to our operations 
management is actively monitoring exchange controls in venezuela  although there can be no assurance that the exchange controls will not further affect our operations in venezuela in the future 
in february  venezuela s basic industries minister announced that venezuela will review all foreign investments in non oil basic industries  including gold projects  to maximize technological and developmental benefits and align investments with the current administration s social agenda 
he indicated venezuela is seeking transfers of new technology  technical training and assistance  job growth  greater national content  and creation of local downstream industries and that the transformation would require a fundamental change in economic relations with major multinational companies 
in february  the venezuelan national guard impounded a shipment of approximately  ounces of gold dor produced from the la camorra unit  which is owned and operated by our wholly owned subsidiary  minera hecla venezolana  ca mhv 
the impoundment was allegedly made due to irregularities in documentation that accompanied the shipment 
the shipment was stored at the central bank of venezuela 
in march  we filed with the superior tax court in bolivar city  state of bolivar an injunction action against the national guard to release the impounded gold dor 
in april  that court granted our request for an injunction  but conditioned release of the gold pending resolution of an unrelated matter described in the next paragraph involving the venezuelan tax authority seniat that was proceeding in the superior tax court in caracas 
in june  the superior tax court in caracas ordered return of the impounded gold to hecla 
although we encountered difficulties  delays  and costs in enforcing such order  the impounded gold was returned in july and was shipped to our refiner for further processing and sale by us 
all subsequent shipments of gold dor have been exported without intervention by venezuelan government authorities  but there can be no assurance that such impoundments may not occur in the future or  that  if such were to occur  they would be resolved in a similar manner or time frame or upon acceptable conditions or costs 
mhv is also involved in litigation in venezuela with seniat concerning alleged unpaid tax liabilities that predate our purchase of la camorra from monarch resources monarch in pursuant to our purchase agreement  monarch has assumed defense of and responsibility for a pending tax case in the superior tax court in caracas 
in april  seniat filed with the superior tax court in bolivar city  state of bolivar an embargo action against all of mhv s assets in venezuela to secure the alleged unpaid tax liabilities 
in order to prevent the embargo  in april  mhv made a cash deposit with the court of approximately million 
in june  the superior tax court in caracas ordered suspension and revocation of the embargo action filed by the seniat 
although we believe the cash deposit will continue to prevent any further action by seniat with respect to the embargo  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this proceeding 
if the tax court in caracas or an appellate court were to subsequently award seniat its entire requested embargo  it could disrupt our operations in venezuela and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in february  we were notified by the seniat that it had completed its audit of our venezuelan tax returns for the years ended december  and in the notice  the seniat has alleged certain expenses are not deductible for income tax purposes  and that calculations of tax deductions based upon inflationary adjustments were overstated  and has issued an assessment that is equal to taxes payable of million 
we have initiated a review of the seniat s findings  and believe the seniat s assessments are inappropriate  and we expect to vigorously defend our position 
any resolution could involve significant delay  legal proceedings  and related costs and uncertainty 
we have not accrued any amounts associated with the tax audits as of december  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending ourselves against the tax assessment  that there will not be additional assessments in the future or that seniat or other governmental agencies or officials may not take other actions against us  whether or not justified  that could disrupt our operations in venezuela and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in february  the venezuelan government announced new regulations concerning the export of goods and services from venezuela  which will require  effective april   all goods and services to be invoiced in the currency of the country of destination or in us dollars 
in  we recognized approximately million in reductions to cost of sales related to our ability to export production in bolivares 
we are currently evaluating the impact of these new regulations  however  we may no longer be able to export our production in bolivares  which could result in an increase in our costs 
in addition  the new regulations may impact our cash flows  our profitability of operations  and our production in venezuela 
there can be no assurance that further developments or interpretations of these regulations are limited to the impact we have described herein 
the central bank of venezuela maintains regulations concerning the export of gold from venezuela 
under current regulations  of our gold production from venezuela is required to be sold in venezuela 
prior to our acquisition of the la camorra mine  the previous owners had sold substantially all of the gold production to the central bank of venezuela and built up a significant credit to cover the requirement  which we assumed upon our acquisition 
since we began operating in venezuela in  all our production of gold has been exported and no sales have been made in the venezuelan market 
we currently expect that our credit for national sales will be exhausted in the middle of  and we may be required to sell of our future gold production to either the central bank of venezuela or to other customers within venezuela 
markets within venezuela are limited  and historically the central bank of venezuela has been the primary customer of gold 
there can be no assurance that the central bank of venezuela will purchase gold from us  and we may be required to sell gold into a limited market  which could result in lower sales and cash flows from gold as a result of discounts  or we may have to inventory a portion of our gold production until such time we find a suitable purchaser for our gold 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
because of the exchange controls in place and their impact on local suppliers  some supplies  equipment parts and other items we previously purchased in venezuela have been ordered from outside the country 
increased lead times in receiving orders from outside venezuela have continued to require an increase in supply inventory  as well as prepayments to vendors  as of december   compared to december  in addition  our operations may also be affected by the presence of small and or illegal miners who attempt to operate on the fringes of major mining operations 
although we  in conjunction with local authorities and or the venezuelan national guard  employ strategies to control the presence and or impact of such miners  including commencing a custom milling program in for small mining cooperatives working in the area of mina isidora  there can be no assurance that such miners will not adversely affect our operations or that the local authorities and or the venezuelan national guard will continue to assist our efforts to control their impact 
although we believe we will be able to manage and operate the la camorra unit and related exploration projects successfully  due to the continued uncertainty relating to political  regulatory  legal enforcement  security and economic matters  exportation and exchange controls  and the effect of all of these on our operations including  among other things  changes in policy or demands of governmental agencies or their officials  litigation  labor stoppages and the impact on our supplies of oil  gas and other supplies  there can be no assurance we will be able to operate without interruptions to our operations 
management is actively monitoring exchange controls in venezuela  although there can be no assurance that the exchange controls will not further affect our operations in venezuela in the future for additional information  see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
corporate matters general and administrative expenses increased million during compared to  primarily due to addition of personnel  offset by decreased employee incentive compensation during exploration expense increased million during compared to  primarily due to increased exploration expenditures in mexico on the don sergio vein and other areas at or near san sebastian million  at the noche buena project in northern mexico million  and in venezuela on the block b concessions million and at or near the la camorra mine million 
offsetting the increased exploration expenditures during are decreased corporate development costs million 
pre development expense increased million during compared to  due to increased activity at the hollister development block in nevada  for which final permits have been issued and surface and underground construction has commenced 
other operating expense  net of other operating income  increased million during  from income of million in to an expense of million in  primarily due to a one time million cash litigation settlement received during and increased legal  consulting and accounting expenses incurred in related to sarbanes oxley compliance million  partially offset by decreased accruals of million for tax offset bonuses on employee stock options outstanding due to the decreases in our common stock price throughout compared to the provision for closed operations and environmental matters decreased million during  to million from million in the most significant provisions in were primarily for past response costs in idaho s coeur d alene basin million and for the grouse creek mine cleanup in central idaho million 
provisions in were primarily for future anticipated expenditures in the coeur d alene basin million and for the grouse creek mine cleanup million 
interest income decreased million to million in  from million in  primarily due to interest income received in from the mexican government for interest on unpaid value added tax receivables million  offset by increased income generated from short term investments million 
interest expense decreased million during compared to  principally due to lower average borrowings 
at december   we had no outstanding debt 
the provision for income taxes increased by million to million in from million in  as a result of an increase in the deferred tax provision of million 
the deferred tax provision of million is the result of an increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets in mexico  compared to a deferred tax provision for of million 
the current tax provision of million consists of a us federal alternative minimum tax liability  state minimum taxes  a foreign current provision in mexico  and accrued foreign withholding taxes on interest expense  compared to a current tax provision for of million

included in the net loss for is a positive cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million relating to the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
for additional information  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
compared to for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million  compared to net income of million in  primarily due to an accrual in totaling million for future environmental and reclamation expenditures  partially offset primarily by significantly improved operating results  including a increase in gross profit 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded losses applicable to common shareholders of approximately million per common share and million per common share  respectively 
included in the losses were preferred stock dividends of million and million  respectively  for and  which included non cash dividend charges of approximately million and million  respectively  related to exchanges of preferred stock for common stock 
the non cash dividends represent the difference between the value of the common stock issued in the exchange transactions and the value of the shares of common stock that would have been issued if the shares of the preferred stock had been converted into common stock pursuant to their terms 
for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  we recorded accruals totaling million for future environmental and reclamation expenditures  primarily for future anticipated expenditures in idaho s coeur d alene basin million and for the grouse creek mine cleanup in central idaho million 
the accrual for the coeur d alene basin was recorded in response to a united states district court ruling in september from the first phase of the trial relating to this matter  which held that we had some liability for yet to be determined natural resource damages and response costs due to our historic mining practices 
although the us government previously issued a record of decision proposing a cleanup plan totaling approximately million  based upon the court s prior orders  including its september order and other factors and issues to be addressed by the court in the second phase of the trial relating to this matter  we estimated the range of our potential liability in the basin to be million to million  with no amount in the range being more likely than any other number at that time 
based upon generally accepted accounting principles  we accrued the minimum liability within the range 
as of december   we had estimated and accrued a potential liability for claims in the coeur d alene basin litigation of million 
for additional information on the coeur d alene basin and court ruling  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at the grouse creek mine  which suspended operations in  we have commenced dewatering of the tailings impoundment and updated a year closure plan that provided the basis for the increase in estimated costs 
as of december   we had estimated and accrued a liability for reclamation activities at the grouse creek mine of million 
included in the loss is a positive cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million relating to the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement was adopted on january   and required that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
the gain of million represents the difference between the amounts determined under sfas no 
and amounts previously recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also benefited from a million cash settlement received from zemex corporation during the first quarter of for its subsidiary s failure to close on its agreement to purchase from us the kentucky tennessee clay company  kentucky tennessee feldspar corporation and kentucky tennessee clay de mexico collectively the k t group in january in furtherance of our determination to focus operations on silver and gold mining and to raise cash to retire debt and provide working capital  in  our board of directors made the decision to sell the industrial minerals segment 
in march  we completed a sale of the k t group and certain other minor inactive industrial minerals companies 
in march  we completed a sale of the pet operations of the colorado aggregate division cac of mwca  inc reflected in the loss applicable to common shareholders during is a loss from discontinued operations of million per common share 
in march  we sold the remaining inventories of the briquette division of cac  which represented the remaining portion of our industrial minerals segment 
as of december   we no longer produce or sell any product from our former industrial minerals segment and all activity during is considered a general corporate activity and presented as other where appropriate 
for the year ended december   cac reported a loss from operations of approximately  during and  we shipped approximately  tons and  tons  respectively  from the industrial minerals segment 
for additional information on our former industrial minerals segment  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the mexico segment for the year ended december   the san sebastian unit reported sales of million  compared to million in  and income from operations of million in  compared to million in these increases were primarily due to a and increase in silver and gold production  respectively  resulting from significantly higher silver and gold ore grades  combined with higher average metals prices 
cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products decreased to in  from in  primarily due to increased sales during and the cost saving transition to owner mining during the first quarter of san sebastian reached full production capacity during the second quarter of the grade of silver ore at san sebastian improved to approximately ounces per ton during compared to ounces per ton during san sebastian had an average grade of ounce of gold per ton during and an average grade of ounce of gold per ton during despite a decrease in tons milled due to the transition to owner mining and associated learning curve that was expected  the increases in ore grade increased silver production to million ounces during when compared with million ounces produced in  while gold production increased to approximately  ounces in compared to approximately  ounces produced in the total cash cost at san sebastian decreased by during to a negative  from during because gold is considered a by product of our silver production  it contributed to the decrease in average total costs during the comparable periods due primarily to increased gold production and a higher average gold price 
for the years ended december  and  gold by product credits were approximately per silver ounce and per silver ounce  respectively 
the united states segment greens creek the greens creek unit reported sales of million for our account during  as compared to million during  and income from operations of million in  compared to million in  primarily due to higher average metals prices  a increase in tons milled and a increase in silver production  resulting in approximately million ounces in  partially offset by lower gold and zinc production of and  respectively 
cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products decreased to in  from in  primarily due to increases in gold  silver  lead and zinc prices during  all of which contributed to increased revenues 
since  greens creek has made many improvements to the mill which have led to a steady increase in processing throughput 
the increase from to was due to several minor improvements  primarily from de bottlenecking the grinding circuit 
ore grades remained approximately the same during when compared to  at approximately ounces per ton of silver for both periods and approximately ounce of gold per ton in compared to ounce of gold per ton in the total cash costs per silver ounce decreased by approximately to per silver ounce during from per silver ounce during the decreases in costs per ounce are primarily due to the increased by product credits primarily from a higher average gold price during lucky friday the lucky friday unit reported sales of approximately million during  compared to million during  and income from operations of million in  compared with a loss from operations of million in the increase in both sales and income from operations during over is due primarily to an increase in metals prices and an increase in the silver ore grade resulting in approximately million ounces in silver production  an increase of over  offset slightly by a decrease in tons milled 
also contributing to the increases during both comparable periods is an increase in lead and zinc production  as well as increases in their prices 
cost of sales and other direct production costs as a percentage of sales from products decreased to in  from in  primarily due to the increase in sales  partially offset by increased costs for equipment upgrades and increased maintenance and development costs 
due primarily to the increase in silver production  the total cash costs per silver ounce for decreased to  compared to during the venezuela segment sales of product from the la camorra unit decreased to million  or by  during  from sales of million in  primarily due to a decrease in gold ounces produced due to lower grade ore  offset by increases in the realized price of gold  which increased during from our realized gold price per ounce at la camorra for and was and  respectively  compared to the london final gold price per ounce of and  respectively 
our realized gold prices were less than the london final prices due to forward gold sales commitments at per ounce for a portion of our production 
as of december   a total of  ounces of gold remained subject to forward contracts at the price of per ounce 
for the year ended december   income from operations decreased to million  or  compared to million during  primarily due to the above mentioned decrease in sales  as well as an increase in exploration expenditures

reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to cost of sales and other direct production costs gaap the following tables present reconciliations between non gaap total cash costs to cost of sales and other direct production costs gaap for our gold the venezuela segment only and silver operations the mexico and united states segments  as well as a reconciliation for each individual silver operating property  for the years ended december   and in thousands  except costs per ounce 
we believe cash costs per ounce of silver or gold provide an indicator of cash flow generation at each location and on a consolidated basis  as well as providing a meaningful basis to compare our results to those of other mining companies and other operating mining properties 
cost of sales and other direct production costs is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap to total cash costs

our cash needs over the next year will be primarily related to capital expenditures  exploration activities  reclamation expenditures  and the possibility of further investment opportunities or future acquisitions  and will be funded through a combination of current cash  maturities or sales of investments  future cash flows from operations and or future borrowings or debt or equity security issuances 
although we believe existing cash and cash equivalents are adequate  we cannot project the cash impact of possible future investment opportunities or acquisitions  and our operating properties may require more cash than forecasted 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the table below presents our fixed  non cancelable contractual obligations and commitments primarily related to our earn in agreement obligations  outstanding purchase orders certain capital expenditures and lease arrangements as of december  in thousands

payments due by period thereafter total purchase obligations contractual obligations earn in agreement operating lease commitments total contractual cash obligations as of december   we were committed to approximately million for the construction of a shaft at the la camorra mine million for transportation  and million for other capital projects 
in august  we entered into an earn in agreement with rodeo creek gold  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of great basin gold ltd 
great basin  concerning exploration  development and production on great basin s hollister development block gold property 
the agreement provides us with an option to earn a working interest in the hollister development block in return for funding a two stage  advanced exploration and development program leading to commercial production 
as of december   we were contractually committed to fund approximately million  which represents the remaining portion of the first stage of the agreement 
the million has not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements  although project to date  we have incurred expenditures of million  which has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements as pre development expenditures 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease arrangements 
we maintain reserves for costs associated with mine closure  reclamation of land and other environmental matters 
at december   our reserves for these matters totaled million  for which no contractual or commitment obligations exist 
future expenditures related to closure  reclamation and environmental expenditures are difficult to estimate  although we anticipate we will make expenditures relating to these obligations over the next years 
during  expenditures for environmental remediation and reclamation are estimated to be in the range of million to million 
for additional information relating to our environmental obligations  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating activities operating activities provided approximately million in cash during  a decrease of million compared to the decreased cash flow is primarily due to higher exploration and pre development costs million  a one time cash settlement from zemex in million  and higher working capital requirements million  offset partly by higher gross profit million 
working capital  excluding cash and short term investments  increased by million  primarily in venezuela million  due to higher receivables for value added taxes and advances to small miners  increased inventories  and higher advances to vendors for receipt of materials with long lead times  partly offset by increased payables to vendors 
the increase in venezuela was offset by a decrease in working capital in mexico  as accounts receivable decreased by million due to collections  offset by increased inventories as a result of a strike at our velarde a mill 
positive non cash elements included provisions for reclamation and closure costs million  which includes the third quarter accrual of million related to the coeur d alene basin and grouse greek mine clean up  charges for depreciation  depletion and amortization million and a change in deferred income taxes primarily a result of utilization of deferred tax assets in mexico million 
we have recorded the value added taxes we paid in venezuela and mexico as recoverable assets 
at december   value added tax receivables totaled million net of a reserve for discounts in venezuela and million in mexico 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of these receivables and have established a reserve against future collection of in venezuela

capital expenditures in also included mine development at the lucky friday unit million  tailings expansion at san sebastian unit million  as well as additions to the mine and mill infrastructure at the greens creek unit million 
in  we estimate our capital expenditures will be in the range of to million  which represents sustaining capital at our existing operations and expansion capital for completion of shaft construction at the la camorra mine  equipment and development at the mina isidora  and continued development at the lucky friday unit 
there can be no assurance that our estimated capital expenditures for will be in the range we have projected

we repaid all corporate debt million  including borrowings during the year million  offset partly by proceeds received from common stock issued under stock option plans million 
other in october  the employees at the velarde a mill in mexico initiated a strike in an attempt to unionize the employees at the san sebastian mine 
the mine employees have informed us  the union and the ministry of labor that they do not want to be organized 
although we are meeting regularly with government and union officials to resolve the issue  there can be no assurance as to the outcome or length of the strike 
the strike impacted our production of silver and gold during the fourth quarter and has continued to impact production into during the fourth quarter of and continuing into  the mine is operating at a normal rate  stockpiling ore in preparation for future processing 
we are also considering contract custom milling facilities that can process the ore 
in february  we reduced the number of series b preferred shares outstanding by  shares  or  pursuant to an exchange offer 
this exchange offer allowed participating shareholders to receive shares of common stock for each preferred share exchanged  which resulted in the issuance of a total of  common shares 
during march  we entered into exchange agreements with holders of approximately of the then outstanding preferred stock  preferred shares to exchange such shares for shares of common stock 
a total of  preferred shares were exchanged for  common shares as a result of these privately negotiated exchanges 
the completed exchanges eliminated million in accumulated dividends on the preferred stock  and reduced the annual dividend payable on the preferred stock by million to million 
as a result of the february and march exchanges  we recorded non cash dividends of approximately million during the first quarter of as of december   a total of  shares of preferred stock remain issued and outstanding 
in order to eliminate the effect of our dividend arrearages on our capital raising activities  we intend to evaluate and potentially implement further programs to reduce the number of remaining preferred shares outstanding  including the possible redemption of shares 
holders of our series b preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at the annual rate of per share  payable quarterly  when and if declared by the board of directors 
as of january   we had not declared and paid the equivalent of six quarterly dividends  entitling holders of the preferred stock to elect two directors at our annual shareholders meeting 
on may   holders of the preferred stock  voting as a class  elected two additional directors  both of whom continue to serve on the board 
in december  we declared a dividend payable on january  to preferred shareholders of record totaling approximately million  and dividends were approved for the first quarter of  payable april  as of january   we have not declared or paid million of cumulated preferred stock dividends 
as of december   we reviewed our pension assumptions regarding benefit plans based upon current market conditions  current asset mix  and our current compensation structure 
as a result  we maintained our assumptions regarding discounts rates at  compensation increases at  and our expected rate of return on plan assets at 
as of the measurement date for pension obligations september   plan assets totaled million and exceeded the benefit obligation by million 
as a result  we do not expect to make contributions to the plans in we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been finally adjudicated 
the ultimate disposition of these matters and various other pending legal actions and claims is not presently determinable 
for information on legal proceedings and claims  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for information on hedged positions and derivative instruments  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a wide variety of estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements 
our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the future resolution of the uncertainties increases  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
our accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have identified our most critical accounting policies below that are important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
revenue recognition sales of metals products sold directly to smelters are recorded when title and risk of loss transfer to the smelter at current spot metals prices 
due to the time elapsed from the transfer to the smelter and the final settlement with the smelter  we must estimate the price at which our metals will be sold in reporting our profitability and cash flow 
recorded values are adjusted monthly until final settlement at month end metals prices and final metal content 
if a significant variance was observed in estimated metals prices or metal content compared to the final actual metals prices and content  our monthly results of operations could be affected 
sales of metals in products tolled  rather than sold to smelters  are recorded at contractual amounts when title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer 
sales of concentrates and precipitates from the greens creek  lucky friday and san sebastian units are sold directly to smelters  with recorded amounts adjusted to month end metals prices until final settlement 
changes in the market price of metals significantly affect our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
metals prices can and often do fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control  such as political and economic conditions  demand  forward selling by producers  expectations for inflation  central bank sales  custom smelter activities  the relative exchange rate of the us dollar  purchases and lending  investor sentiment and global mine production levels 
the aggregate effect of these factors is impossible to predict 
because our revenue is derived from the sale of silver  gold  lead and zinc  our earnings are directly related to the prices of these metals 
if the market prices for these metals fall below our total production costs  we will experience losses on such sales 
proven and probable ore reserves at least annually  management reviews the reserves used to estimate the quantities and grades of ore at our mines which management believes can be recovered and sold economically 
management s calculations of proven and probable ore reserves are based on in house engineering and geological estimates using current operating costs and metals prices 
periodically  management obtains external audits of reserves 
reserve estimates will change as existing reserves are depleted through production and as production costs and or metals prices change 
a significant drop in metals prices reduces reserves by making some portion of such ore uneconomic to develop and produce 
changes in reserves may also reflect that actual grades of ore processed may be different from stated reserve grades because of variation in grades in areas mined  mining dilution and other factors 
estimated reserves  particularly for properties that have not yet commenced production  may require revision based on actual production experience 
declines in the market prices of metals  increased production or capital costs  reduction in the grade or tonnage of the deposit or an increase in the dilution of the ore or reduced recovery rates may render ore reserves uneconomic to exploit unless the utilization of forward sales contracts or other hedging techniques is sufficient to offset such effects 
if our realized price for the metals we produce  including hedging benefits  were to decline substantially below the levels set for calculation of reserves for an extended period  there could be material delays in the development of new projects  net losses  reduced cash flow  restatements or reductions in reserves and asset write downs in the applicable accounting periods 
reserves should not be interpreted as assurances of mine life or of the profitability of current or future operations 
no assurance can be given that the estimate of the amount of metal or the indicated level of recovery of these metals will be realized 
depreciation and depletion the mining industry is extremely capital intensive 
we capitalize property  plant  and equipment and depreciate these items consistent with industry standards 
the cost of property  plant and equipment is charged to depreciation expense based on the estimated useful lives of the assets using straight line and unit of production methods 
depletion is computed using the unit of production method 
as discussed above  our estimates of proven and probable ore reserves may change  possibly in the near term  resulting in changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization rates in future reporting periods 
impairment of long lived assets management reviews the net carrying value of all facilities  including idle facilities  on a periodic basis 
we estimate the net realizable value of each property based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows that will be generated from operations at each property  the estimated salvage value of the surface plant and equipment and the value associated with property interests 
these estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are dependent upon the future metals price estimates over the estimated remaining mine life 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recognized based upon the estimated expected future cash flows from the property discounted at an interest rate commensurate with the risk involved 
management s estimates of metals prices  recoverable proven and probable ore reserves  and operating  capital and reclamation costs are subject to risks and uncertainties of change affecting the recoverability of our investment in various projects 
although management believes it has made a reasonable estimate of these factors based on current conditions and information  it is reasonably possible that changes could occur in the near term which could adversely affect management s estimate of net cash flows expected to be generated from our operating properties and the need for asset impairment write downs 
all estimates and assumptions are inherently subjective to some extent and may be impacted by bias  error  or changing conventions in the methodology of their determination or in changing industry conditions 
environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
the major environmental laws to which we are subject include  among others  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law 
cercla can impose joint and several liability for cleanup and investigation costs  without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct  on current and predecessor owners and operators of a site  as well as those who generate  or arrange for the disposal of  hazardous substances 
the risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the mining industry 
we own or operate property  or have previously owned and operated property  used for industrial purposes 
use of these properties may subject us to potential material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminants and claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to  or release of  hazardous substances 
at our operating properties  we accrue costs associated with environmental remediation obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record a liability for the present value of our estimated environmental remediation costs and the related asset created with it in the period in which the liability is incurred 
the liability will be accreted and the asset will be depreciated over the life of the related asset 
adjustments for changes resulting from the passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation will be made 
at our non operating properties  we accrue costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they are reasonably estimable 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations have historically been recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study for such facility and are charged to provision for closed operations and environmental matters 
we periodically review our accrued liabilities for costs of remediation as evidence becomes available indicating that our remediation liabilities have potentially changed 
such costs are based on management s then current estimate of amounts expected to be incurred when the remediation work is performed within current laws and regulations 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
future closure  reclamation and environment related expenditures are difficult to estimate in many circumstances due to the early stages of investigation  uncertainties associated with defining the nature and extent of environmental contamination  the uncertainties relating to specific reclamation and remediation methods and costs  application and changing of environmental laws  regulations and interpretations by regulatory authorities and the possible participation of other potentially responsible parties 
reserves for closure costs  reclamation and environmental matters totaled million at december   and we anticipate that the majority of these expenditures relating to these reserves will be made over the next years 
this amount was derived from a range of reasonable estimates in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
and aicpa statement of position environmental remediation liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost of remediation could change in the future and that changes to these estimates could have a material effect on future operating results as new information becomes known 
for environmental remediation sites known as of december   if the highest estimate from the range based upon information presently available were recorded  the total estimated liability would be increased by approximately million

foreign exchange in venezuela the venezuelan government has fixed the exchange rate of their currency to the us dollar at  bolivares to  which is the exchange rate we utilize to translate the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary included in our consolidated financial statements 
rules and regulations regarding the implementation of exchange controls in venezuela have been published and periodically revised and or updated 
due to the exchange controls in place  the la camorra unit recognized foreign exchange gains which reduced our cost of sales by million in  and million in  due to the use of multiple exchange rates in valuing us dollar denominated transactions 
as discussed above  the venezuelan government has fixed the exchange rate of the bolivar to the us dollar at  to  however  markets outside of venezuela in reflected a devaluation of the venezuelan currency from such fixed rates ranging from to 
the venezuelan government announced that the exchange rate of their currency to the us dollar changed from its current rate to  bolivares to on march  this devaluation is not expected to have a significant effect on the results of our la camorra unit 
by product credits at the san sebastian unit in mexico cash costs per ounce of silver at the san sebastian unit include significant by product credits from gold production and the continued increase in the price of gold 
cash costs per ounce are calculated pursuant to standards of the gold institute and are consistent with how costs per ounce are calculated within the mining industry 
for the year ended december   the total cash cost was per silver ounce  compared to a negative per silver ounce in  and per silver ounce in for the years ended december   and  gold by product credits were approximately   and per silver ounce  respectively 
by product credits at the san sebastian unit are deducted from operating costs in the calculation of cash costs per ounce 
if our accounting policy were changed to treat gold production as a co product  the following total cash costs per ounce would be reported silver gold cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent measurements that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of its mining operations that are not in accordance with gaap 
we believe cash costs per ounce of silver or gold produced provide an indicator of cash flow generation at each location and on a consolidated basis  as well as providing a meaningful basis to compare our results to those of other mining companies and other mining operating properties 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found under reconciliation of total cash costs to costs of sales and other direct production costs 
value added taxes value added taxes vat are assessed in venezuela on purchases of materials and services 
vat is recorded as an account receivable on our consolidated balance sheet  with a balance of million net of a reserve for anticipated discounts totaling million at december   and million at december  net of a reserve for anticipated discounts of million 
as an exporter from venezuela  we are eligible for refunds from the government for payment of vat  and we prepare a monthly filing to obtain this refund 
refunds are given by the government in the form of tax certificates  which are marketable in venezuela  generally for of face value 
we received our most recent certificate from the venezuelan government in september while we believe that we will receive certificates for all outstanding vat from the venezuelan government  issuance of certificates is slow and the likelihood of recovery at our recorded value may diminish over time 
we have established a reserve of and of face value at december  and  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties  as well as summarizes the financial instruments and derivative instruments held by us at december   which are sensitive to changes in interest rates and commodity prices and are not held for trading purposes 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable see part i  item risk factors
