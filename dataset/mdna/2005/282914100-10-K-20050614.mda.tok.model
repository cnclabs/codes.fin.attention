item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded in and completed an initial public offering of common stock in we develop and market telecommunication technology for internet protocol  or ip  telephony and video applications 
we offer the packet broadband voice over internet protocol  or voip  and video communications service  packet virtual office service and videophone equipment and services 
we shipped our first voip product in  launched our packet service in november  and launched the packet virtual office business service offering in march as of march   we had approximately  packet lines in service 
in fiscal and substantially all of the company s revenues were generated from the sale  license and provision of voip products  services and technology 
prior to fiscal  our focus was on our voip semiconductor business 
in late fiscal  we began to devote more of our resources to the promotion  distribution and development of the packet voice and video communications service than to our existing semiconductor business or hosted ipbx solutions business 
we completed several transactions during fiscal to license and sell technology and assets of these businesses  including the sale of our ip pbx research and development center in france  the sale of our next generation video semiconductor development effort  and the license of technology and manufacturing rights for our voip semiconductor products to other semiconductor companies 
in addition  during january  we announced the end of life of our voip semiconductor products  and began accepting last time buy orders from customers 
this change in our business has resulted in a reduction of revenues  but has enabled us to reduce costs and generate cash from the related license and sale transactions related to the semiconductor and ip pbx businesses 
we continue to own the voice and video technology related to the semiconductor and ip pbx businesses  and utilize this technology in the packet service offering and continue to sell or license this technology when the opportunity is in our best interest 
during fiscal  we completed equity financings for gross proceeds of approximately million 
as of march   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments of approximately million as compared to million at march  critical accounting policies estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual future results may differ from our estimates 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  valuation of inventories  and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in addition to evaluating estimates relating to the items discussed above  we also consider other estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  the valuation of inventories  income taxes  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates is included below under factors that may affect future results 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we defer recognition of new subscriber revenue from our packet service offerings until the acceptance period has expired 
new customers may terminate their service within thirty days of order placement and receive a full refund of fees previously paid 
as we have been providing our packet service for a limited period of time  we have not developed sufficient history to apply a return rate and reserve against new order revenue 
accordingly  we defer new subscriber revenue for thirty days to ensure that the thirty day acceptance period has expired 
emerging issues task force eitf consensus no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet specific criteria 
in addition  arrangement consideration must be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with certain limitations 
the provisioning of the packet service with the accompanying desktop terminal adapter or other customer premise equipment constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with the guidance of eitf no 
 we allocate packet revenues  including activation fees  among the customer premise equipment and subscriber services 
revenues allocated to the customer premise equipment are recognized as product revenues at the end of thirty days after order placement  provided the customer does not cancel their packet service 
all other revenues are recognized as license and service revenues when the related services are provided 
we defer the cost of goods sold of products sold for which the end customer or distributor has a right of return 
the cost of the products sold is recognized  contemporaneously with the recognition of revenue  when the subscriber has accepted the service 
at the time of each revenue transaction we assess whether the revenue amount is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are thirty to ninety days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
this means that we defer revenue from the arranged fee that is equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for our technology licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
we base the fair value of services  such as training or consulting  on separate sales of these services to other customers 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
if a software license arrangement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until we can objectively demonstrate that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria or when the customer has signed formal acceptance documentation 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  revenue is recognized on a subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
for all sales  except those completed via the internet  we use either a binding purchase order or other signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement  and recognize revenue upon settlement of the transaction  if there are no customer acceptance conditions 
we do not settle credit card transactions until equipment related to the transaction  if any  is shipped to a customer 
our ability to enter into revenue generating transactions and recognize revenue in the future is subject to a number of business and economic risks discussed below under factors that may affect future results 
collectibility of accounts receivable we must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  including historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounts receivable balance approximated million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of march   including a reserve for disputed credit card charges 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
valuation of inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions and replacement costs 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant management judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize most of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
litigation from time to time  we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
management s current estimated range of liability related to pending intellectual property and other litigation involving the company is based on claims and exposures for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
at march   liabilities related to litigation matters were not significant 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability  if any  related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statement of operations data for each of the years ended march   and  expressed as the percentage of our total revenues represented by each item 
cost of product revenues is presented as a percentage of product revenues and cost of license and other revenues is presented as a percentage of license and service revenues 
you should read this information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
year ended march  product revenues license and service revenues total revenues operating expenses cost of product revenues cost of license and service revenues research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring and other charges total operating expenses loss from operations other income  net loss before benefit for income taxes benefit for income taxes net loss revenues product revenues consist of revenues from sales of voip terminal adapters  telephones and videophones  primarily attributable to our packet service  as well as sales of voip semiconductors and other system products 
product revenues were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the million decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal million was primarily attributable to a million increase in packet product revenues attributable to the growth in the subscriber base compared to the prior year  partially offset by a million decrease in sales of video and voip semiconductors 
during fiscal  our packet lines in service increased from approximately  at march  to approximately  at march  the million decrease in product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million decline in sales of our semiconductor products  consisting of a million decrease in videoconferencing semiconductor sales combined with a  decrease in voip semiconductor sales 
the decrease in videoconferencing semiconductor sales was attributable to a decrease in unit shipments due to the end of life of those products and completion of final shipments of such products in the first quarter of fiscal total videoconferencing semiconductor product revenues were  and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in voip semiconductor revenue was attributable to a decrease in unit shipments combined with a decrease in average selling prices asps 
revenues from system products decreased approximately  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to decreases in sales of media hubs used with our hosted ipbx product and videophone sales offset by an increase in product revenues attributable to the packet service due to the growth in subscribers 
license and service revenues consist primarily of revenues attributable to our packet service and technology licenses and related maintenance revenues  as well as the royalties earned under such licenses 
we expect that packet service revenues will continue to comprise substantially all of our license and service revenues on a going forward basis 
prior to fiscal  our license and service revenues were primarily generated by nonrecurring transactions 
license and services revenues were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the million increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to a million increase in packet service revenues attributable to the growth in the subscriber base  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in license and maintenance revenues associated with our hosted ipbx product and ip semiconductor telephony technology 
the increase in license and service revenues of approximately million for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the following a million increase in revenues in fiscal related to the license and sale of the technology related to our next generation video semiconductor product to leadtek as compared to revenues recognized related to the development effort with leadtek in fiscal  which effort was terminated in fiscal in connection with the license and sale transaction  a million increase in revenues attributable to our ip semiconductor telephony technology  primarily attributable to a july license of the audacity t and tu semiconductor products and veracity software to a single customer  and a million increase in recurring service revenues attributable to our packet service 
these increases in license and service revenues were offset by a million reduction in revenues from the june sale of our video monitoring business  a  decrease in royalties earned from a single customer under a license agreement for our mpeg video compression technology  the final royalty revenues under this license agreement were received in the first quarter of fiscal  and a decrease of  in license and maintenance revenues associated with our hosted ipbx product 
revenues from our ten largest customers in the fiscal years ended march   and accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
no single customer represented more than of our total revenues during fiscal two customers represented and of our total revenues in fiscal we expect customer concentration to decrease in the future as revenues from our packet service increase as a percentage of overall revenues 
sales to customers outside the united states represented  and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the following table illustrates our net revenues by geographic area 
revenues are attributed to countries based on the destination of shipment in thousands year ended march  united states    europe   taiwan   japan other  cost of product revenues the cost of product revenues consists of costs associated with systems  components  system and semiconductor assembly and testing performed by third party vendors  estimated warranty obligations and direct and indirect costs associated with product purchasing  scheduling  quality assurance  shipping and handling 
the cost of product revenues was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
we generally do not charge packet subscribers for the terminal adapters used to provide our service when they subscribe on our website 
we have also offered incentives to customers who purchase terminal adapters in our retail channels to offset the cost of the equipment purchased from a retailer 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 a portion of packet revenues is allocated to product revenues  but these revenues are less than the cost of the terminal adapters 
accordingly  cost of product revenues exceeds product revenues  and we expect this trend to continue 
the million increase in the cost of product revenues in fiscal was primarily due to an approximately million increase attributable to equipment provided and sold to packet subscribers upon commencement of service and related manufacturing  personnel  handling  overhead and shipping costs 
the increase in packet expenses was partially offset by a decrease in cost of revenues for semiconductor products due to the decrease in sales of such products during fiscal due to the end of life of these products initiated in fiscal for the year ended march   we reversed  of write downs related to semiconductor product inventory that had been previously written down or for which we had recorded purchase commitment reserves due to the sale of the inventory 
in addition  we reversed approximately  of royalty and  of warranty reserves related to our former video semiconductor and pstn videophone products as a result of changes in estimates 
the million decrease in the cost of product revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a million decrease in cost of goods sold for semiconductor products  partially offset by a million increase for equipment provided and sold to packet subscribers upon commencement of service and related manufacturing  personnel  handling  overhead and shipping costs 
for the year ended march   we reversed  of write downs related to semiconductor product inventory due to the sale of the inventory  and recorded  of reserves against our non ip videophone product inventory 
we also reversed approximately  of warranty reserves related to our video monitoring business as a result of a change in estimate of our warranty exposure 
cost of license and service revenues the cost of license and service revenues consists of costs primarily associated with network operations and related personnel  telephony origination and termination services provided by third party carriers  and royalty expenses 
the cost of license and service revenues was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the million increase in cost of license and service revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in packet network operations  third party carrier service and other costs due to the year over year growth in the packet lines in service 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in license and royalty costs attributable to our ip semiconductor technology  primarily attributable to video semiconductor product development efforts during fiscal as the costs of developing this video semiconductor product related to a revenue generating contract  they were included in cost of license and service revenue in fiscal and fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we terminated this video semiconductor development effort in connection with the license and sale of the technology 
the million increase in cost of license and service revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in packet network operations  third party carrier service and other costs due to the year over year growth in the packet subscriber base and a million increase attributable to our ip semiconductor technology 
research and development expenses research and development expenses have historically consisted primarily of personnel  system prototype design and fabrication  mask  prototype wafer  and equipment costs necessary for us to conduct our development and engineering efforts 
research and development costs  including software development costs  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the million increase in research and development expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs due to additional employee and contractor headcount 
these increases were offset by decreases in depreciation  tooling and maintenance expenses 
the million decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a million reduction in compensation expense for personnel primarily attributable to headcount reductions arising from the sale of centile europe sa during fiscal  closure of our united kingdom uk office in late fiscal  and the transfer of employees to leadtek research  inc in connection with the sale and license of our next generation video chip technology  a million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense due to the end of life of certain assets and the asset write offs recorded in fiscal  and a million reduction in expenditures attributable to the closure of our uk office in late fiscal and the sale of centile europe sa in the second quarter of fiscal the reduction in centile europe sa expenses in france was partially offset by expenses attributable to x europe sarl  our new french subsidiary formed in the third quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  customer support  finance  human resources and general management 
such costs also include sales commissions  trade show  advertising and other marketing and promotional expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal  as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a million increase in compensation expense for personnel due to headcount additions  a million increase in advertising  public relations and other marketing and promotional expenses  a million increase in contractor expenses to the increase in staffing of our telemarketing and customer service organizations  a million increase in sales agent and retailer commissions  a million increase in consultant and auditor expenses related to compliance with sarbanes oxley section  a million increase in legal fees and a million increase in credit card transaction processing fees 
the million decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million reduction in compensation expense for personnel due to headcount reductions  a million reduction in facility related expenses for our headquarters due to a reduction of rent and operating expenses in the fist quarter of fiscal in connection with a lease extension and a million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense due to the end of life of certain assets 
the decreases were partially offset by a million increase in various other sales  general and administrative expenses including advertising  promotion and trade show expenses  legal expenditures  primarily related to intellectual property  regulatory and financing matters  and reseller commissions and credit card processing fees 
restructuring and other charges restructuring actions as a result of restructuring activities in fiscal  we recorded restructuring and other asset impairment charges of approximately million 
these charges included severance and benefits of approximately million  as we reduced our workforce  under voluntary and involuntary separation plans  by thirty two employees or thirty percent 
the majority of the affected employees were netergy employees based in santa clara  california and marlow  united kingdom and included employees from sales and marketing and research and development  as well as four executives of netergy 
severance of approximately  attributable to involuntary terminations was paid during the year ended march  we closed our facility in marlow  united kingdom  and recorded  of charges related to the termination of the operating leases for the facility and related services 
in addition  we recorded asset impairment charges of  related to assets in the united kingdom that were abandoned or disposed of 
we also recorded a charge of approximately  for our remaining lease liability for office space in tempe  arizona that was vacated as a result of the restructuring actions during the fourth quarter 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also implemented a plan to reduce the workforce at our sophia antipolis  france office by ten employees or seventy percent 
this downsizing and its potential impact on our ipbx business prompted an assessment of the key assumptions underlying our goodwill valuation judgments 
as a result of the analysis  we determined that an impairment charge of million was required because the estimated fair value of the goodwill was less than the book value of the goodwill that arose from the acquisition of odisei sa in fiscal the following table illustrates the charges  credits and balances of the restructuring reserves for the years ended march   and  and summarizes asset impairment charges in thousands liability liability liability total cash non cash at march  cash at march  cash at march  charges payments charges pa yments payments restructuring charges severance   facility related total restructuring charges   asset impairments fixed assets goodwill   total impairment charges   total restructuring and impairment charges    other income  net in fiscal  and  other income  net  was   and  respectively 
in fiscal  other income  net was primarily comprised of interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
the  decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to a  one time gain recorded in fiscal in connection with the sale of centile europe sa  partially offset by an increase in interest income of  due to higher cash balances maintained during the year and the receipt of escrow funds of  from a cost basis common stock investment in an entity acquired in by a third party 
the  increase in other income  net  in fiscal was primarily attributable to a  gain recorded in fiscal in connection with the sale of centile europe sa  which was offset by a decrease of  related to the canadian tax credits that we collected in fiscal and recorded as other income 
benefit for income taxes we had no provisions for the fiscal years ended march   and we recorded a  benefit in fiscal  which was primarily attributable to the release of income tax reserves recorded in prior years and  attributable to an income tax refund received by one of our foreign subsidiaries 
at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire at various dates beginning in and continuing through in addition  at march   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit carryforwards will begin expiring in continuing through  while the california credit will carryforward indefinitely 
under the ownership change limitations of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the amount and benefit from the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
at march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and million 
we believe that  based on a number of factors  the weight of objective available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets  and a full valuation allowance was recorded at march  and liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million in restricted cash  and million in investments in marketable securities for a combined total of million 
in comparison  at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in restricted cash and no investments for a combined total of million 
we currently have no borrowing arrangements 
our cash and cash equivalents balance increased million and the combined balance increased by million during fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to million of net proceeds from financing activities  partially offset by million used for operating activities  as discussed below 
our restricted cash balance decreased by million  as adjusted for million of restricted cash recorded on other assets on our consolidated balance sheet  due to termination of agreements requiring letters of credit 
the remaining amount is pledged as collateral for a stand by letter of credit issued by our primary bank 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal was primarily attributable to the net loss of million  adjusted for million of non cash depreciation and amortization  a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory and a million increase in deferred cost of goods sold 
cash used in operations was partially offset by a million increase in deferred revenue  a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to our development of the retail and distributor channels in fiscal combined with an increase in subscribers in fiscal  and the increase in inventory was primarily attributable to the growth of the packet service and ramping of production for desktop terminal adapters 
the increases in deferred cost of goods sold and deferred revenue were primarily attributable to the growth in subscribers in fiscal and the retail and distributor channels that we did not have in fiscal the increase in accounts payable was attributable to timing and an increase in payables for inventory and service provider costs 
cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal was primarily attributable to million of purchases of fixed assets and purchases of investments of million  partially offset by a net million decrease in cash classified as restricted cash due to the termination of agreements requiring letters of credit and million of proceeds received from maturities of investments 
the purchases of fixed assets were primarily attributable to equipment required by the growth of the packet subscriber base and expenditures for financial application and customer relationship management software and implementation fees 
cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in fiscal consisted primarily of million of net proceeds received from common stock offerings completed in june and october and march  and million of proceeds received from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal was primarily attributable to the net loss of million  adjusted for million of stock compensation expense  the  gain on the sale of centile europe and  of depreciation and amortization  a decrease in accrued compensation of  a decrease in warranty liability of  a  decrease in other accrued liabilities  and a  decrease in other assets 
cash used in operations was partially offset by a  decrease in accounts receivable  a  decrease in inventory  and a  increase in accounts payable 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to  of cash classified as restricted cash to support standby letters of credit with certain vendors and proceeds from the sale of fixed assets of  partially offset by the receipt of  of net proceeds from the sale of centile europe sa  and net sales of marketable equity securities and mutual funds of  cash provided by financing activities in fiscal consisted of million of proceeds resulting from the sale of common stock i to investors in private placement transactions in july and november the private placements  ii through exercise of warrants issued in the private placements  and iii to employees through our employee stock option plans 
at march   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
these purchase commitments are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods or services 
at march   future minimum annual lease payments under noncancelable operating leases  net of sublease income  were as follows in thousands year ending march  total minimum payments  we have sustained net losses and negative cash flows from operations since fiscal that have been funded primarily through the issuance of equity securities and borrowings 
management believes that current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to finance our operations for the next twelve months 
however  we continually evaluate our cash needs and may pursue additional equity or debt financing in order to achieve our overall business objectives 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available  or  if available  at a price or terms that are acceptable to us 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our longer term business objectives 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  requiring all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
this standard includes two transition methods 
upon adoption  we will be required to use either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  awards that are granted  modified  or settled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r 
unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
except that amounts must be recognized in the income statement 
under the modified retrospective approach  the previously reported amounts are restated either to the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented to reflect the sfas no 
amounts in the income statement 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which provides guidance regarding the application of sfas r 
sab expresses views of the sec regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r  share based payment  and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the sec s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in particular  sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with non employees  the transition from nonpublic to public entity status  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issued under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  first time adoption of sfas no

we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard and its transitional alternatives 
factors that may affect future results before you invest in our common stock  you should become aware of various risks  including those described below 
you should carefully consider these risk factors  together with all of the other information included in this prospectus  including the documents incorporated in this prospectus by reference  before you decide whether to purchase the securities 
the risks set out below may not be exhaustive 
we have a history of losses and we are uncertain as to our future profitability 
we recorded an operating loss of approximately million for the year ended march   and we ended the period with an accumulated deficit of million 
in addition  we recorded operating losses of million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
we expect that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future  and such losses may be substantial 
we will need to generate significant revenue growth to achieve an operating profit 
given our history of fluctuating revenues and operating losses  we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve profitability on either a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our stock price has been highly volatile 
the market price of the shares of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
it may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technical innovations  future legislation or regulation of the internet and or voice over internet protocol voip  loss of key personnel  new entrants into the voip service marketplace  including cable companies and other well capitalized competitors  new products or new contracts by us  our competitors or their customers  and developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general market conditions  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and other factors which could be unrelated to  or outside of  our control 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stocks of technology companies and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against the issuing company 
if our stock price is volatile  we may also be subject to such litigation 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would disrupt business and could cause a decline in our operating results 
any settlement or adverse determination in such litigation would also subject us to significant liability 
the growth of our business and our potential for future profitability depends on the growth of packet revenue 
we devote substantially all of our resources to the promotion  distribution and development of our packet service 
as such  our future growth and profitability is dependent on revenue from our packet service  as opposed to revenue from our semiconductor business  which has historically accounted for a substantial portion of the company s consolidated revenues 
semiconductor and related software revenues represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s consolidated revenues for fiscal and however  these revenues were not sufficient to profitably operate our semiconductor business 
therefore  we have significantly reduced the scope of these operations 
during the quarter ended june   we completed the end of life of our legacy videoconferencing semiconductor products 
in november  we sold the vip video semiconductor development effort to leadtek research  inc leadtek 
under the terms of the transaction  leadtek acquired the vip development activities  key engineers  software tools and equipment 
revenues attributable to this development effort  prior to the aforementioned transaction  were and million during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing approximately and of revenues of our semiconductor business and and of x s consolidated revenues for such periods 
as a result of the transfer of this development effort to leadtek  this development revenue ceased 
in january  we initiated an end of life program for our voip telephony semiconductor products  including the audacity t and tu products 
the semiconductor business may continue to generate revenue in the future  although we expect the amounts to decrease  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our consolidated revenues 
revenues from the hosted ipbx solutions business represented approximately and of the company s consolidated revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
in july  we sold our european subsidiary  centile europe sa  and licensed  on a non exclusive basis  our ipbx technology to the purchaser 
in march  we announced the packet virtual office service  which includes technologies previously offered as part of the hosted ipbx solutions business 
we have only been selling our packet service for a limited period and there is no guarantee that packet will gain broad market acceptance 
we have only been selling our packet service since november given our limited history with offering this service  there are many difficulties that we may encounter  including regulatory hurdles  discussed below  and other problems that we may not anticipate 
to date  we have not generated significant revenue from the sale of our voice over ip  or voip  telephony products and services  including our packet service  and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in generating significant revenues or achieving profitability 
if we are not able to generate significant revenues selling into the voip telephony market  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
if we are not able to retain a significant percentage of our current and future packet customers on an ongoing basis  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
the success of our packet service is dependent on the growth and public acceptance of voip telephony 
the success of our packet voice and video communications service is dependent upon future demand for voip telephony systems and services 
in order for the ip telephony market to continue to grow  several things need to occur 
telephone and cable service providers must continue to invest in the deployment of high speed broadband networks to residential and business customers 
voip networks must improve quality of service for real time communications  managing effects such as packet jitter  packet loss  and unreliable bandwidth  so that toll quality service can be provided 
voip telephony equipment and services must achieve a similar level of reliability that users of the public switched telephone network have come to expect from their telephone service 
voip telephony service providers must offer cost and feature benefits to their customers that are sufficient to cause the customers to switch away from traditional telephony service providers 
furthermore  end users in markets serviced by recently deregulated telecommunications providers are not familiar with obtaining services from competitors of these providers and may be reluctant to use new providers  such as us 
we will need to devote substantial resources to educate customers and end users about the benefits of voip telephony solutions in general and our services in particular 
if any or all of these factors fail to occur  our business may decline 
our future operating results may not follow past or expected trends due to many factors and any of these could cause our stock price to fall 
our historical operating results have fluctuated significantly and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future  and a decline in our operating results could cause our stock price to fall 
on an annual and a quarterly basis  there are a number of factors that may affect our operating results  many of which are outside our control 
these include  but are not limited to changes in market demand  the timing of customer orders  customer cancellations  competitive market conditions  lengthy sales cycles and or regulatory approval cycles  new product introductions by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new or existing products  the cost and availability of components  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of products sold  the management of inventory  the level of international sales  continued compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements  and general economic conditions 
in the likely event that we encounter significant price competition in the markets for our products  we could be at a significant disadvantage compared to our competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources  and therefore may be better able to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure 
the adverse impact of a shortfall in our revenues may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for such shortfall 
announcements by our competitors or us of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of our existing products  which would also have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
due to these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the price of our common stock would likely decline significantly 
the voip telephony market is subject to rapid technological change and we depend on new product and service introductions in order to maintain and grow our business 
voip telephony is an emerging market that is characterized by rapid changes in customer requirements  frequent introductions of new and enhanced products  and continuing and rapid technological advancement 
to compete successfully in this emerging market  we must continue to design  develop  manufacture  and sell new and enhanced voip telephony software products and services that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability at lower cost 
these new and enhanced products must take advantage of technological advancements and changes  and respond to new customer requirements 
our success in designing  developing  manufacturing  and selling such products and services will depend on a variety of factors  including the identification of market demand for new products  the scalability of our voip telephony software products  product and feature selection  timely implementation of product design and development  product performance  cost effectiveness of current products and services and products under development  our ability to successfully implement service features mandated by federal and state law  effective manufacturing processes  and effectiveness of promotional efforts 
additionally  we may also be required to collaborate with third parties to develop our products and may not be able to do so on a timely and cost effective basis  if at all 
we have in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and such delays will likely occur in the future 
if we are unable  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner  if such new or enhanced products do not achieve sufficient market acceptance  or if such new product introductions decrease demand for existing products  our operating results would decline and our business would not grow 
decreasing telecommunications rates may diminish or eliminate our competitive pricing advantage 
decreasing telecommunications rates may diminish or eliminate the competitive pricing advantage of our services 
international and domestic telecommunications rates have decreased significantly over the last few years in most of the markets in which we operate  and we anticipate that rates will continue to be reduced in all of the markets in which we do business or expect to do business 
users who select our services to take advantage of the current pricing differential between traditional telecommunications rates and our rates may switch to traditional telecommunications carriers as such pricing differentials diminish or disappear  and we will be unable to use such pricing differentials to attract new customers in the future 
in addition  our ability to market our services to other service providers depends upon the existence of spreads between the rates offered by us and the rates offered by traditional telecommunications carriers  as well as a spread between the retail and wholesale rates charged by the carriers from which we obtain wholesale services 
continued rate decreases will require us to lower our rates to remain competitive and will reduce or possibly eliminate any gross profit from our services 
if telecommunications rates continue to decline  we may lose subscribers for our services 
we are a small company with limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively and increase market share 
most of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and name recognition and a larger base of customers than we have 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours 
our competitors may also offer bundled service arrangements offering a more complete product despite the technical merits or advantages of our products 
these competitors include traditional telephone service providers  such as at t  sbc and verizon  cable television companies  such as cablevision  cox and time warner  and other voip service providers such as skype and vonage 
competition could decrease our prices  reduce our sales  lower our gross profits or decrease our market share 
our success depends on third parties in our distribution channels 
we currently sell our products direct to consumers and through resellers  and are focusing efforts on increasing our distribution channels 
our future revenue growth will depend in large part on sales of our products through reseller and other distribution relationships 
we may not be successful in developing additional distribution relationships 
agreements with distribution partners generally provide for one time and recurring commissions based on our list prices  and do not require minimum purchases or restrict development or distribution of competitive products 
therefore  entities that distribute our products may compete with us 
in addition  distributors and resellers may not dedicate sufficient resources or give sufficient priority to selling our products 
our failure to develop new distribution channels  the loss of a distribution relationship or a decline in the efforts of a material reseller or distributor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we need to retain key personnel to support our products and ongoing operations 
the development and marketing of our voip products will continue to place a significant strain on our limited personnel  management  and other resources 
our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan 
none of our officers or key employees are bound by employment agreements for any specific term 
the loss of the services of any of our officers or key employees could delay the development and introduction of  and negatively impact our ability to sell our products which could adversely affect our financial results and impair our growth 
we currently do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
we depend on contract manufacturers to manufacture substantially all of our products  and any delay or interruption in manufacturing by these contract manufacturers would result in delayed or reduced shipments to our customers and may harm our business 
we do not have long term purchase agreements with our contract manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that our contract manufacturers will be able or willing to reliably manufacture our products  in volumes  on a cost effective basis or in a timely manner 
for our videophones  cordless handsets and terminal adaptors that are used with our packet service  we rely on the availability of certain semiconductor products 
these devices are also sourced solely from certain overseas contract manufacturers and partners  and are currently not available from any other manufacturer 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we rely on third party network service providers to originate and terminate substantially all of our public switched telephone network calls 
our packet service depends on the availability of third party network service providers that provide telephone numbers and public switched telephone network pstn call termination and origination services for our customers 
many of these network service providers have been affected by the downturn in the telecommunications industry and may be forced to terminate the services that we depend on 
the time to interface our technology to another network service provider  if available  and qualify this new service could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
while we believe that relations with our current service providers are good and we have contracts in place  there can be no assurance that these service providers will be able or willing to supply cost effective services to us in the future or that we will be successful in signing up alternative or additional providers 
while we believe that we could replace our current providers  if necessary  our ability to provide service to our subscribers would be impacted during this timeframe  and this could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the loss of access to  or requirement to change  the telephone numbers we provide to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to manage our inventory levels effectively  which may lead to inventory obsolescence that would force us to incur inventory write downs 
our products have lead times of up to several months  and are built to forecasts that are necessarily imprecise 
because of our practice of building our products to necessarily imprecise forecasts  it is likely that  from time to time  we will have either excess or insufficient product inventory 
excess inventory levels would subject us to the risk of inventory obsolescence  while insufficient levels of inventory may negatively affect relations with customers 
for instance  our customers rely upon our ability to meet committed delivery dates  and any disruption in the supply of our products could result in legal action from our customers  loss of customers or harm to our ability to attract new customers 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
if our products do not interoperate with our customers networks  orders for our products will be delayed or canceled and substantial product returns could occur  which could harm our business 
many of the potential customers for our packet service have requested that our products and services be designed to interoperate with their existing networks  each of which may have different specifications and use multiple standards 
our customers networks may contain multiple generations of products from different vendors that have been added over time as their networks have grown and evolved 
our products must interoperate with these products as well as with future products in order to meet our customers requirements 
in some cases  we may be required to modify our product designs to achieve a sale  which may result in a longer sales cycle  increased research and development expense  and reduced operating margins 
if our products do not interoperate with existing equipment or software in our customers networks  installations could be delayed  orders for our products could be canceled or our products could be returned 
in addition  contractual obligations may require us to continue to provide services that interoperate whether cost effective or in our interests 
any of these factors could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may have difficulty identifying the source of the problem when there is a problem in a network 
our packet service must successfully integrate with products from other vendors  such as gateways to traditional telephone systems 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether caused by our packet service or another vendor s products  may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may force us to incur significant expenses 
the occurrence of some of these types of problems may seriously harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
intense competition in the markets in which we compete could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenue and prevent us from achieving profitability we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products or new technologies 
if our competitors successfully introduce new products or enhance their existing products  this could reduce the sales or market acceptance of our products and services  increase price competition or make our products obsolete 
for instance  our competitors  such as local exchange carriers and cable television providers  may be able to bundle services and products that we do not offer together with long distance or voip telephony services 
these services could include wireless communications  voice and data services  internet access and cable television 
this form of bundling would put us at a competitive disadvantage if these providers can combine a variety of services offerings at a single attractive price 
to be competitive  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing  and customer support 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments or to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive  which in turn will cause our business to suffer 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  are substantially larger  and have greater financial  manufacturing  marketing  technical  and other resources 
many also have greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
competition in our markets may result in significant price reductions 
as a result of their greater resources  many current and potential competitors may be better able than us to initiate and withstand significant price competition or downturns in the economy 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively  and any failure to do so would harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
if we do not develop and maintain successful partnerships for voip telephony products  we may not be able to successfully market our solutions 
we are entering into new market areas and our success is partly dependent on our ability to forge new marketing and engineering partnerships 
voip telephony communication systems are extremely complex and few  if any  companies possess all the required technology components needed to build a complete end to end solution 
we will likely need to enter into partnerships to augment our development programs and to assist us in marketing complete solutions to our targeted customers 
we may not be able to develop such partnerships in the course of our product development 
even if we do establish the necessary partnerships  we may not be able to adequately capitalize on these partnerships to aid in the success of our business 
inability to protect our proprietary technology or our infringement of a third party s proprietary technology would disrupt our business 
we rely in part on trademark  copyright  and trade secret law to protect our intellectual property in the united states and abroad 
we seek to protect our software  documentation  and other written materials under trade secret and copyright law  which afford only limited protection 
we also rely in part on patent law to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally 
we hold fifty eight united states patents and have a number of united states and foreign patent applications pending 
we cannot predict whether such pending patent applications will result in issued patents that effectively protect our intellectual property 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in the united states or internationally where effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited  and competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around any patent of ours 
we have in the past licensed and in the future expect to continue licensing our technology to others  many of whom are located or may be located abroad 
there are no assurances that such licensees will protect our technology from misappropriation 
moreover  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
any settlement or adverse determination in such litigation would also subject us to significant liability 
there has been substantial litigation in the communications  semiconductor  electronics  and related industries regarding intellectual property rights  and from time to time third parties may claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights 
our broad range of technology  including systems  digital and analog circuits  software  and semiconductors  increases the likelihood that third parties may claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights 
if we were found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of any third party  we could be subject to liabilities for such infringement  which could be material 
we could also be required to refrain from using  manufacturing or selling certain products or using certain processes  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive in the future  notices of claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that we will prevail in these discussions and actions or that other actions alleging infringement by us of third party patents will not be asserted or prosecuted against us 
we rely upon certain technology  including hardware and software  licensed from third parties 
there can be no assurance that the technology licensed by us will continue to provide competitive features and functionality or that licenses for technology currently utilized by us or other technology which we may seek to license in the future will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  existing licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent technology or suitable alternative products could be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  and could harm our business 
these licenses are on standard commercial terms made generally available by the companies providing the licenses 
the cost and terms of these licenses individually are not material to our business 
the failure of ip networks to meet the reliability and quality standards required for voice and video communications could render our products obsolete 
circuit switched telephony networks feature very high reliability  with a guaranteed quality of service 
in addition  such networks have imperceptible delay and consistently satisfactory audio quality 
emerging broadband ip networks  such as lans  wans  and the internet  or emerging last mile technologies such as cable  digital subscriber lines  and wireless local loop  may not be suitable for telephony unless such networks and technologies can provide reliability and quality consistent with these standards 
our products must comply with industry standards  fcc regulations  state  local  country specific and international regulations  and changes may require us to modify existing products and or services 
in addition to reliability and quality standards  the market acceptance of telephony over broadband ip networks is dependent upon the adoption of industry standards so that products from multiple manufacturers are able to communicate with each other 
our voip telephony products rely heavily on communication standards such as sip  h  mgcp and megaco and network standards such as tcp ip and udp to interoperate with other vendors equipment 
there is currently a lack of agreement among industry leaders about which standard should be used for a particular application  and about the definition of the standards themselves 
these standards  as well as audio and video compression standards  continue to evolve 
we also must comply with certain rules and regulations of the federal communications commission fcc regarding electromagnetic radiation and safety standards established by underwriters laboratories  as well as similar regulations and standards applicable in other countries 
standards are continuously being modified and replaced 
as standards evolve  we may be required to modify our existing products or develop and support new versions of our products 
we must comply with certain federal  state and local requirements regarding how we interact with our customers  including consumer protection  privacy and billing issues  the provision of emergency service and the quality of service we provide to our customers 
the failure of our products and services to comply  or delays in compliance  with various existing and evolving standards could delay or interrupt volume production of our voip telephony products  subject us to fines or other imposed penalties  or harm the perception and adoption rates of our service  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
our ability to offer services outside the us is subject to the local regulatory environment  which may be unknown  complicated and often uncertain 
regulatory treatment of voip telephony outside the united states varies from country to country 
we currently distribute our products and services directly to consumers and through resellers that may be subject to telecommunications regulations in their home countries 
the failure of these consumers and resellers to comply with these laws and regulations could reduce our revenue and profitability 
because of our relationship with the resellers  some countries may assert that we are required to register as a telecommunications carrier in that country 
in such case  our failure to do so could subject us to fines or penalties 
in addition  some countries are considering subjecting voip services to the regulations applied to traditional telephone companies 
regulatory developments such as these could have a material adverse effect on our international operation 
in many countries in which we operate or our services are sold  the status of the laws that may relate to our services is unclear 
we cannot be certain that our customers  resellers  or other affiliates are currently in compliance with regulatory or other legal requirements in their respective countries  that they or we will be able to comply with existing or future requirements  and or that they or we will continue to be in compliance with any such requirements 
our failure or the failure of those with whom we transact business to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
future legislation or regulation of the internet and or voice and video over ip services could restrict our business  prevent us from offering service or increase our cost of doing business 
at present there are few laws  regulations or rulings that specifically address access to commerce and communications services on the internet  including ip telephony 
we are unable to predict the impact  if any  that future legislation  legal decisions or regulations concerning the internet may have on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
regulation may be targeted towards  among other things  assessing access or settlement charges  imposing taxes related to internet communications and imposing tariffs or regulations based on encryption concerns or the characteristics and quality of products and services  any of which could restrict our business or increase our cost of doing business 
the increasing growth of the broadband ip telephony market and popularity of broadband ip telephony products and services heighten the risk that governments or other legislative bodies will seek to regulate broadband ip telephony and the internet 
in addition  large  established telecommunication companies may devote substantial lobbying efforts to influence the regulation of the broadband ip telephony market  which may be contrary to our interests 
many regulatory actions are underway or are being contemplated by federal and state authorities  including the fcc and other state and local regulatory agencies 
on february   the fcc initiated a notice of public rule making to update fcc policy and consider the appropriate regulatory classification for voip and other ip enabled services 
on november   the fcc ruled that vonage digitalvoice and similar services are jurisdictionally interstate and not subject to state certification  tariffing and other common carrier regulations  including this ruling has been subsequently appealed by several states 
on february   the california public utilities commission cpuc initiated an investigation into voice over ip providers  including us 
as a tentative conclusion of law  the cpuc stated that they believe that voip providers are telecommunications providers and should be treated as such from a regulatory standpoint 
there is risk that a regulatory agency requires us to conform to rules that are unsuitable for ip communications technologies or rules that cannot be complied with due to the nature and efficiencies of ip routing  or are unnecessary or unreasonable in light of the manner in which packet offers service to its customers 
it is not possible to separate the internet  or any service offered over it  into intrastate and interstate components 
while suitable alternatives may be developed in the future  the current ip network does not enable us to identify the geographic nature of the traffic traversing the internet 
the effects of federal  state or municipal regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
several us states and municipalities have recently shown an interest in regulating voip services  as they do for providers of traditional telephone service 
if this trend continues  and if state regulation is not preempted by action by the us federal government  we may become subject to a patchwork quilt of state regulations and taxes  which would increase our costs of doing business  and adversely affect our operating results and future prospects 
we have already been contacted by several state regulatory authorities regarding our packet service 
on september   we received a letter from the public service commission of wisconsin  or wpsc  notifying us that the wpsc believes that we  via our packet voice and video communications service  are offering intrastate telecommunications services in the state of wisconsin without certification of the wpsc 
according to the wpsc s letter  it believes that we cannot legally provide packet based resold intrastate services in wisconsin without certification from the wpsc 
in addition  the commission believes that packet bills for intrastate services to wisconsin customers are void and not collectible 
the letter also states that if we do not obtain certification to offer intrastate telecommunications services  the matter will be referred to the state of wisconsin attorney general for enforcement action 
the letter also states that even if the company were certified by the wpsc  the previous operation without certification may still subject the company to referral to the state of wisconsin attorney general for enforcement action and possible forfeitures 
we consulted with counsel and have responded to the wpsc and disputed their assertions 
while we do not believe that the potential amounts of any forfeitures would be material to us  if we are subject to an enforcement action  we may become subject to liabilities and may incur expenses that adversely affect our results of operations 
on september   we were contacted by the ohio public utilities commission  or opuc  and asked to respond to a questionnaire on voice over ip technologies that the opuc is conducting 
the opuc inquired as to the nature of our service  how it is provided  and to what ohio residents the service is made available 
the questionnaire did not contain any assertions regarding the legality of the packet service under ohio law or any statements as to whether the opuc believes we are subject to regulation by the state of ohio 
we responded to this questionnaire on october  on september   the california public utilities commission  or cpuc  sent us a letter that alleged that we are offering intrastate telecommunications services for profit in california without having received formal certification from the cpuc to provide such service 
the cpuc also requested that we file an application with the cpuc for authority to conduct business as a telecommunications utility no later than october  after consultation with regulatory counsel  we responded to the cpuc  disputed its assertions and did not file the requested application 
in our october  response to the cpuc  we disagreed with the cpuc s classification of us as a telephone corporation under the california public utilities code 
we asserted that we are an information services provider and not a telecommunications provider 
the letter from the cpuc did not indicate  and we cannot predict  what any potential penalties or consequences in failing to obtain certification might be 
if we are subjected to penalties  or if we are required to comply with cpuc regulations affecting telecommunications service providers  our business may be adversely affected 
on november   the cpuc held a hearing in san francisco to hear testimony from cpuc staff and industry representatives regarding what course of action the cpuc should take with respect to internet telephony 
a representative from x testified at the hearing 
on february   the cpuc stated that  as a tentative conclusion of law  they believe that voip providers are telecommunications providers and should be treated as such from a regulatory standpoint 
the cpuc initiated an investigation into appropriate regulation of voip providers under state law  and acknowledged that it has not enforced the same regulatory regime over voip as applies to telecommunications services 
the cpuc is considering a number of potential regulatory requirements  including contribution to state universal service programs  provisioning of services  payment of access charges to interconnect with the pstn and compliance with nanp protocols and basic consumer protection laws  including california s telecommunications bill of rights 
the cpuc is also considering whether exempting voip providers from requirements applicable to traditional providers of voice telephony creates unfair competitive advantages that should be proactively addressed  if the regulatory framework governing the provision of voip should vary based on the market served and whether voip providers should be subject to the current system of intercompany compensation arrangements 
the cpuc has indicated that this process could last up to months  but there is no way for us to predict the timetable or outcome of this process 
on april   the cpuc instituted a rulemaking to assess and revise the regulation of all telecommunications utilities in california except for small incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs 
the primary goal of this proceeding is to develop a uniform regulatory framework for all telecommunications utilities  except small ilecs  to the extent that it is feasible and in the public interest to do so 
while not specifically directed at voip  it is unclear at this time what impact this new rulemaking will have on the cpucs classification or treatment of voip services 
in may  in response to a complaint case brought by frontier telephone of rochester against vonage  the new york state public service commission  or nypsc  concluded that vonage is a telephone corporation as defined by new york law and must obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity  which represents the authorization of the nypsc to provide telephone service in new york 
the nypsc will allow a forty five day period in which vonage can identify and seek waivers of any rules that it believes should not apply 
vonage will be required to provide service in some form  and will be required to file a schedule of its rates 
currently  this decision applies only to vonage 
in june  a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the nypsc from regulating vonage as a telecommunications carrier 
vonage has asked the federal district court to make this a permanent injunction  and this request is being considered 
while this ruling applies only to vonage and not to us  if we are subject to regulation by the nypsc  we may become subject to liabilities and may incur expenses that adversely affect our results of operations 
in july  we received a letter from the arizona corporation commission  or acc  stating that it was conducting a competitive analysis of the various telecommunications markets in arizona 
the letter requested that we provide answers to a listing of questions as well as certain data 
on august   after executing the acc s standard protective agreement governing the submission of commercially sensitive information  we sent to the acc answers to some of the questions posed in the initial letter  together with information responsive to certain of the data requests 
inasmuch as the acc proceeding is a generic docket opened for the purpose of gathering information regarding voip  additional information requests are possible  but none has been received to date 
in late and early  we received notices from multiple municipalities in california that the packet service is subject to utility user taxes  as defined in the respective municipal codes 
the notices require that we begin collecting and remitting utility user taxes no later than january  we have responded to these municipalities and disputed their assertions 
in january  we received a letter from an association representing multiple municipalities in south carolina asserting that we are subject to a business license tax applied to telecommunications companies 
we have responded to this association and disputed their assertion 
in may  we began charging a regulatory recovery fee  currently an additional per month  on each telephone number that is used by our customers  including toll free and virtual numbers 
the regulatory recovery fee is charged monthly to offset costs incurred by us in complying with inquiries and obligations imposed by federal  state and municipal regulatory bodies governments and the related legal and billing expenses 
this fee is not a tax or charge required or assessed by any government 
in may  we received a notice from the city of chicago that we were being investigated for non compliance with chicago tax laws as we are not collecting and remitting chicago s telecommunications tax 
we are working with counsel to formulate a response to dispute the applicability of this tax to the packet service 
we may be subject to liabilities for past sales and our future sales may decrease 
in accordance with current industry practice  we do not collect state and federal telecommunications taxes  other than federal excise tax  or fet  or other telecommunications surcharges with respect to our packet service 
we do not collect value added tax  or vat  for services that we provide to customers in european union  or eu  member countries 
future expansion of our packet service  along with other aspects of our evolving business  may result in additional sales and other tax obligations 
one or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on out of jurisdiction companies that provide telephone service 
a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales  decrease our ability to compete with traditional telephone companies  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
potential regulation of internet service providers could adversely affect our operations 
to date  the fcc has treated internet service providers as information service providers 
information service providers are currently exempt from federal and state regulations governing common carriers  including the obligation to pay access charges and contribute to the universal service fund 
the fcc is currently examining the status of internet service providers and the services they provide 
if the fcc were to determine that internet service providers  or the services they provide  are subject to fcc regulation  including the payment of access charges and contribution to the universal service funds  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
there may be risks associated with the lack of emergency dialing or the limitations associated with e emergency dialing with the packet service 
in may  the fcc unanimously adopted an order and notice of proposed rulemaking  or nprm  that requires voip providers to provide emergency  or e  service 
on june   the fcc released the text of the first report and order and notice of proposed rulemaking in the voip e proceeding  or the voip e order 
as a result of the voip e order  voip service providers that interconnect to the pstn  or interconnected voip providers  will be required to mimic the emergency calling capabilities offered by traditional landline phone companies 
all interconnected voip providers must deliver calls to the appropriate local public safety answering point  or psap  along with call back number and location  where the psap is able to receive that information 
e must be included in the basic service offering  it cannot be an optional or extra feature 
the psap delivery obligation  along with call back number and location information must be provided regardless of whether the service is fixed or nomadic 
user registration of location is permissible initially  although the fcc is committed to an advanced form of e that will determine user location without user intervention  one of the topics of the further nprm to be released eventually 
the voip e order mandates that existing and prospective customers must be notified of the capabilities and limitations of voip service with respect to emergency calling  and interconnected voip providers must obtain and maintain affirmative acknowledgement from each customer that the customer has read and understood the notice of limitations and distribute warning labels or stickers alerting consumers and other potential users of the limitations of voip service to each new subscriber prior to the initiation of service 
in addition  an interconnected voip provider must make it possible for customers to update their address ie  change their registered location via at least one option that requires no equipment other than that needed to access the voip service 
all interconnected voip providers must comply with the requirements of the voip e order within one hundred and twenty days of the publication of the voip e order in the federal register  which is expected by late june  with the exception that the customer notification obligations must be complied with within thirty days of the publication 
we currently offer e service as an option to packet subscribers who choose phone numbers in markets where e service is available our e service is only available in a subset of the markets where we provide telephone numbers 
we primarily market the packet service to our residential customers as a secondary line service  not a primary line service 
we do not encourage our residential customers to use packet as their only telephone service  unless they provision packet e service on the telephone line 
even with e provisioned  the ip dialtone service provided by packet is only as reliable as a customer s underlying broadband data service and internet service provider neither service is provided by us  and may not be suitable for use in all emergency situations 
for customers who choose not to or are unable to subscribe to our e service  we currently play a recorded message in response to customers who dial from these lines instructing them to hang up and either dial their local police fire department directly from the phone on the packet service  or to dial from a phone connected to the traditional telephone network 
the voip e order will increase our cost of doing business and may adversely affect our ability to deliver the packet service to new and existing customers in all geographic regions 
we cannot guarantee that e service will be available to all of our subscribers 
the voip e order or follow on orders or clarifications could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may lose customers if we experience system failures that significantly disrupt the availability and quality of the services that we provide 
the operation of our packet service depends on our ability to avoid and mitigate any interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers 
interruptions in service or performance problems  for whatever reason  could undermine confidence in our services and cause us to lose customers or make it more difficult to attract new ones 
in addition  because our services may be critical to the businesses of our customers  any significant interruption in service could result in lost profits or other liability to our customers 
although we attempt to disclaim liability in our service agreements  a court might not enforce a limitation on liability  which could expose us to financial loss 
in addition  we may provide our customers with guaranteed service level commitments 
if we are unable to meet these guaranteed service level commitments as a result of service interruptions  we may be obligated to provide credits  generally in the form of free service for a short period of time  to our customers  which could negatively affect our operating results 
consumer access to our websites directly affects our ability to sign new subscribers and the account management and reseller reporting services we offer and thus affects our service revenues 
we experience occasional system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to our customers and resellers  which may reduce our service revenues and the attractiveness of our products and services 
if we are unable to continually add additional software and hardware and upgrade our systems and network infrastructure in an effective manner  it could cause service interruption and adversely affect our ability to deliver the packet service 
the failure of any equipment or facility on our network  or those of our partners or customers  could result in the interruption of customer service until necessary repairs are made or replacement equipment is installed 
network failures  delays and errors could also result from natural disasters  terrorist acts  power losses  security breaches and computer viruses 
these failures  faults or errors could cause delays  service interruptions  expose us to customer liability or require expensive modifications that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our success depends on our ability to handle a large number of simultaneous calls  which our network may not be able to accommodate 
we expect the volume of simultaneous calls to increase significantly as the packet subscriber base grows 
our network hardware and software may not be able to accommodate this additional volume 
if we fail to maintain an appropriate level of operating performance  or if our service is disrupted  our reputation could be hurt  we could lose customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could be liable for breaches of security on our web site  fraudulent activities of our users  or the failure of third party vendors to deliver credit card transaction processing services 
a fundamental requirement for operating an internet based  worldwide voice and video communications service and electronically billing our packet customers is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches  failure to mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results 
the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled 
we rely on third party providers to process and guarantee payments made by packet subscribers up to certain limits  and we may be unable to prevent our customers from fraudulently receiving goods and services 
our liability risk will increase if a larger fraction of our packet transactions involve fraudulent or disputed credit card transactions 
any costs we incur as a result of fraudulent or disputed transactions could harm our business 
in addition  the functionality of our current billing system relies on certain third party vendors delivering services 
if these vendors are unable or unwilling to provide services  we will not be able to charge for our packet services in a timely or scalable fashion  which could significantly decrease our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have experienced losses due to subscriber fraud and theft of service 
subscribers have obtained access to the packet service without paying for monthly service and international toll calls by unlawfully using our authorization codes and submitting fraudulent credit card information 
to date  such losses from unauthorized credit card transactions and theft of service have not been significant 
we have implemented anti fraud procedures in order to control losses relating to these practices  but these procedures may not be adequate to effectively limit all of our exposure in the future from fraud 
if our procedures are not effective  consumer fraud and theft of service could significantly decrease our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
intellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent us from using necessary technology to provide ip voice and video services 
while we do not know of any technologies that are patented by others that we believe are necessary for us to provide our services  certain necessary technology may in fact be patented by other parties either now or in the future 
if such technology were held under patent by another person  we would have to negotiate a license for the use of that certain technology 
we may not be able to negotiate such a license at a price that is acceptable 
the existence of such a patent  or our inability to negotiate a license for any such technology on acceptable terms  could force us to cease using such technology and offering products and services incorporating such technology 
if we discover product defects  we may have product related liabilities which may cause us to lose revenues or delay market acceptance of our products 
products as complex as those we offer frequently contain errors  defects  and functional limitations when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced such errors  defects or functional limitations 
we sell products into markets that are extremely demanding of robust  reliable  fully functional products 
therefore  delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of such products  which could damage our credibility with our customers and adversely affect our ability to retain our existing customers and to attract new customers 
moreover  such errors  defects or functional limitations could cause problems  interruptions  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers 
alleviating such problems may require significant expenditures of capital and resources by us 
despite our testing  our suppliers or our customers may find errors  defects or functional limitations in new products after commencement of commercial production 
this could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  product repair or replacement costs  claims by our customers or others against us  or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
we will likely need to raise additional capital to support our operations 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments of approximately million 
unless we achieve and maintain profitability  we will need to raise additional capital 
we may not be able to obtain such additional financing as needed on acceptable terms  or at all  which may require us to reduce our operating costs and other expenditures  including reductions of personnel and capital expenditures 
if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced and they may experience significant dilution 
new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if we are not successful in these actions  we may be forced to cease operations 
we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq smallcap market  which has certain compliance requirements for continued listing of common stock 
if our minimum closing bid price per share falls below for a period of consecutive business days in the future  we may again be subject to delisting procedures 
as of the close of business on may   our common stock had a closing bid price of per share 
we must also meet additional continued listing requirements contained in nasdaq marketplace rule c b  which requires that we have a minimum of  in stockholders equity or  market value of listed securities or  of net income from continuing operations for the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the three most recently completed fiscal years 
as of may   based on our closing price as of that day  the market value of our securities approximated million and we were in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c b 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the continued listing requirements 
delisting could reduce the ability of our shareholders to purchase or sell shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically 
for instance  failure to obtain listing on another market or exchange may make it more difficult for traders to sell our securities 
broker dealers may be less willing or able to sell or make a market in our common stock 
not maintaining our nasdaq smallcap listing may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock  lessen interest by institutions and individuals in investing in our common stock  make it more difficult to obtain analyst coverage  and make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place  we are still exposed to potential risks from recent legislation requiring companies to periodically evaluate internal controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have evaluated our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  as required by this legislation 
we are required to perform the system and process evaluation and testing and any necessary remediation required in an effort to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our system of internal controls as of the end of each fiscal year 
our independent auditors must then attest to and report on that assessment by our management to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act section 
as a result  we have and expect to continue to incur significant additional expenses and diversion of management s time towards section compliance 
in any fiscal year  we may fail to timely complete our evaluation  testing and remediation actions in order to allow for this assessment by our management or our independent auditors may not be able to timely attest to our management s assessment 
if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the securities exchange commission or the nasdaq smallcap market 
further  if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented  designed  operated or reviewed  they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue a qualified report identifying a material weakness in our internal controls 
any such action could adversely affect our financial results and could cause our stock price to decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency our financial market risk consists primarily of risks associated with international operations and related foreign currencies 
we derive a portion of our revenues from customers in europe and asia 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  the vast majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  almost all of our arrangements with our contract manufacturers are denominated in us dollars 
we have a foreign subsidiary and are exposed to market risk from changes in exchange rates 
we have not entered into any currency hedging activities 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant  however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future 
investments we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
part of this portfolio includes investments in bank issues  corporate bonds and commercial papers
