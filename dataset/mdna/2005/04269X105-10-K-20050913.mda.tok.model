item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements about our expectations related to realizing new revenue streams and obtaining future collaboration agreements that include milestone and or royalty payments  our ability to realize such milestone and royalty payments under our existing or any future agreements  the success of our internal proprietary drug discovery activities  future research and development spending  our working capital requirements and our future headcount requirements 
these statements involve significant risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and those described more fully under the caption risk factors above and in other reports filed by array biopharma with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview array biopharma is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted small molecule drugs to treat life threatening and debilitating diseases 
our proprietary drug development pipeline is primarily focused on the treatment of cancer and inflammatory disease and includes clinical candidates that are designed to regulate therapeutically important targets 
in addition  leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies collaborate with array to discover and develop drug candidates across a broad range of therapeutic areas 
we have identified multiple drug candidates in our own proprietary programs and in collaborations with other drug companies 
we intend to progress our proprietary drug programs internally through clinical testing and continue to evaluate select programs for out licensing opportunities with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners 
to date  we have advanced four programs we wholly own erbb egfr cancer  in which the lead compound  arry  is expected to begin a phase i clinical trial in the fall of mek inflammation  in which the lead compound is in regulated safety assessment testing  and p inflammation and erbb cancer  which have compounds in preclinical development 
in addition  we have out licensed proprietary cancer programs to astrazeneca plc arry  which is currently in phase ib clinical trials  and genentech  inc  which involves two early stage programs 
we have built our drug development pipeline  and our discovery and development capabilities  primarily through cash flow from collaborations and through sales of our equity securities 
through june   we have recognized million in research funding  and we have generated million in up front payments and million in milestone payments from our collaborators and out licensing partners 
under our existing collaboration agreements  we have the potential to earn over million in additional milestone payments if we achieve all of the drug discovery objectives under these agreements  as well as royalties on any resulting product sales from different programs 
in december  we raised approximately million in a follow on public offering of our common stock 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the near future as we continue to invest in our proprietary drug discovery programs 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
revenue 
we generate revenue through the out licensing of select proprietary drug discovery programs for license and up front fees  research funding  based on the number of full time equivalents contractually assigned to the program  and research and development milestone payments 
we also have the potential to generate revenue from royalties on future product sales 
four programs have been out licensed to date  and we have received up front license fees of million in total from astrazeneca  genentech and amgen inc we also generate revenue through collaborations aimed at inventing drug candidates for our collaborators 
we receive research funding or collaboration revenue based on the number of full time equivalent employees contractually assigned to a program  plus related research expenses 
under certain of these agreements  we are entitled to receive additional payments based on the achievement of research milestones  drug development milestones and or royalties based on sales of products created as a result of these collaborations 
we sell our optimer building blocks  which are the starting materials used to create more complex chemical compounds in the drug discovery process  on a per compound basis without any restrictions on use 
in addition  we have licensed our lead generation libraries  which are a collection of structurally related chemical compounds that may have the potential of becoming drug candidates  on a non exclusive basis to our collaborators for their internal research purposes 
we are no longer developing new lead generation libraries other than for our proprietary research 
under our existing agreements  we retain all other rights to the compounds  which permits us to license the same compounds to other collaborators 
some of our existing lead generation library agreements allow our collaborators to obtain exclusive rights to commercialize particular compounds upon the payment of additional fees 
for the fiscal years   and  lead generation library revenue represented  and  respectively  of total revenue 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold compounds representing the remaining net book value of lead generation library inventory to a single major biotechnology company 
future revenue from any sales of compounds in our lead generation library is not expected to be significant 
we report revenue for lead generation and lead optimization research  custom synthesis and process research  the development and sale of chemical compounds and the co development of proprietary drug candidates we out license  as collaboration revenue 
license and milestone revenue is combined and reported separately from collaboration revenue 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from fees under our collaboration agreements on a monthly basis as work is performed 
per compound revenue is recognized as compounds are shipped 
revenue from license fees and up front fees are non refundable and are recognized on a straight line basis over the expected period of the related research program 
payments received in advance of performance are recorded as advance payments from collaborators until the revenue is earned 
milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue over the expected period of the related research program 
a portion of any milestone payment is recognized at the date the milestone is achieved which is determined using the applicable percentage of the research term that has elapsed at the date the milestone is achieved 
any balance is recognized ratably over the remaining research term 
revenue recognition related to license fees  up front payments and milestone payments could be accelerated in the event of early termination of programs 
customer concentration 
our top collaborators contributed over of our total revenue for fiscal and our top three collaborators  genentech  astrazeneca and intermune  inc  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
during fiscal  astrazeneca  genentech and eli lilly and company accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
in general  our collaborators may terminate their collaboration agreements with us on to days prior notice 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits and other collaboration related costs  including research and development conducted for our collaborators  supplies  small tools  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs 
fine chemicals consumed as well as any required inventory reserve adjustments are also recorded as cost of revenue 
we review the level and value of our chemical inventories periodically and  when required  write down the carrying cost of our inventories for non marketability to estimated net realizable value through an appropriate reserve 
research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery 
research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery consists of all costs associated with our proprietary drug development pipeline  including salaries and benefits  consulting and outsourced services  laboratory supplies  and allocated facility costs and depreciation 
when an internal proprietary program is out licensed  all subsequent costs of the out licensed program are reported as cost of revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and associated fringe benefits not included in cost of revenue or research and development expenses and include other management  business development  accounting  information technology and administration costs  including patent prosecution  recruiting and relocation  consulting and professional services  travel and meals  advertising  sales commissions  facilities  depreciation and other office expenses 
in addition  termination related costs of approximately  associated with a reduction in workforce completed in march were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal year business development 
we currently license or sell our compounds and enter into collaborations directly with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through opportunities identified by our business development group  senior management  scientists and customer referrals 
in addition  we license or sell our compounds and collaborations in japan through an agent 
international revenue represented of our total revenue during fiscal year  up from for fiscal year our international revenue is primarily attributable to both european and japanese collaborations and increased in fiscal over the prior year due to the collaboration and out licensing agreement with astrazeneca that we initiated in december all of our collaboration agreements and purchase orders are denominated in united states dollars 
future outlook 
we plan to increase our investment in proprietary research to broaden our product pipeline and advance drugs further in clinical development 
array will consider commercializing select programs with appropriate market characteristics while continuing to evaluate out licensing opportunities to maximize their risk adjusted return 
as part of these efforts  we expect near term selling  general and administrative costs to rise in connection with increased patent and other intellectual property related costs incurred to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in our proprietary programs 
as we devote more scientists to our proprietary research  we expect fewer scientists will be assigned to revenue generating collaborations 
in addition  we will recognize approximately  each month in revenue through november from previously received up front and milestone payments from out licensed proprietary programs 
because of our strategy to retain other proprietary programs later in clinical development before out licensing them or commercializing them ourselves  it is unlikely that this revenue will be replaced in our statements about future events in this paragraph are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including many that are beyond our control 
these risks are described more fully under the caption risk factors included herein and in other reports filed by array biopharma with the securities and exchange commission 
deferred stock compensation we recorded compensation expense related to stock option grants of approximately  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the compensation expense related to stock option grants is charged to cost of revenue  research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses  based on the functional responsibility of the associated employee 
as of june   we had no remaining deferred stock compensation 
results of operations fiscal years ended june   and revenue years ended june  increase decrease to to in thousands collaboration revenue license and milestone revenue total revenue fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue for fiscal grew from with improvements in both collaboration revenue  which increased million  and license and milestone revenue  which increased million 
the improvement in collaboration revenue was the result of increased revenue  totaling million  from new or expanded collaborations with genentech  astrazeneca  intermune  takeda pharmaceutical company  elan pharmaceuticals  inc  and roche palo alto llc 
this increase was partially offset by expired research programs with icos corporation  japan tobacco inc  and genpath pharmaceuticals  which had resulted in a total of million in revenue during fiscal further offsetting the increase in collaboration revenue were the declines in revenue from custom libraries of million and lead generation libraries of million  each declining primarily due to continued increasing competition from foreign chemistry service providers 
the up front license fee and phase i milestone payment for arry that we received from astrazeneca in the latter half of fiscal  together with the up front license fee that we received from genentech in the same half of the fiscal  aggregating million  caused the majority of the increase to license and milestone revenue 
revenues associated with these arrangements were recognized over the full year of fiscal  compared to recognition during only part of the year in fiscal a million milestone payment received from amgen in fiscal also contributed to the increased license and milestone revenue 
fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue for fiscal and remained relatively flat 
increased revenue from up front license fees and milestone payments largely offset the decline in collaboration revenue 
partial recognition of up front license fees from astrazeneca and genentech and a phase i milestone payment for arry from astrazeneca  totaling million in the aggregate  represented the majority of the increase to license and milestone revenue 
decreased collaboration revenue from expired programs with icos  amgen  merck and co  inc  and vertex pharmaceuticals incorporated of million in total was partially offset by revenue from new collaborations with genentech  astrazeneca and genpath of million in total 
in addition  collaboration revenue from our lead generation libraries and optimer building blocks declined million in fiscal compared to  primarily due to increased competition from foreign chemistry service providers 
cost of revenue years ended june  increase decrease to to in thousands cost of revenue provision for excess inventory total cost of revenue fiscal as compared to fiscal the increased cost of revenue for fiscal of over is largely the result of supporting the increase in collaboration revenue 
improvements in cost of revenue as a percentage of collaboration revenue of in fiscal compared to in fiscal is the result of slightly improved average pricing from collaborations and the reduction in the custom library business 
cost of revenue includes million for accrued bonuses  which was offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of million 
fiscal as compared to fiscal the increased cost of revenue for fiscal was primarily related to increased costs associated with staffing various collaborations  including increased scientific salaries and benefits and to a lesser extent  increased utility charges 
we also experienced slightly lower average pricing received from collaborations than in the prior year 
also during  we had a lower percentage of our total revenue generated from licensing of chemical compounds from lead generation libraries and sales of optimer building blocks 
due to the evolution of our business model to focus primarily on our proprietary drug discovery efforts  we do not expect that lead generation libraries will be a significant source of revenues in future periods  and no new lead generation libraries will be produced other than for our own proprietary research 
consequently  we reviewed the inventory levels and carrying values for lead generation libraries  optimer building blocks and fine chemicals during the third quarter of fiscal based on this review and on an analysis of expected future sales and industry standards relating to net carrying values  we determined that there was an excess level of lead generation library and optimer building block inventory 
we also determined that our inventory of fine chemicals used as the starting materials for lead generation libraries exceeded anticipated usage 
accordingly  we increased the reserves for these inventories  which resulted in a non cash charge for excess inventory of million in the third quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we increased our inventory reserves for lead generation libraries by million 
the reserves were increased in light of difficult market conditions and resulting declines in lead generation library revenue experienced during the second half of fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery our research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery include costs associated with our proprietary drug programs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  sponsored research  allocated facility costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical trials  and stock based compensation 
we manage our proprietary programs based on scientific data and achievement of research plan goals 
our scientists record their time to specific projects when possible 
however  many activities simultaneously benefit multiple projects and cannot be readily attributed to a specific project 
accordingly  the accurate assignment of time and costs to a specific project is difficult and may not give a true indication of the actual costs of a particular project 
as a result  we do not report costs on a program basis 
the following table shows our research and development expenses by categories of costs for the periods presented years ended june  increase to to in thousands salaries and benefits consulting and outsourced services laboratory supplies facilities and depreciation other research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery increased over the prior fiscal year relating to accrued bonuses  increased laboratory supplies  facilities costs and depreciation related to our expanded facilities  and increased pharmacology studies supporting our expanded efforts to advance proprietary compounds into regulated safety testing 
the most significant increase in costs came from outsourced pharmacology studies to support the advancement of our erb egfr  p  mek for inflammation  and other programs 
as a result  total consulting and outsourced services costs  including pharmacology studies  increased to million in  from million in we expect that proprietary research and development spending will continue to increase as we focus more resources on our proprietary drug discovery programs and advance our programs potentially through clinical development 
for fiscal year  we expensed approximately  related to accrued cash bonuses that were paid subsequent to june fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery increased related to our expanded efforts to advance compounds into regulated safety testing 
in addition  a number of new programs were initiated during the year  and the lead compound in our mek for cancer program advanced through regulated safety assessment 
supporting these efforts were additional scientists and increased outsourced and internally generated pharmacology studies 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products  as well as our limited capital resources 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animals and phase i  ii and iii clinical studies in humans each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
therefore  we expect our research and development costs to increase as we progress our programs through development 
the successful development and commercialization of drugs resulting from our proprietary programs is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks that are beyond our control 
the duration and cost of discovery  preclinical  nonclinical and clinical trials may vary significantly based on the type  complexity and novelty of a product and are difficult to predict 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from preclinical  nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity or be susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our drug candidates will generate revenue and net cash inflows 
status of significant proprietary programs the following table summarizes the status of our most advanced drug candidates 
drug target indication development status mek cancer arry azd beginning phase ib clinical trials erbb egfr cancer beginning phase i clinical trials in the fall of mek inflammation regulated safety assessment p inflammation pre clinical development erbb cancer pre clinical development clinical timelines  likelihood of success and total completion costs vary significantly for each drug candidate and are difficult to estimate 
we estimate that it takes to years or possibly longer  to discover  develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states as outlined in the following table phase objective estimated duration discovery lead identification and target validation to years preclinical initial toxicology for preliminary identification of risks for humans  gather early pharmacokinetic data to years phase i evaluate safety in humans  study how the drug works  metabolizes and interacts with other drugs to years phase ii establish effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage  continue safety evaluation to years phase iii confirm efficacy  dosage regime and safety profile of the drug  submit new drug application to years fda approval approval by the fda to sell and market the drug under approved labeling months to years animal and other nonclinical studies typically are conducted during each phase of human clinical studies 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals  and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses years ended june  increase decrease to to in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily related to increased patents and patent application costs related to our expanding proprietary drug development programs of approximately  and  to a lesser degree  increased compliance costs of approximately  related to section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the remaining increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefit related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include approximately  for accrued bonuses  which was partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of approximately  we expect patent related costs to continue to increase in the near term and the sarbanes oxley act compliance costs to decrease due to first year implementation expenses that are not expected to recur 
fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was attributable to a march workforce reduction whereby we reduced our workforce by employees in order to reduce costs and match our headcount resources with the near term demand for our collaboration programs 
this reduction resulted in a fiscal charge to selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately  for termination related costs consisting primarily of severance payments and out placement services for affected employees 
the remaining year over year decrease was attributable to cost savings associated with the elimination of certain administrative positions that were affected by this reduction in workforce 
compensation related to option grants years ended june  increase decrease to to in thousands compensation related to option grants fiscal as compared to fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded approximately  of stock compensation expense  representing the final amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the vesting of stock options that were granted prior to our initial public offering of common stock in november fiscal as compared to fiscal compensation expense relates to certain stock options that were granted prior to the november initial public offering 
this non cash charge was recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the related options  which was generally four years 
net interest income years ended june  increase decrease to to in thousands net interest income fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to higher investment interest rates earned on a higher average marketable securities balance 
our marketable securities balance increased significantly during the year due to the follow on public offering completed in december fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to lower investment interest rates earned on a lower average marketable securities balance 
other other expense loss on investment 
in march  we entered into a drug discovery collaboration agreement with aptus genomics  inc to create small molecule therapeutics against select g protein coupled receptor gpcr targets 
array worked exclusively with aptus on a select number of gpcr targets and provided aptus access to its lead generation libraries in exchange for  of common stock in aptus 
during fiscal  the value of aptus common stock decreased significantly 
we determined this reduction in value to be other than temporary and as a result  wrote off our investment 
income taxes 
there was no income tax expense for the fiscal years ended june   or at june   we had federal and colorado income tax net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of million  which will expire beginning in and continuing through we have provided a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets  as based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
liquidity and capital resources as of june  in thousands cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities increase decrease in net operating assets and liabilities  excluding cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities purchases of property  plant and equipment cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities fiscal as compared to fiscal we have historically funded our operations through cash received from our collaborations and the issuance of equity securities 
as of june   cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities totaled million compared with million at june  this increase was primarily attributable to the net proceeds received from our common stock offering in december  resulting in net proceeds of million 
net cash used in operating activities for fiscal year was million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal during fiscal year  our net loss of million was reduced by noncash charges of million  primarily associated with depreciation and deferred rent expense 
for the fiscal year  our net operating assets and liabilities  excluding cash and marketable securities  increased by million 
this was due to decreases in advance payment balances of million from collaborators  which was partially offset by decreased inventory balances of million and increased accrued compensation  accounts payable and other liabilities totaling million 
the combined balance of advance payments from collaborators decreased by million during fiscal year due to the recognition of revenue from previously received up front license and milestone payments 
the decrease in inventory balances resulted from a significant sale of lead generation library chemical compounds that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal accrued compensation and benefits increased primarily from reserving for a planned cash employee bonus program for the year 
during fiscal year  we invested million in laboratory equipment  primarily for our process research  biology and cgmp manufacturing operations  as well as in various computer hardware and software 
purchases of marketable securities used million of cash while proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities provided million of cash 
approximately  of cash became restricted during the year in support of outstanding standby letters of credit related to our facilities leases that increased in a like amount 
financing activities provided million of cash consisting of million in net proceeds from our public common stock offering  million for proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt and million of cash resulting from the exercise of stock options under our stock option plan and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
fiscal as compared to fiscal as of june   cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities totaled million compared to million at june  net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year  compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for fiscal during fiscal year  our net loss of million was reduced by noncash charges of million associated with depreciation  compensation related to stock option grants  deferred rent and a provision for excess inventory 
for the fiscal year  our net operating assets and liabilities  excluding cash and marketable securities  decreased by million primarily due to a million increase in advance payments from collaborators and a million decrease in inventories 
advance payments from collaborators primarily increased due to the receipt of up front license and milestone payments totaling million for fiscal we recognized million of these up front license and milestone payments as revenue during  and recorded the remaining amounts as advance payments from collaborators 
inventories decreased by million due to the increased inventory reserves for lead generation libraries  optimer building blocks and certain fine chemicals used as the starting materials for lead generation libraries 
during fiscal year  we invested million in capital equipment and leasehold improvements primarily associated with equipping and commencing operations in our new pharmacology and drug metabolism facilities 
financing activities provided million of cash resulting from the exercise of stock options under our stock option plan and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the rate at which we invest in proprietary research  the growth of our collaboration business and the amount of collaboration research funding we receive  the timing of milestone and royalty payments  if any  from our collaboration and out licensed programs  our capital spending on new facilities and equipment  expenses associated with unforeseen litigation  regulatory changes  competition  technological developments  general economic conditions and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses  products and technologies 
in addition  our future capital requirements may be impacted if we do not receive potential milestone or royalty payments under our existing or future collaboration agreements 
our ability to realize these payments is subject to a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control and include the following the drug development process is risky and highly uncertain  and we or our collaborators may not be successful in commercializing drug candidates we create  our collaborators have substantial control and discretion over the timing and continued development and marketing of drug candidates we create  the sale and manufacture of drug candidates we develop may not obtain regulatory approval  and  if regulatory approval is received  drugs we develop will remain subject to regulation or may not gain market acceptance  which could delay or prevent us from generating milestone or royalty revenue from the commercialization of these drugs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and anticipated cash flow from existing collaboration agreements will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next months 
this estimate of our future capital requirements is a forward looking statement that is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual future capital requirements could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the progress of our research activities  the availability of resources for revenue generating collaborations as we devote more resources to our proprietary programs  our ability to enter into agreements to out license and co develop our proprietary drug candidates  and the timing of those agreements in each candidate s development stage  the number and scope of our research programs  the progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the progress of the development efforts of our collaborators  our ability to establish and maintain current and new collaboration agreements  the ability of our collaborators to fund research and development programs  the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the decision to stay in our current facilities  or to consolidate operations in an existing or new location  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and the costs of establishing clinical development  business development and distribution or commercialization capabilities 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  which we do not expect to achieve in the foreseeable future  we expect to continue to utilize our existing cash and marketable securities resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of our equity offerings 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining new or in retaining existing out license or collaboration agreements  in securing agreements for the co development of our proprietary drug candidates  or in receiving milestone and or royalty payments under those agreements  that our existing cash and marketable securities resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  this financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose  or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
obligations and commitments the following table shows our contractual obligations and commitments as of june  payments due by period in thousands less than year years years after years total operating lease obligations purchase obligations debt obligations total obligations we are obligated under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities and certain equipment 
original lease terms for our facilities range from five to eight years with renewal options and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area and other operating costs 
equipment leases generally range from three to five years 
due to the high cost to replace and the limited availability of laboratory facilities  we concluded that the exercise of a portion of our lease term options for at least years was reasonably assured 
during the last quarter of fiscal  we reassessed our facility requirements  and began to consider the possibility of consolidating operations in one of our existing locations  or a new location 
while we have not yet made a final determination whether to consolidate operations at one location  it is no longer reasonably assured that we will remain in our boulder  colorado location beyond the initial lease term  which ends in march we have not changed our determination that it is reasonably assured that we will exercise certain of our lease extensions and lease our other facility  located in longmont  colorado  for at least another years 
therefore  we have included in our operating lease obligations reflected in the table above the cash to be paid for our facility leases for the remaining reasonably assured lease terms of three years for our boulder facility and years for our longmont facility 
the portion of operating lease obligations that is related to optional extension periods for our longmont facility is million and is included within the after years column above 
at june   we had restricted cash of million as a compensating balance to support outstanding standby letters of credit that were issued during the prior fiscal years in relation to our facilities leases 
critical accounting policies we believe critical accounting policies are essential to the understanding of our results of operations and require our management to make significant judgments in preparing the financial statements included in this report 
management has made estimates and assumptions based on these policies 
we do not believe that materially different amounts would be reported if different assumptions were used 
however  the application of these policies involves judgments and assumptions as to future events and  as a result  actual results could differ 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition we believe our revenue recognition policy is significant because the amount and timing of revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow the guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
 which requires that a series of criteria be met in order to recognize revenue related to the performance of services or the shipment of products 
if these criteria are not met  the associated revenue is deferred until the criteria are met 
we recognize revenue when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b products are delivered or services are rendered  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collectibility is assured 
most of our revenue is derived from designing  creating  optimizing and evaluating drug candidates for our collaborators 
the majority of our collaboration revenue consists of fees received based on contracted annual rates for full time equivalent employees working on a project 
our collaboration agreements also include license and up front fees  milestone payments upon achievement of specified research or development goals and royalties on sales of resulting products 
a small portion of our revenue comes from development and fixed fee revenue and from sales of compounds on a per compound basis 
our collaboration agreements typically call for a specific level of resources as measured by the number of full time equivalent employees working a defined number of hours per year at a stated price under the agreement 
we recognize revenue under our collaboration agreements on a monthly basis for fees paid to us based on hours worked 
we recognize revenue from sales of lead generation library and optimer building block compounds as the compounds are shipped  as these agreements are priced on a per compound basis and title and risk of loss passes upon shipment to our customers 
revenue from license fees and up front fees is non refundable and is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected period of the related research program 
milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue over the expected period of the related research program 
a portion of any milestone payment is recognized at the date the milestone is achieved which is determined using the applicable percentage of the research term that has elapsed at the date the milestone is achieved 
any balance is recognized ratably over the remaining research term 
revenue recognition related to license fees  up front payments and milestone payments could be accelerated in the event of early termination of programs 
in general  contract provisions include predetermined payment schedules or the submission of appropriate billing detail 
payments received in advance of performance are recorded as advance payments from collaborators until the revenue is earned 
we report revenue for lead generation and lead optimization research  custom synthesis and process research  the development and sale of chemical compounds and the co development of proprietary drug candidates we out license  as collaboration revenue 
license and milestone revenue is combined and reported separately from collaboration revenue
