item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations we currently derive the majority of our revenues from sales of products and services to utilities 
sales revenues may include hardware  software licenses  custom software development  field and project management services and engineering  consulting and installation services 
service revenues include post sale maintenance support and outsourcing services 
outsourcing services encompass installation  operation and maintenance of meter reading systems to provide meter information to a customer for billing and management purposes for systems we own as well as those owned by our customers 
hardware cost of sales are based on standard costs  which include materials  direct labor  warranty expense and an overhead allocation  as well as variances from standard costs 
software cost of sales include distribution and documentation costs for applications sold  along with other labor and operating costs for custom software development  project management  consulting and systems support 
hardware and software cost of services are based on actual time and materials incurred and an allocation of miscellaneous service related costs 
executive highlights on july   we completed the acquisition of sem  which is now our hardware solutions electricity metering segment 
as a result of the acquisition  we are now the largest supplier of electricity meters in the us the purchase price was approximately million  which we financed with the issuance of debt 
for the six month period ended december   the acquisition resulted in a significant increase in our revenues and changed many other aspects of our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows  which are described in detail in each applicable area within the discussion that follows 
total revenues in were million compared with million in hardware solutions electricity metering contributed million of the million in total revenues in since the acquisition of our electricity metering business  a higher portion of our electric amr shipments have been in the form of solid state electricity meters with amr embedded which are included in electricity metering revenues as opposed to separate modules for installation on new or existing mechanical electric meters which are included in meter data collection revenues 
prior to the acquisition of our electricity metering business  revenues from shipments of new meters with amr embedded were in the form of royalties only 
this represents a fundamental change in the way we distribute our products and is an important transition to understand when comparing segment performance from period to period 
our meter data collection and software solutions businesses are primarily project based sales  and as a result  our historical financial results have varied from period to period  primarily as a result of the timing of large orders 
we believe this variability will be partially offset by our new electricity metering business  which predominately consists of shorter term purchase orders against long term arrangements 
total new order bookings in were million 
of that  million was from electricity metering and includes electricity meters sold with amr 
by comparison  new order bookings were million in our book to bill ratio for was approximately to  compared with approximately to in  indicating increasing demand compared to shipments 
total company backlog was million at december   compared with million at december   with the increase attributable to electricity metering 
during  we implemented a new organizational structure  reconfigured around two primary operations groups  hardware solutions and software solutions 
in addition  throughout  we made other adjustments  
table of contents including staffing reductions to provide for increased alignment between our current operating performance and our long term business strategy 
revenues and gross margins total revenues and gross margins the following tables summarize our revenues and gross margin for each of the years ended december   and year ended december  change change in millions revenues sales service total revenues year ended december  gross margin sales service total gross margin revenues we had a million increase in sales revenues for the increase resulted from million in electricity metering sales revenue offset by decreases in meter data collection and software solutions sales revenues of million and million  respectively 
service revenues also increased in  compared with  due to the addition of million in electricity metering services revenues  as well as an increase in software solutions maintenance fees and services 
approximately half of the growth in revenues from to was driven by two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and one acquisition in the first quarter of the remaining revenue growth in over was driven by higher amr hardware revenues and royalty income  offset by lower revenues from installations related to meter reading systems 
no customer represented more than of total revenues in or one group of affiliated customers  national grid usa  accounted for approximately of total revenues in the top ten customers for accounted for approximately of revenues compared with approximately and of revenues in and  respectively 
gross margins as a percentage of revenue  sales gross margin for decreased two percentage points  compared with  primarily due to lower margins in our meter data collection business and the addition of our electricity metering business on july   which had slightly lower gross margin than the rest of our business 
service gross margins decreased in  as a result of the addition of our electricity metering business  offset by increased service margins in meter data collections 
sales gross margin for decreased two percentage points  compared with  primarily due to an increase in warranty expense in for a specific hardware product failure 
service gross margin increased six 
table of contents percentage points in  compared with  primarily due to a one time increase in costs associated with a long term service contract in for a more detailed discussion  see the segment revenues  gross margin and operating income loss section 
segment revenues  gross margin and operating income loss in  we implemented an organizational change that resulted in a change in our segment reporting from five market facing business units electric  natural gas  water public power  international and end user solutions to two operating groups hardware solutions and software solutions 
our hardware solutions operating group is further defined between meter data collection and electricity metering 
the segment information in this annual report on form k is based on our current segment reporting structure and historical segment information has been restated 
management has three primary measures for each of the operating groups revenue  gross profit margin and operating income loss 
revenues for each operating group are reported according to product lines 
there are no inter operating group revenues 
within hardware solutions  costs of sales are based on standard costs  which include materials  direct labor  warranty expense and an overhead allocation  as well as variances from standard costs 
software cost of sales include distribution and documentation costs for applications sold  along with other labor and operating costs for custom software development  project management  consulting and systems support 
hardware and software cost of services are based on actual time and materials incurred and an allocation of miscellaneous service related costs 
operating expenses directly associated with each operating group may include sales  marketing  product development or administrative expenses 
corporate operating expenses  interest revenue  interest expense  equity in the income loss of investees accounted for by the equity method  amortization expense and income tax expense benefit are not allocated to the operating groups  nor included in the measure of segment profit or loss 
assets and liabilities are not allocated to the operating groups  except for the new hardware solutions electricity metering operating group  which is individually maintained and reviewed 
approximately of depreciation expense is allocated to the operating groups 
we classify sales in the us and canada as domestic revenues

table of contents the following tables and discussion highlight significant changes in trends or components of revenues and gross margin for each segment 
year ended december  change change in millions segment revenues hardware solutions meter data collection electricity metering total hardware solutions software solutions total company year ended december  segment gross margin hardware solutions meter data collection electricity metering total hardware solutions software solutions total company year ended december  change change in millions segment operating income loss hardware solutions meter data collection electricity metering other unallocated costs total hardware solutions software solutions corporate unallocated total company hardware solutions meter data collection meter data collection revenues decreased million  or  for  compared with  primarily as a result of lower standalone amr module shipments for electric and gas meters and fewer handheld meter reading system upgrades 
we shipped approximately million standalone electric  gas and water amr modules in  compared with million shipped in however  in the six month period ended december   we also shipped just under  electricity meters with our amr technology embedded that are reflected in electricity metering revenues 
prior to our acquisition of sem on july   revenues from these shipments were in the form of royalties only and were reflected in meter data collection revenues 
also contributing to lower meter data collection revenues in was slow order activity in late and the first nine months of from large investor owned utilities resulting from financial constraints at utilities and a general reluctance on their part to spend capital 
despite the lower revenues in  market interest and request for proposal rfp activity remained strong and in the last quarter of  we had our highest quarter of new order bookings in this segment since the third quarter of 
table of contents meter data collection revenues in increased million  or  compared with  primarily as a result of increased amr system sales 
however  amr revenues grew more slowly in compared with the previous two years as several large amr orders were completed and not replaced by new bookings of similar size orders 
in particular  in several large investor owned electric utilities and electric and gas combination utilities delayed orders due to several instances of extreme weather  a major blackout in the northeastern us and other utility specific delays in capital spending 
we shipped approximately million standalone amr modules in compared with approximately million in sales of handheld computer systems were slightly higher in  while maintenance services were lower due to initial warranty periods for new handheld system sales 
there were no customers that represented more than of meter data collection revenues in and one group of affiliated customers  national grid usa  represented approximately of meter data collection revenues and approximately of total company revenues in meter data collection gross margins declined three percentage points in compared with due to fewer handheld unit sales and lower margins on those sales  a shift in the mix of hardware products  including the mix of amr modules  lower average selling prices on electric amr modules and the decrease in royalty revenues 
also contributing to lower margins in were increased sales through indirect channels 
revenues through indirect sales channels  which include sales through meter manufacturers  business associates and other alliance partners  were of total meter data collection revenues in  compared with in offsetting these gross margin decreases were better margins on installation contracts and reduced warranty expense in in  approximately million was expensed for a specific electric amr module replacement compared with million for this situation in meter data collection gross margins in were comparable with favorable changes in the mix of amr modules  a higher amount of handheld unit sales and an increase in royalty revenues of approximately million  primarily from sem  contributed to higher gross margin in offsetting these gross margin increases was warranty expense related to specific electric amr module replacements 
in addition  higher than normal installation costs on an amr contract with one customer affected gross margin 
in the fourth quarter of  we had million in costs for this contract that were in excess of revenues  approximately million of which was a forward loss accrual for completion of the project in also affecting gross margin was a decrease in the average selling prices of electric meter modules for certain large orders 
meter data collection operating expenses decreased million in  compared with  primarily due to spending reductions in marketing and product development  offset slightly by increases in sales expense 
operating expenses increased  in  compared with  primarily due to product development increases 
however  as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses remained constant at for  and hardware solutions electricity metering we acquired our electricity metering business as of july  sales of meters and related services resulted in million of revenues for the six months ended december  we shipped approximately million meters in the six months ended december   of which approximately were enabled with our amr technology and another were enabled with other amr vendors technology 
in addition to meter sales  we had million of revenues during the six months ended december  from manufacturing support services to a former affiliate of schlumberger  which services we phased out by december  the former affiliate of schlumberger represented million  or  of segment revenues for the six months ended december   of which million are the services we phased out by december  electricity metering gross margin for the six months ended december  was 
margins on meter sales and related services were approximately during the six months ended december   while margins on the former affiliate manufacturing support services were approximately 
electricity metering gross margins 
table of contents would have been approximately two percentage points higher in  however  purchase accounting rules under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap required that we value the finished goods inventory at the date of acquisition at the expected sales price less cost to complete and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort 
operating expenses for electricity metering were million for the six months ended december   of which million represented ipr d  which was expensed in accordance with gaap 
we anticipate operating expenses for electricity metering will be lower as a percentage of revenue  compared with meter data collection  due to lower product development and marketing expenses as a result of a more narrowly focused product offering 
hardware solutions other unallocated costs general and administrative expenses not directly associated with either the meter data collection or electricity metering operations are classified as hardware solutions other unallocated costs 
these operating expenses increased approximately  for  compared with  primarily due to the increased operating expenses with the addition of electricity metering 
software solutions the decrease of million  or  in software solutions revenues in  compared with  resulted from lower software license fees for transmission and distribution design tools and reduced handheld software upgrades  offset by increases in commercial and industrial meter data collection software license upgrade sales and maintenance revenues 
revenues in increased million  or  compared with as a result of one acquisition in the fourth quarter of and one acquisition in the first quarter of there were no customers that represented more than of software solutions revenues in and one customer in represented of total software solutions revenues 
gross margins increased in  compared with  primarily as a result of increased productivity levels due to lower software implementation costs as a result of workforce reductions in  along with higher maintenance revenue due to a larger software install base 
gross margins in were comparable with  due to increases in software maintenance revenue  offset by decreased internal workforce utilization rates 
software licenses were approximately of total software revenue in  compared with and in and  respectively 
gross margin dollars for software solutions are not yet sufficient to cover current operating expenses  which include a significant investment in product development 
however  workforce and facility reductions during and have contributed to lower operating losses in software solutions operating expenses decreased million in  compared with and decreased as a percentage of revenue from to 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in corporate unallocated operating expenses not directly associated with an operating group are classified as corporate unallocated 
these expenses increased million in  compared with  primarily due to an million increase in intangible asset amortization expenses  most of which was attributable to the sem acquisition  a million increase in restructuring charges and other increased operating expenses associated with the sem acquisition  as well as an increase in outside professional services 
expenses increased in  compared with  primarily due to costs associated with the two acquisitions in and the acquisition in early partially offsetting the increases in was million in expense in for the settlement of a patent infringement litigation 

table of contents operating expenses we have made reclassifications between historical sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses in order to conform to the current organizational structure and current period presentation 
the following table details our total operating expenses in dollars and as a percent of revenues 
year ended december  of revenue of revenue of revenue in millions in millions in millions operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructurings in process research and development litigation accrual total operating expenses operating expenses increased each of the past three years primarily due to one acquisition in  one acquisition in and three acquisitions in sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in and million  or  in as a result of additional sales and marketing staff and product marketing activities primarily related to new products and services from acquisitions  partially offset by staffing reductions throughout as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing decreased two percentage points in due to a more narrowly focused product offering for electricity metering  compared with meter data collection and software solutions 
there was no bonus and profit sharing expense in sales and marketing in or  compared with million in product development expenses increased million  or  in and million  or  in due primarily to increased staffing and other development expenses related to acquisitions 
the increase in was partially offset by reductions in materials spending and staff reductions related to the discontinuance of development and sales of transmission and substation design tools 
there was no bonus and profit sharing expense in product development in or  compared with million in as a percentage of revenues  product development decreased two percentage points from to  due to electricity metering s more narrowly focused product offering 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in and million  or  in  primarily due to the acquisition of electricity metering  as well as increases in professional services for sarbanes oxley compliance  planning for the sem integration  increased audit and tax fees  the write off of internal software no longer in use and an increase in headcount for general and administrative functions 
approximately half of the expense increases in and resulted from acquisitions with additional increases related to consulting costs for sarbanes oxley compliance and legal costs associated with a patent litigation 
we accrued approximately  in discretionary incentive compensation in  compared with no bonus and profit sharing expense in and million in amortization of intangibles increased as a result of the addition of million  million and million in amortizable intangible assets from acquisitions completed in  and  respectively 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests in the fourth quarters of  and  and concluded in all cases that goodwill was not impaired 

table of contents restructuring expenses were million in we implemented a new internal organizational structure and assessed market conditions for certain parts of our business  which resulted in several actions to reduce spending and eliminate certain unprofitable activities 
we believe these restructurings will provide increased alignment between our current operating performance and our long term business strategy 
in total  in  we reduced our staffing by approximately employees 
in  we initiated a restructuring of our energy information systems group located in raleigh  north carolina  which included a workforce reduction of approximately employees and recognized a charge of approximately million related to severance during in  we expensed million for planned costs related to the restructuring of our european operations 
the restructuring plan resulted in the closure of the vienne  france office  a reduction in workforce  the consolidation of product development efforts into existing company locations and the outsourcing of select production efforts in order to improve the overall profitability of our foreign operations 
continuation of this activity in resulted in an additional  of restructuring charges in from the write down of fixed assets and lease termination charges 
in process research and development expenses as part of our acquisitions in  and  we recorded charges for ipr d as follows year of acquisition ipr d estimated cost to complete technology discount rate applied to ipr d weighted average cost of capital in millions schlumberger s electricity metering business silicon energy corp 
linesoft corporation our july  our acquisition of sem resulted in million of ipr d expense  consisting primarily of next generation polyphase meter technology  valued at million 
the ipr d projects were analyzed according to exclusivity  substance  economic benefit  incompleteness  measurability and alternative future use 
the primary projects are intended to make key enhancements and improve functionality of our polyphase meter 
we have estimated the research and development to be approximately complete  with a cost to complete the development of approximately million over the next twelve months 
we used the income approach  which uses the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated  to value the ipr d 
the risk adjusted discount rate was percent  which was based on several factors such as the industry composite of weighted average cost of capital  weighted average return on assets  internal rate of return and perceived risk of the projects 
we have a high degree of confidence that we will be able to complete the development of these in process development projects as we believe we have no major technological hurdles and no significant resource constraints 
in addition  the development of these projects is not dependent on a single individual 
however  if the projects are not completed on a timely basis  we may face increasing competition from competitors that are able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
at december   we believe we are progressing with the development of these projects as estimated  with no significant changes 
at march   silicon was in the process of developing new software products that had not yet reached technological feasibility 
the fair value of the ipr d was estimated using the income approach 
the discount rate applicable to the cash flows of the products reflects the stage of completion and other risks inherent in the projects 
the discount rate used in the valuation of silicon s ipr d was percent 
the fair value of ipr d was estimated to be  with an estimated cost to complete of approximately million 
the in process technology was substantially complete in 
table of contents our acquisition of linesoft in resulted in a fair value of million attributed to ipr d  determined using the income approach 
each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility and the stage of completion 
future cash flows were estimated taking into account the expected life cycles of the product and the underlying technology  relevant market sizes and industry trends 
a discount rate was determined based on an assessment of the weighted average cost of capital of linesoft  a weighted average return on assets  the internal rate of return of the investment in the acquisition of linesoft and venture capital rates of return 
the discount rate used in the valuation of linesoft s ipr d was percent 
the linesoft purchased in process technology was completed in the current year 
other income expense the following table shows the components of other income expense 
year ended december  in thousands equity in affiliates interest income interest expense other income expense  net total other income expense included in equity in affiliates is income of  and  in and  respectively  related to our equity interest in servatron  inc servatron  a company that performs contract manufacturing and repair services for us 
servatron had minimal net income for interest income in was primarily the result of interest earned on our million in senior subordinated notes while they were held in escrow from their issuance on may  until their use to purchase sem on july  we maintained minimal operating cash in due to optional prepayments on debt  and therefore  minimal interest income from operating cash balances 
the majority of interest income in and consisted of interest earned from operating cash balances 
our average operating cash balances were million and in and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense during  compared with  is primarily due to interest and the amortization of prepaid debt fees related to the debt we issued in may and july to fund the acquisition of sem 
this debt consisted of million in senior subordinated notes that bear interest at and our senior secured credit facility term loan of million  which bears interest based on the london interbank offering rate libor plus to or the wells fargo bank  national association s prime rate prime plus to  based on our consolidated leverage ratio at december  
cash interest obligations for were approximately million  compared with million in the remaining amount of interest expense in each period is related to amortization of debt fees and discount 
interest expense in resulted primarily from interest expense and amortization of prepaid debt fees on the term loan and credit line entered into in march for the silicon acquisition 
interest expense in resulted primarily from subordinated debt  which we converted to equity in april and may the weighted average of outstanding borrowings was million in  compared with million in and million in other expense of  in consisted primarily of a  impairment charge in the second quarter of to the remaining loan balance and accrued interest on the home ecosystems  inc  dba lanthorn 
table of contents technologies  inc lanthorn loans  as lanthorn substantially ceased operations in may  partially offset by foreign currency gains 
other expense of million in was primarily due to a million impairment charge related to lanthorn due to the estimated fair market value of the company as indicated by lanthorn s last round of financing  and a  write off of our minority ownership interest in another entity 
the expenses were partially offset by foreign currency gains and certain tax credits 
included in other income was an  pretax gain from the sale of our raleigh  nc facility and a  pretax gain from the early payoff of the mortgage on our spokane facility 
income taxes our effective income tax rate can vary from period to period due to fluctuations in operating results  changes in valuation allowances for deferred tax assets which adjust tax assets to an amount that will likely be realized  new or revised tax legislation and changes in the level of business performed in domestic and international jurisdictions 
our effective income tax rate can differ from the federal statutory rate of due to ipr d charges  state income taxes  extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefits  research credits and changes in valuation allowances 
our annual effective income tax rate was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in  our effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate because the net tax benefit recorded in the financial statements was increased by the benefit of approximately  in research credits 
the and rates exceeded the statutory rate because the  and million ipr d expenses in the respective years were not tax deductible 
the tax treatment of ipr d expenses depends on the type of acquisition 
the acquisition of sem was treated as an asset purchase for tax purposes  accordingly  the ipr d expense will be deducted for tax purposes over years 
the company acquired the stock of silicon and linesoft so the ipr d expenses were not tax deductible 
the ipr d charges for fiscal year did not affect the effective rate as they will be deductible for tax in future years 
financial condition cash flow information year ended december  in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the largest component of non cash items in was depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately million 
by comparison  depreciation and amortization was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
another major component of non cash items in  and was ipr d charges of million   and million  respectively 
stock option income tax benefits provided non cash inflows of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
partially off setting the non cash inflows during  was an increase in deferred income tax assets of approximately million 
by comparison  in and  there were decreases in deferred income tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in deferred income tax assets during was due to differences in tax versus book intangible assets amortization rates for the electricity metering acquisition and due to the million ipr d charge  which was fully expensed in for book purposes  compared with a year tax amortization rate 
the decrease in and was attributable to the utilization of net operating losses 
there were no other significant changes for the components of non cash items between  and 
table of contents changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions  provided million in cash during the year ended december  high cash collections on accounts receivable and an increase in unearned revenue were partially offset by cash used to build inventories and cash used to perform warranty related activities 
the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from strong cash collections of accounts receivable throughout unearned revenue increased during due to increases in fees for certain software support services 
accounts payable  accrued expenses and short term warranty accruals decreased primarily due to the use of million in cash related to warranty activities for a specific electric amr module product failure that was accrued for at year end changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions  during the year ended december  resulted in a use of cash of million 
the use of cash resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivable  a payment to settle patent infringement litigation  payment of bonus and profit sharing and an amendment to a long term warranty and maintenance agreement 
the accounts receivable balance was high at december  due to the timing of shipments late in the fourth quarter of we made a million cash payment to settle a patent infringement litigation in  million of which was accrued in in addition  we made million in bonus and profit sharing payments during  with no off setting accrual in last  we made a million payment during the year ended december  to duquesne light company in accordance with an amendment to our long term warranty and maintenance agreement  which was charged against the accrued loss for that contract 
changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions  provided million in cash during the year ended december  the increase in resulted primarily from a million patent infringement litigation accrual and bonus and profit sharing accruals in totaling million  net of bonus and profit sharing payments for investing activities we used million for the sem acquisition during the year ended december   compared with million for the silicon acquisition in and million in for sem pre acquisition activities 
during  we used million for three acquisitions 
we used million in cash for property  plant and equipment purchases during  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increase resulted primarily from the expansion of our manufacturing facility in waseca  minnesota  and software purchases for internal use 
we liquidated short term investments in  primarily to fund acquisitions 
net proceeds from short term investments were million in during  proceeds of million on the sale of property  plant and equipment and the reclassification of million from restricted cash for a collateralized letter of credit to cash as a result of a new credit facility also contributed to cash inflows 
financing activities the principal financing activities in included the issuance of approximately million in new debt to finance the sem acquisition partially offset by payments on the new and previously existing debt of approximately million

at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
cash equivalents and short term investments historically have been invested in investments rated a or better by standard poor s or moody s and have market interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on cash equivalents and short term investments 
in connection with our acquisition of sem on july   we replaced our existing credit facility with million of new debt facilities for a net increase in our debt facilities of approximately million 
on july   we closed a million senior secured credit facility comprised of a million five year senior secured revolving credit facility and a million seven year senior secured term loan 
the senior secured credit facility is guaranteed by all of our operating subsidiaries except for our foreign subsidiaries and an outsourcing project subsidiary  all of which are wholly owned 
the annual interest rates under the new facility will vary depending on market rates and our consolidated leverage ratio 
certain existing unamortized debt issue costs and the new debt issuance costs will be amortized over the life of the credit facility using the effective interest method 
unamortized debt issuance costs were approximately million at december  the senior secured credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain certain consolidated leverage and coverage ratios on a quarterly basis  as well as customary covenants that place restrictions on the incurrence of debt  the payment of dividends  certain investments and mergers 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december  the million senior secured term loan term loan matures in and requires minimum quarterly principal payments of  for the first six years million annually and  for each of the last four quarters of the term loan totaling million 
optional repayments of the term loan are permitted without penalty or premium 
additional mandatory prepayments  based on of defined excess cash flows  the issuance of capital stock or the sale of assets as defined by the borrowing agreement  would all decrease the minimum payments in the last four quarters

the classification between current and long term debt is based on the mandatory principal payments defined in the borrowing agreement  as well as an additional million of optional prepayments we expect to make during the first six months of in order to remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
as of march   we already made optional prepayments of million 
these prepayments will also satisfy our mandatory quarterly prepayments for in the event we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make the additional million in optional prepayment in the first six months of  we may issue equity  refinance all or a portion of our debt  seek a waiver of covenant compliance or pursue other alternatives 
for the senior secured revolving credit facility revolver  interest rates are based on the libor plus to  or prime plus to based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
we incur an annual commitment fee on the unused portion of the available revolving credit line  which varies from to  based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
we incur annual letter of credit fees based on a a fronting fee of and b a letter of credit fee that varies from to  based on our consolidated leverage ratio for outstanding letters of credit 
borrowings of any available portion of the million revolver can be made at any time through june  at which time the loan must be repaid 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver and million was utilized by outstanding standby letters of credit resulting in million available for additional borrowings 
our senior secured credit facility required us to enter into an interest rate agreement within days after the funding of the loan to substantially fix or limit the interest rate risk on at least of our aggregate principal amount of debt for a period of not less than three years 
on october   we completed a million interest rate swap whereby we will receive variable interest payments based on the three month libor and pay fixed interest payments based on a rate of  over a three year term 
there were no origination fees or other significant up front costs in connection with this financing instrument 
in addition  on october   we purchased a three month libor interest rate cap pertaining to an additional million of floating rate debt 
the interest rate cap commences on october  and matures on september  the origination fee in connection with the interest rate cap was  which was recorded in other current assets and will be revalued to fair value each quarter 
the million interest rate swap increased the percentage of fixed rate debt to at december   which is above the minimum requirement of 
these derivative instruments were initially designated as cash flow hedges with the after tax effect of the mark to market valuation recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss with the offset included in accrued interest 
however  as a result of the optional prepayments of million in the fourth quarter of and additional anticipated optional prepayments on our term loan  we determined these cash flow hedges to be ineffective  resulting in a recognized net gain of  to interest expense  with a corresponding increase in other current assets  for the change in fair value of the interest rate swap and cap 
the interest rate swap and cap had a fair market value of approximately  and  respectively at december  we will continue to keep these interest rate swap and cap agreements in place as their cash flows will continue to serve to hedge a portion of the outstanding variable rate debt even though the swap does not qualify for hedge accounting 
on may   we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes  discounted to a price of to yield  due in  resulting in a balance of million at december  the discount on the notes will be accreted and the debt issuance costs will be amortized over the life of the credit facility 
fixed annual interest payments are required every six months  commencing in november the notes are subordinated to our new million senior secured credit facility and are guaranteed by all of our operating subsidiaries except for our foreign subsidiaries and an 
table of contents outsourcing project subsidiary  all of which are wholly owned 
the notes contain covenants  which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt  the payment of dividends  certain investments and mergers 
some or all of the notes may be redeemed at our option at any time on or after may   at certain specified premium prices 
at any time prior to may   we may  at our option  redeem up to of the notes with the proceeds of certain sales of our common stock 
we maintain bid and performance bonds for certain customers 
bonds in force were million and million at december  and  respectively 
bid bonds guarantee that we will enter into a contract consistent with the terms of the bid 
performance bonds provide a guarantee to the customer for future performance  which usually covers the installation phase of a contract and may on occasion cover the operations and maintenance phase of outsourcing contracts 
we also have standby letters of credit to guarantee our performance under certain contracts 
the outstanding amounts of standby letters of credit were million and million at december  and  respectively 
we guarantee lease payments for certain equipment leased by servatron 
the maximum future lease obligation of the guarantee at december  was approximately  the lease and our guarantee terminate in in the event servatron is unable to pay a monthly lease obligation  we would be required to make the payment 
if we do not make the payment  the equipment would be returned to the lessor 
in the event that the equipment is not in working condition  we would be obligated to pay for the equipment to be returned to working condition 
we generally provide an indemnification related to the infringement of any patent  copyright  trademark or other intellectual property right on software or equipment within our sales contracts  which indemnifies the customer from and pays the resulting costs  damages and attorney s fees awarded against a customer with respect to such a claim provided that a the customer promptly notifies us in writing of the claim and b we have the sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations 
the terms of the indemnification normally do not limit the maximum potential future payments 
we also provide an indemnification for third party claims resulting from damages caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of our employees agents in connection with the performance of certain contracts 
the terms of the indemnification generally do not limit the maximum potential payments 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims of which the outcomes are subject to significant uncertainty 
our policy is to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the liability required  if any  for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and related pronouncements 
a liability is recorded when we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
at december   we determined that no such losses were probable 
however  we identified a few matters for which a loss was reasonably possible but less than probable 
we have estimated the range for total possible losses in these matters to be between  and  however  in accordance with sfas no 
 no liability has been recorded 
our net deferred tax assets consist of accumulated net operating losses  tax credits and internal revenue code section and section and section limited deferred tax assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of silicon  linesoft and regional economic research  inc we expect to utilize tax loss carryforwards and available tax credits to offset taxes otherwise due on regular taxable income in upcoming years 
during  we expect to pay approximately million in cash for federal alternative minimum tax  international taxes and various state tax obligations 
we expect to begin making significant cash payments for federal tax purposes beginning in as net operating loss carryforwards not limited by section will be fully utilized in and our remaining tax credits not limited by section will be fully utilized in and 
table of contents working capital at december  was million compared with a million working capital deficit at december  the change in working capital primarily results from the acquisition of sem and the classification of our term debt on the balance sheet 
at december   we anticipated that we would not be in compliance with all of our loan agreement covenants through  due substantially to a four quarter rolling calculation of a component of our covenant requirements and the large product warranty accruals in late consequently  the million long term portion of our term loan was classified as a current liability at december  on july   we replaced our credit facility with a seven year senior secured term loan and repaid the existing term loan 
we expect to continue to expand our operations and grow our business through a combination of internal new product development  licensing technology from or to others  distribution agreements  partnership arrangements and acquisitions of technology or other companies 
we expect these activities to be funded from existing cash  cash flow from operations  borrowings and the issuance of common stock or other securities 
we believe existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our existing operations and obligations for at least the next year and foreseeable future  but offer no assurances 
our liquidity could be affected by the stability of the energy and water industries  competitive pressures  international risks  intellectual property claims and other factors described under risks relating to our business within item and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk within item a  included in our annual report on form k

during the fourth quarter of  a judgment was entered against us in a belgian commercial court  which found that itron terminated a distribution agreement with the plaintiff in violation of a belgian law relating to distribution agreements 
all other counts in the complaint were dismissed 
the court did not rule on damages but appointed a special examiner to gather further evidence and determine for the court the amount of the damages 
we believe this determination will be made in the second half of we may appeal the matter 
an appeal of the matter will result in a new trial of all of the causes of action in the original complaint as amended

during and  we made warranty accruals for the product replacement of an electric amr module due to higher than normal estimated failures 
the higher estimated failures resulted from a change in an integrated 
table of contents circuit component s encapsulation material from a supplier to our component supplier for certain lots of a specific electric amr module that were manufactured with this defective component 
the warranty accruals reflected estimates for the material  labor and other costs we expected to incur to replace the majority of affected units 
the replacement work began in and will continue through the warranty accrual balance was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively for this particular amr module 
during and  we added million and million to the accrual and charged million and million  respectively  against the warranty accrual for work performed as a result of a specific component failure 
while we believe we have adequately accrued for this issue  our actual costs may differ from our estimates 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the majority of our revenues are recognized when products are shipped to or received by a customer or when services are provided 
we have certain customer arrangements with multiple elements 
for such arrangements  we determine the fair value of each element and then allocate the total arrangement consideration among the separate elements under the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf revenues for each element are then recognized based on the type of element  such as when the products are shipped  services are delivered  percentage of completion when implementation services are essential to the software performance  upon customer acceptance provisions or transfer of title 
under outsourcing arrangements  revenue is recognized as services are provided 
hardware and software post sale maintenance support fees are recognized ratably over the performance period 
revenue can vary significantly from period to period based on the timing of orders and the application of revenue recognition criteria 
use of the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition requires estimating the cost to complete a project 
the estimation of costs through completion of a project is subject to many variables such as the length of time to complete  changes in wages  subcontractor performance  supplier information  and business volume assumptions 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates may adversely or positively affect financial performance 
unearned revenue is recorded for products or services when the criteria for revenue recognition has not been met 
the majority of unearned revenue relates to annual billing terms for post sale maintenance and support agreements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the balance sheet 
the balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivable portfolio 
we estimate the valuation allowance based on our historical experience of bad debts and is adjusted for estimated uncollectible amounts 
a specific receivable is reviewed for impairment when  based on current information and events  we deem it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts that are contractually due to us 
inventories inventories include raw materials  sub assemblies and finished goods 
inventory amounts include the cost to manufacture the item  such as the cost of raw materials  labor and other applied direct and indirect costs 
if the market value of the inventory falls below the original cost  the inventory value is reduced to the market value 
items are removed from inventory using the first in  first out method 
debt issue costs debt issue costs represent direct costs incurred related to the issuance of long term debt  which are recorded in other noncurrent assets as of december  these costs are amortized to interest expense over the lives of the respective debt issues using the effective interest method 
when debt is repaid early  the portion of unamortized debt issue costs related to the early principal repayment is written off and included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets are primarily the result of our acquisitions in  and we use estimates in determining the value of goodwill and intangible assets  including 
table of contents estimates of useful lives of intangible assets  discounted future cash flows and fair values of the related operations 
we test goodwill for impairment each year as of october st  under the guidance of sfas no 
we forecast discounted future cash flows at the reporting unit level  which consists of our operating groups  based on estimated future revenues and operating costs  which take into consideration factors such as existing backlog  expected future orders  supplier contracts and general market conditions 
changes in our forecasts or cost of capital may result in asset value adjustments  which could have a significant affect on our current and future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized based on estimated discounted cash flows over estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
warranty we generally offer a one year standard warranty on our hardware products and a three month standard warranty on our large application software products 
standard warranty accruals represent the estimated cost of projected warranty claims and are based on historical and projected product performance trends  business volume assumptions  supplier information and other business and economic projections 
thorough testing of new products in the development stage helps identify and correct potential warranty issues prior to manufacturing 
continuing quality control efforts during manufacturing limit our exposure to warranty claims 
if our quality control efforts fail to detect a fault in one of our products  we could experience an increase in warranty claims 
we track warranty claims to identify potential warranty trends 
if an unusual trend is noted  a non standard warranty accrual may be assessed and recorded when a failure event is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
management continually evaluates the sufficiency of the standard and non standard warranty provisions and makes adjustments when necessary 
during and  we added million and million to the accrual and charged million and million  respectively  against the warranty accrual for work performed as a result of a specific component failure 
the standard and non standard warranty allowances may fluctuate due to changes in estimates for material  labor and other costs we may incur to replace projected product failures  and we may incur additional warranty and related expenses in the future with respect to new or established products 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we account for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of sfas and sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in accordance with these standards  every derivative instrument is recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in shareholders equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings 
ineffective portions of changes in fair value of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in the results of operations 
a cash flow hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge 
the expectation of hedge effectiveness must be supported by matching the essential terms of the hedged asset  liability or forecasted transaction to the derivative hedge contract or by effectiveness assessments using statistical measurements 
our policy is to assess actual hedge effectiveness at the end of each calendar quarter 
derivatives are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
refer to note debt for a discussion of our interest rate swap and cap agreements at december  health benefits we are self insured for a substantial portion of the cost of employee group health insurance 
we purchase insurance from a third party  which provides individual and aggregate stop loss protection for these costs 
each reporting period  we record the costs of our health insurance plan  including paid claims  an estimate of the change in incurred but not reported ibnr claims  taxes and administrative fees collectively the plan costs 
the estimated ibnr claims are based upon a recent average level of paid claims under the plan and an estimated lag factor to provide for those claims that have been incurred but not yet paid 
we believe that the assumptions and information used to develop our accruals are reasonable based on historical results 
however  
table of contents significant changes in the various cost factors of our medical and health care costs could have an affect on the determination of the amount of these accruals in future periods 
health insurance expense was approximately million  million and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the health insurance accrual balance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
if the company were to change its assumptions used in estimating the liability by  the affect on net earnings would be approximately  of additional expense 
contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims of which the outcomes are subject to significant uncertainty 
our policy is to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the liability required  if any  for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and related pronouncements 
a liability is recorded when we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
new accounting pronouncements on march   the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus on eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides guidance on when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss 
the guidance also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the provisions of this guidance are applicable to reporting periods beginning after june   except for those provisions covered by fasb staff position no 
 which delayed the effective date 
we have no investments at december  to which this guidance would apply 
in november  the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued  with prospective application only 
we are currently evaluating whether the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material affect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires companies to expense the fair value of equity awards over the required service period 
we have not yet quantified the effects of the adoption of sfas r  but the adoption of sfas r will decrease gross profit and operating expenses and will affect the tax rate 
the pro forma effects on net income loss and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of original sfas no 
on stock compensation awards are disclosed in footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
such pro forma effects of applying the original sfas no 
may be indicative of the effects of adopting sfas r  however the provisions of the two statements differ 
sfas r will be effective for itron s fiscal quarter beginning july   on either a prospective or retrospective basis 
on a prospective basis sfas r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the effective date 
compensation cost related to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no 
the retrospective basis allows for application to all prior years for which the original sfas no 
was effective or only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption 
if the retrospective 
table of contents basis is applied  financial statements for prior periods shall be adjusted to give effect to the fair value based method of accounting for awards on a consistent basis with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods under the original sfas no 
subsequent event as of march   we have made million in optional prepayments on our senior secured credit facility term loan  bringing the outstanding balance to million as of that date 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
weighted average variable rates in the table are based on implied forward rates in the libor yield curve as of january  and our estimated ratio of funded debt to ebitda  which determines our rate margin 
the table below illustrates the scheduled minimum repayment of principal over the remaining lives of our debt at december  beyond in millions interest rate swap notional principal average pay rate average receive rate interest rate cap notional principal fixed cap rate weighted average forward libor rate fixed rate debt project financing debt average interest rate senior subordinated notes average interest rate variable rate debt revolving credit line average interest rate term loan debt average interest rate the interest rate cap is effective in october and expires in september the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes was discounted at to yield  due in there was no balance on the revolving credit line at december  repayment of the term loan is based on minimum contractual terms of the senior secured credit facility and includes an additional million of optional repayments during  which we estimate are necessary to remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
term loan debt average interest rates do not include the effects of the interest rate cap 
the average interest rates including the effect of the interest rate cap are for  for  for  for  for and for the period beyond based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   we estimate that if market interest rates average one percentage point higher than in the table above in  our earnings before income taxes in would decrease by approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis does not include the effects of the interest rate swap 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
our senior secured credit facility required that we enter into an interest rate agreement within days after the closing to substantially fix or limit the interest rate on at least of our aggregate principal amount of debt for a period of not less than three years 
the million interest rate swap increased the percentage of fixed rate debt to at december   which is above the minimum requirement of 
the forecasted interest rates for the term loan debt provided in the tabular format above do not include the benefits of the interest rate swap or cap agreements 

table of contents we purchased an interest rate cap with a notional amount of million for a one time  up front payment of  the cap is effective in october the interest rate cap agreement entitles us to receive payments equal to the notional amount of million  times the excess  if any  of the three month libor over 
the cap expires in september the interest rate cap agreement effectively caps our interest payments on our senior secured term loan  up to the notional amount of the interest rate cap  at four percent 
this mitigates our exposure to increases in interest rates on our senior secured term loan  which is at variable rates 
at december   the cap agreement had a fair market value of approximately  foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in a number of foreign countries and  therefore  face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
international revenues were of our total revenues for the year ended december  since we do not typically use derivative instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks  the consolidated results of operations in us dollars are subject to fluctuation as foreign exchange rates change 
in addition  our foreign currency exchange rate exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material affect on our financial results 
our primary exposure is related to non us dollar denominated sales  cost of sales and operating expenses in our international subsidiary operations 
this means we are subject to changes in the consolidated results of operations expressed in us dollars 
other international business  consisting primarily of shipments from the us to international distributors and customers in the pacific rim and latin america  is predominantly denominated in us dollars  which reduces our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in some cases where sales from the us are not denominated in us dollars  we may hedge our foreign exchange risk by selling the expected foreign currency receipts forward 
there have been  and there may continue to be  large period to period fluctuations in the relative portions of international revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies 
risk sensitive financial instruments in the form of inter company trade receivables are mostly denominated in us dollars  while inter company notes may be denominated in local foreign currencies 
as foreign currency exchange rates change  inter company trade receivables may affect current earnings  while inter company notes may be re valued and result in unrealized translation gains or losses that are reported in other comprehensive income loss 
because our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated 
at december   the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or on the fair value of any risk sensitive financial instruments 
the model assumes foreign currency exchange rates will shift in the same direction and relative amount 
however  exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may result in the overstatement or understatement of the affect of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
consequently  the actual effects on operations in the future may differ materially from results of the analysis for the year ended december  we may  in the future  experience greater fluctuations in us dollar earnings from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we will continue to monitor and assess the affect of currency fluctuations and may institute hedging alternatives
