item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our operations  cash flows  liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
overview we generate revenues and cash flow through the design  production  distribution and sale of branded and private label consumer apparel for men  women  and children and the licensing of company owned trademarks 
our principal markets and customers are located primarily in the united states 
we source more than of our products through third party producers  but also manufacture certain of our products in manufacturing facilities owned directly by us and through joint venture arrangements 
we primarily distribute our products through our wholesale customers including chain stores  department stores  specialty stores  mail order and mass merchandising and also through our own retail stores for some brands 
we operate in an industry that is highly competitive 
our ability to continuously evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes  across multiple market segments  distribution channels and geographic regions is critical to our success 
although our approach is aimed at diversifying our risks  misjudging shifts in consumer 
table of contents preferences could have a negative effect on future operating results 
other key aspects of competition include quality  brand image  distribution methods  price  customer service and intellectual property protection 
our size and global operating strategies help us to successfully compete by positioning us to take advantage of synergies in product design  development  sourcing and distribution of our products 
our success in the future will depend on our ability to continue to design products that are acceptable to the markets that we serve and to source our products on a competitive basis while still earning appropriate margins 
the most significant event in fiscal was the july  acquisition of ben sherman  which we operate as part of our menswear group

the facilities also include limitations on certain restricted payments such as dividends  earn out payments  and prepayment of debt 
to ensure compliance with the minimum availability requirement of our us revolver  we sought and obtained the consent of our us revolver bank group to pay our third and fourth quarter fiscal dividends without regard to the availability requirement 
we currently do not anticipate the need for a consent to pay dividends in subsequent quarters 
as of june   we were compliant with all restrictive financial covenants related to our debt agreements 
we expect to fund the payment of the seller notes  which are due upon demand and expected to be redeemed for payment during the first half of fiscal  with borrowings from the uk revolver 
additionally  the uk revolver is also due upon demand and expires in july at expiration  we anticipate that we will be able to refinance the uk revolver either with the same lender  other lenders or under our us revolver 

table of contents we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements  which generally consist of working capital needs  capital expenditures primarily for the opening of tommy bahama and ben sherman retail stores and interest and principal payments on our debt during fiscal  primarily from cash on hand and cash flow from operations supplemented by borrowings under our lines of credit  as necessary 
our need for working capital is typically seasonal with the greatest requirements generally existing from the late second quarter to early fourth quarter of each year as we build inventory for the spring summer season 
our capital needs will depend on many factors including our growth rate  the need to finance increased inventory levels and the success of our various products 
if appropriate investment opportunities arise that exceed the availability under our existing credit facilities  we believe that we will be able to fund such acquisitions through additional or refinanced debt facilities or the issuance of additional equity 
however  our ability to obtain additional borrowings or refinance our credit facilities will depend on many factors  including the prevailing market conditions  our financial condition and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
there is no assurance that financing would be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
our debt to total capitalization ratio was and at june  and may   respectively 
the change was primarily a result of the additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition of ben sherman on july  we anticipate that the amount of debt  as well as the ratio of debt to total capitalization  will decrease in future periods as a result of anticipated cash flow from operations  unless we make additional acquisitions or investments

off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into agreements which meet the definition of an off balance sheet financing arrangement  other than operating leases  and have made no financial commitments to or guarantees with any unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities 

table of contents critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to receivables  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation and certain other accrued expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that we have appropriately applied our critical accounting policies 
however  in the event that inappropriate assumptions or methods were used relating to the critical accounting policies below  our consolidated statements of earnings could be misstated 
the detailed summary of significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods we use 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our revenue consists of sales to wholesale customers  retail store and restaurant revenues and royalties 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for sales within our wholesale operations  we consider a completed purchase order or some form of electronic communication from the customer requesting the goods persuasive evidence of an agreement 
for substantially all our wholesale sales  our products are considered delivered at the time that the products are shipped from our distribution centers as substantially all products are sold based on fob shipping point terms 
this generally coincides with the time that title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
for certain transactions in which the goods do not pass through our distribution centers and title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass at the time the goods leave the foreign port  revenue is recognized at that time 
in certain cases in which we retain the risk of loss during shipment  revenue recognition does not occur until the goods have reached the specified customer 
retail store and restaurant revenues are recorded  net of estimated returns  at the time of sale to consumers 
in the normal course of business we offer certain discounts or allowances to our wholesale customers 
wholesale operations sales are recorded net of such discounts  allowances provided to our customers  advertising support arrangements not specifically relating to the reimbursement for actual advertising expenses by our customers and provisions for estimated returns 
as certain allowances and other deductions are not finalized until the end of a season  program or other event which may not have occurred yet  we estimate such discounts and allowances on an ongoing basis considering historical and current trends  projected seasonal results and other factors 
we record the discounts  returns and allowances as a reduction to net sales in our consolidated statements of earnings 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken as a reduction to accounts receivable to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
such amounts are written off at the time that the amounts are not considered collectible 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts and uncollectible chargebacks based on our historical collection experience  the financial condition of our customers  an evaluation of current economic conditions and anticipated trends 
we record such charges and write offs to selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings 
inventories for segment reporting  inventory is carried at the lower of fifo cost or market  with all adjustments being charged to operations in the period in which the facts giving rise to the adjustments become known 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventories for identification of distressed inventory 
for wholesale inventory  we estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods 
for retail inventory  we provide an allowance for shrinkage and goods expected to be sold below cost 

table of contents these estimates are based on our historical experience as well as an assessment of the inventory quantity  quality and mix  consumer and retailer preferences and the current market conditions 
for consolidated financial reporting  significant portions of our inventories are valued at the lower of lifo cost or market 
lifo inventory calculations are made on a legal entity basis which does not correspond to our segment definitions 
therefore  lifo inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to the respective operating segments 
as part of lifo accounting  markdowns for inventory valued at lifo cost are deferred until the period in which the goods are sold 
however  in non routine circumstances  such as discontinuance of a product line  markdowns below the allocated lifo reserve are not deferred 
both the lifo reserve and the markdown deferral are reflected in our corporate and other financial information in note to our consolidated financial statements and in the results of operations in our management s discussion and analysis 
goodwill  net goodwill is recognized as the amount that the cost to acquire a company or group of assets exceeds the fair value of assets acquired less any liabilities assumed at acquisition 
such goodwill is allocated to the respective reporting unit at the time of acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired 
the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill includes valuations of each applicable underlying business using fair value techniques and market comparables which may include a discounted cash flow analysis or an independent appraisal 
if this analysis indicates an impairment of goodwill balances  the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
no impairment of goodwill was identified during fiscal  or intangible assets  net at acquisition  we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets  which primarily consist of trademarks and trade names  license agreements and customer relationships 
the fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals in some cases 
amortization of intangible assets with finite lives  which consist of license agreements  customer relationships and covenants not to compete  is recognized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized  which is up to years for some intangible assets 
intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if expected future undiscounted cash flows from operations are less than their carrying amounts  an asset is determined to be impaired and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
during fiscal  and  no material impairments relating to intangible assets with finite lives was recognized 
trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
the evaluation of the recoverability of intangible assets with indefinite lives includes valuations based on a discounted cash flow analysis or an independent appraisal 
if this analysis indicates an impairment of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life  the amount of the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
no impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives was identified during fiscal  or income taxes we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the difference between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the period in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled 
our policy is to recognize net deferred tax assets  whose realization is dependent on taxable earnings in future years  when a greater than percent probability exists that the tax benefits will actually be realized sometime in the future and provide for a reserve for items when a greater than probability exists that a tax deduction taken would be disallowed under examination by the taxing authority 
no material valuation allowances have been recognized in our financial statements 

table of contents we have undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately million which have been provided for in our income tax provision as the earnings are not considered permanently invested outside of the united states 
if the earnings were repatriated to the united states  the earnings will be subject to united states taxation at that time 
the amount of deferred tax liability recognized associated with the undistributed earnings was approximately million at june   representing the approximate excess of the united states tax liability over the creditable foreign taxes paid that would result from a full remittance of undistributed earnings 
we receive a united states income tax benefit upon the exercise of the majority of our employee stock options 
the benefit is equal to the difference between the fair market value of the stock at the time of the exercise and the option price  times the approximate tax rate 
we record the benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options as a reduction to current income taxes payable and a credit directly to shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
seasonality although our various product lines are sold on a year round basis  the demand for specific products or styles may be highly seasonal 
for example  the demand for golf and tommy bahama products is higher in the spring and summer seasons 
products are sold prior to each of our retail selling seasons  including spring  summer  fall and holiday 
as the timing of product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year 
the percentage of net sales distribution by quarter for fiscal was   and  respectively  and the net earnings by quarter for fiscal were   and  respectively  which may not be indicative of the distribution in future years 
future accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb statement no 
inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
chapter fas 
fas is applicable for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  fas requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and re handling be recognized as current period charges rather than being included in inventory regardless of whether the costs meet the criterion of abnormal as defined in arb we do not believe the adoption of fas will have a material impact on us upon adoption in fiscal as we have historically expensed such costs as incurred 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and fas r 
fas r is applicable for fiscal periods beginning after june  fas r sets accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees  requires companies to recognize in the statement of earnings the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and disallows the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock compensation 
we are currently evaluating the impact that fas r will have on our results of operations upon adoption in fiscal in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law by the president 
among other provisions  the act provides for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated in either an enterprise s last tax year that began before the enactment date or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the date of enactment 
as a result of execution of the act  the accounting treatment of such unremitted earnings that are expected to be repatriated must be considered in evaluating an entity s tax provision 
we are currently evaluating the appropriate action with respect to the repatriation provision 
as we have not completed this assessment  no impact of repatriation has been recognized in our fiscal tax provision or consolidated financial statements 
we expect to have this evaluation completed during fiscal 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our indebtedness  which could impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
our objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow  primarily through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
this assessment also considers our need for flexibility in our borrowing arrangements resulting from the seasonality of our business  among other factors 
we continuously monitor interest rates to consider the sources and terms of our borrowing facilities in order to determine whether we have achieved our interest rate management objectives 
as of june   approximately million of debt outstanding or of our total debt was subject to variable interest rates  with a weighted average rate of approximately at june  our average variable rate borrowings for fiscal were million  with an average interest rate of during the year 
our lines of credit are based on variable interest rates in order to take advantage of the lower rates available in the current interest rate environment and to provide the necessary borrowing flexibility required 
to the extent that the amounts outstanding under our variable rate lines of credit change  our exposure to changes in interest rates would also change 
if the fiscal average interest rate increased by basis points  our interest expense would have been approximately million higher during the fiscal year 
at june   we had approximately million of fixed rate debt and capital lease obligations outstanding with substantially all the debt having an effective interest rate of and maturing in june such agreements may result in higher interest expense than could be obtained under variable interest rate arrangements in certain periods of lower variable interest rates  but are primarily intended to provide long term financing of our capital structure and minimize our exposure to increases in interest rates 
a change in the market interest rate impacts the net financial instrument position of our fixed rate debt but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
none of our debt was entered into for speculative purposes 
we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our interest rate risk and do not enter into such transactions on a speculative basis 
trade policy risk pursuant to the agreement on textiles and clothing  quotas among world trade organization wto member countries  including the united states  were eliminated on january  as a result  the international textile and apparel trade is undergoing a significant realignment which is changing our sourcing patterns  could disrupt our supply chain and could put us at a disadvantage to our competitors 
in addition  notwithstanding quota elimination  under the terms of china s wto accession agreement  the united states and other wto members may re impose quotas on specific categories of products in the event it is determined that imports from china have surged or may surge and are threatening to create a market disruption for such categories of products so called safeguard quota 
pursuant to this authority both the united states and the european union have re imposed quotas on several important product categories from china and may re impose quotas on additional categories in the future 
the imposition of these safeguard quotas could cause disruption in our supply chain 
furthermore  under long standing statutory authority applicable to imported goods in general  the united states may unilaterally impose additional duties i when imported merchandise is sold at less than fair value and causes material injury  or threatens to cause material injury  to the domestic industry producing a comparable product generally known as anti dumping duties  or ii when foreign producers receive certain types of governmental subsidies  and when the importation of their subsidized goods causes material injury  or threatens to cause material injury  to the domestic industry producing a comparable product generally known as countervailing duties 
the imposition of anti dumping or countervailing duties on products we import would increase the cost of those products to us 
we may not be able to pass on any such cost increase to our customers 
the recently adopted central american dominican republic free trade agreement as well as several other pending free trade agreements could put us at a disadvantage to some of our competitors 

table of contents foreign currency risk to the extent that we have assets and liabilities  as well as operations  denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged  we are subject to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we receive united states dollars for substantially all of our product sales  except for ben sherman sales in the united kingdom and europe and certain licensing fees earned in foreign countries 
we view our net investment in the ben sherman united kingdom subsidiary  which has a functional currency of pounds sterling  as long term 
as a result  we generally do not hedge this investment 
ben sherman sales that were not denominated in united states dollars totaled million during fiscal  which represented approximately of our total sales for fiscal with the dollar trading at a weaker position than it has historically traded average rate of for the period since our acquisition of ben sherman  a strengthening united states dollar could result in lower levels of sales in the consolidated statements of earnings in future periods  although the sales in pounds sterling could be equal to or greater than amounts as previously reported 
substantially all inventory purchases from contract manufacturers throughout the world are denominated in united states dollars 
purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies eg the chinese yuan of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future 
due to the number of currencies involved and the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner against the united states dollar  we cannot quantify in any meaningful way the potential effect of such fluctuations on future income 
however  we do not believe that exchange rate fluctuations will have a material impact on our inventory costs in future periods 
we may from time to time purchase united states dollar forward exchange contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates  but at june   we have not entered into any such agreements that have not been settled 
when such contracts are outstanding  the contracts are marked to market with the offset being recognized in our consolidated statement of earnings or other comprehensive income depending upon whether the transaction qualifies as a hedge in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
commodity and inflation risk we are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through the purchase of raw materials and finished goods and increased operating costs to the extent that any such fluctuations are not reflected by adjustments in the selling prices of our products timely  or at all 
also  in recent years  there has been deflationary pressure on selling prices in our private label businesses 
while we have been successful to some extent in offsetting such deflationary pressures through product improvements and lower costs  if deflationary price trends outpace our ability to obtain further price reductions  our profitability may be affected 
inflation deflation risks are managed by each business unit through selective price increases when possible  productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives 
we do not enter into significant long term sales or purchase contracts and we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such risk
