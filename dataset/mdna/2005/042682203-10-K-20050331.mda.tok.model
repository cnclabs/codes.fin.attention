the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report  and the notes thereto 
we have rounded amounts reported here to the nearest thousand  unless such amounts are more than million  in which event we have rounded such amounts to the nearest hundred thousand 
general we are a defense and security products and services company  engaged in three business areas interactive simulation for military  law enforcement and commercial markets  batteries and charging systems for the military  and high level armoring for military  paramilitary and commercial vehicles 
until september   we were known as electric fuel corporation 
we operate in three business units we develop  manufacture and market advanced hi tech multimedia and interactive digital solutions for use of force and driving training of military  law enforcement  security and other personnel  as well as offering security consulting and other services our simulation  security and consulting division  we manufacture aviation armor and we utilize sophisticated lightweight materials and advanced engineering processes to armor vehicles our armoring division  and we manufacture and sell zinc air and lithium batteries for defense and security products and other military applications and we pioneer advancements in zinc air battery technology for electric vehicles our battery and power systems division 
during  we acquired three new businesses faac corporation  located in ann arbor  michigan  which provides simulators  systems engineering and software products to the united states military  government and private industry which we have placed in our simulation and security division  epsilor electronic industries  ltd  located in dimona  israel  which develops and sells rechargeable and primary lithium batteries and smart chargers to the military and to private industry in the middle east  europe and asia which we have placed in our battery and power systems division  and armour of america  incorporated  located in los angeles  california  which manufacturers aviation armor both for helicopters and for fixed wing aircraft  marine armor  personnel armor  armoring kits for military vehicles  fragmentation blankets and a unique ballistic flotation vest armourfloat that is us coast guard certified  which we have placed in our armor division 
prior to the acquisition of faac and epsilor  we were organized into two divisions defense and security products consisting of ies  mdt and mdt armor  and electric fuel batteries consisting of efl and efb 
our financial results for do not include the activities of faac  epsilor or aoa and therefore are not directly comparable to our financial results for restatement of previously issued financial statements during our management s review of our interim financial statements for the period ended september   we  after discussion with and based on a new and revised review of accounting treatment by our independent auditors  conducted a comprehensive review of the re pricing of warrants and grant of new warrants to certain of our investors and others during the years and as a result of that review  we  upon recommendation of our management and with the approval of the audit committee of our board of directors after discussion with our independent auditors  reconsidered the accounting related to these transactions and reclassified certain expenses as a deemed dividend  a non cash item  instead of as general and administrative expenses due to the recognition of these transactions as capital transactions that should not be expensed 
these restatements did not affect our balance sheet  shareholders equity or cash flow statements 
in addition and as a result of the remeasurement described above  we have reviewed assumptions used in the calculation of fair value of all warrants granted during the year as a result of this comprehensive review  we have decreased general and administrative expenses in the amount of  related to errors found in the valuation of warrants granted in the litigation settlement described in note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in addition  during our management s review of our interim financial statements for the period ended september   we also reviewed our calculation of amortization of debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature associated with our convertible debentures 
as a result of this review  we found errors which increased our financial expenses in the amount of  for the year ended december  the errors were related to the amortization of debt discount attributable to the warrants and the related convertible debentures  whereby we understated the amount of amortization for the year ended december  attributable to certain of the convertible debentures 
similar errors were also noted in our interim financial statements in the three month period ended june   the nine month period ended september   and the three and six month periods ended march and june the impacts of these restatements with respect to the year ended december  are summarized below statement of operations data for the year ended december  previously reported adjustment as restated general and administrative expenses    operating loss    financial expenses  net    loss from continuing operations    net loss    deemed dividend to certain stockholders of common stock   net loss attributable to common stockholders    basic and diluted net loss per share from continuing operations basic and diluted net loss per share balance sheet data as of december  previously reported adjustment as restated other accounts payable and accrued    expenses total current liabilities    convertible debenture    total long term liabilities    additional paid in capital    accumulated deficit    total shareholders equity    cash flow data for the year ended december  previously reported adjustment as restated net loss    stock based compensation related to repricing of warrants granted to investors and the grant of new warrants    increase in other accounts payable and accrued expenses    amortization of compensation related to beneficial conversion feature and warrants issued to holders of convertible debentures    critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for bad debts  inventory  contingencies and warranty reserves  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management s estimates change on the basis of development of the business or market conditions 
management judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically 
a portion of our revenue is derived from license agreements that entail the customization of faac s simulators to the customer s specific requirements 
revenues from initial license fees for such arrangements are recognized in accordance with statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts based on the percentage of completion method over the period from signing of the license through to customer acceptance  as such simulators require significant modification or customization that takes time to complete 
the percentage of completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated project requirement  which corresponds to the costs related to earned revenues 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
we believe that the use of the percentage of completion method is appropriate as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
in addition  contracts executed include provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding services to be provided and received by the parties to the contracts  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
in all cases we expect to perform our contractual obligations and our licensees are expected to satisfy their obligations under the contract 
the complexity of the estimation process and the issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and specification and testing requirement changes 
we account for our other revenues from ies simulators in accordance with the provisions of sop  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants and as amended by sop and sop and related interpretations 
we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
we assess whether collection is probable at the time of the transaction based on a number of factors  including the customer s past transaction history and credit worthiness 
if we determine that the collection of the fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables 
in determining the provision  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
we reassess these allowances each accounting period 
historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
if actual payment experience with our customers is different than our estimates  adjustments to these allowances may be necessary resulting in additional charges to our statement of operations 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters may be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income loss in the period in which such determination is made 
we have provided a valuation allowance on the majority of our net deferred tax assets  which includes federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses in certain jurisdictions and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
the company and its subsidiaries provide valuation allowances in respect of deferred tax assets resulting principally from the carryforward of tax losses 
management currently believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax regarding the carryforward of losses and certain accrued expenses will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
the company does not provide for us federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are re invested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be re invested indefinitely 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and may be subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time for resolution 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
inventories our policy for valuation of inventory and commitments to purchase inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  valuation of existing inventory  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our revenue forecast  which is also used for our short term manufacturing plans 
inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we may be required to record additional inventory write down if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management 
for fiscal  no significant changes were made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of inventory valuation or the methodology applied 
goodwill under financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests based on estimated fair value in accordance with sfas in june  we completed our annual impairment test and assessed the carrying value of goodwill as required by sfas the goodwill impairment test compared the carrying value of the company s reporting units with the fair value at that date 
because the market capitalization exceeded the carrying value significantly  no impairment arose 
we determine fair value using discounted cash flow analysis 
this type of analysis requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we may be required to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if our estimates or their related assumptions change in subsequent periods or if actual cash flows are below our estimates  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
other intangible assets other intangible assets are amortized to the statement of operations over the period during which benefits are expected to accrue  currently estimated at two to ten years 
we recorded a  impairment charge in in respect of certain technology acquired from bristlecone in the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make assumptions regarding future business conditions and operating results in order to estimate future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record additional impairment charges 
contingencies we are from time to time involved in legal proceedings and other claims 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for any contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change due to future developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in the settlement strategy in dealing with any contingencies  which may result in higher net loss 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
warranty reserves upon shipment of products to our customers  we provide for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty 
our warranty period is typically twelve months from the date of shipment to the end user customer 
for existing products  the reserve is estimated based on actual historical experience 
for new products  the warranty reserve is based on historical experience of similar products until such time as sufficient historical data has been collected on the new product 
factors that may impact our warranty costs in the future include our reliance on our contract manufacturer to provide quality products and the fact that our products are complex and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures in either the hardware or the software 
functional currency we consider the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which we and our israeli subsidiary efl operate and  therefore  both we and efl have adopted and are using the united states dollar as our functional currency 
transactions and balances originally denominated in us dollars are presented at the original amounts 
gains and losses arising from non dollar transactions and balances are included in net income 
the majority of financial transactions of our israeli subsidiaries mdt and epsilor is in new israel shekels nis and a substantial portion of mdt s and epsilor s costs is incurred in nis 
management believes that the nis is the functional currency of mdt and epsilor 
accordingly  the financial statements of mdt and epsilor have been translated into us dollars 
all balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statement of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity

overview of results of operations we incurred significant operating losses for the years ended december   and while we expect to continue to derive revenues from the sale of products that we manufacture and the services that we provide  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a consistent basis 
during and  we substantially increased our revenues and reduced our net loss  from million in to million in to million in this was achieved through a combination of cost cutting measures and increased revenues  particularly from the sale of zinc air batteries to the military and from sales of products manufactured by the subsidiaries we acquired in and we succeeded during in moving arotech to a positive ebitda situation  for the first time in our history 
we are focused on continuing this success in and beyond  and ultimately on achieving profitability 
in this connection  we note that most of our business lines historically have had weaker first halves than second halves  and weaker first quarters than second quarters 
we expect this to be the case for as well 
a portion of our operating loss during and arose as a result of non cash charges 
these charges were primarily related to our acquisitions  financings and issuances of restricted shares and options to employees 
because we anticipate continuing certain of these activities during  we expect to continue to incur such non cash charges in the future 
acquisitions in acquisition of subsidiaries  part of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and goodwill  amortization of intangible assets related to acquisition of subsidiaries is recorded based on the estimated expected life of the assets 
accordingly  for a period of time following an acquisition  we incur a non cash charge related to amortization of intangible assets in the amount of a fraction based on the useful life of the intangible assets of the amount recorded as intangible assets 
such amortization charges will continue during we are required to review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we determine  through the impairment review process  that intangible asset has been impaired  we must record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
in the case of goodwill  the assets recorded as goodwill are not amortized  instead  we are required to perform an annual impairment review 
if we determine  through the impairment review process  that goodwill has been impaired  we must record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rule  we incurred non cash charges for amortization of intangible assets and impairment in the amount of million during see critical accounting policies other intangible assets  above 
financings the non cash charges that relate to our financings occurred in connection with our issuance of convertible debentures with warrants  and in connection with our repricing of certain warrants and grants of new warrants 
when we issue convertible debentures  we record a discount for a beneficial conversion feature that is amortized ratably over the life of the debenture 
when a debenture is converted  however  the entire remaining unamortized beneficial conversion feature expense is immediately recognized in the quarter in which the debenture is converted 
similarly  when we issue warrants in connection with convertible debentures  we record debt discount for financial expenses that is amortized ratably over the term of the convertible debentures  when the convertible debentures are converted  the entire remaining unamortized debt discount is immediately recognized in the quarter in which the convertible debentures are converted 
as and to the extent that our remaining convertible debentures are converted  we would incur similar non cash charges going forward 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rule  we incurred non cash charges related to amortization of debt discount attributable to beneficial conversion feature in the amount of million during additionally  in an effort to improve our cash situation and our shareholders equity  and in order to reduce the number of our outstanding warrants  during and we induced holders of certain of our warrants to exercise their warrants by lowering the exercise price of the warrants to approximately market value in exchange for immediate exercise of such warrants  and by issuing to such investors a lower number of new warrants at a higher exercise price 
under such circumstances  we record a deemed dividend in an amount determined based upon the fair value of the new warrants 
as and to the extent that we engage in similar warrant repricings and issuances in the future  we would incur similar non cash charges 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rule  we recorded a deemed dividend related to warrants repricing and grant of new warrants in the amount of million during restricted share and option issuances during  we issued restricted shares to certain of our employees 
these shares were issued as stock bonuses  and are restricted for a period of two years from the date of issuance 
relevant accounting rules provide that the aggregate amount of the difference between the purchase price of the restricted shares in this case  generally zero and the market price of the shares on the date of grant is taken as a general and administrative expense  amortized over the life of the period of the restriction 
additionally  during and we issued options to employees that were subject to shareholder approval of a new stock option plan 
while the options were issued at the market price of our stock on the respective dates of issuance  they were not considered by applicable accounting rules to have been finally issued until the date shareholder approval for the new stock option plan was obtained 
in the interim  the market price of our stock had risen  and thus the options were deemed to have been issued at a below market price 
we were therefore required to take as a general and administrative expense the aggregate difference between the option exercise prices of the options and the market price of the shares on the date shareholder approval was obtained  amortized over the vesting periods of the options 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rules  we incurred non cash charges related to stock based compensation in the amount of  during overview of financial condition and operating performance we shut down our money losing consumer battery operations and began acquiring new businesses in the defense and security field in thereafter  we concentrated on eliminating our operating deficit and moving arotech to cash flow positive operations  a goal we achieved for the first time in our history in the second half of in order to do this  we focused on acquiring businesses with strong revenues and profitable operations 
in our simulation and security division  revenues grew from approximately million in to million in on a pro forma basis  assuming we had owned all components of our simulation and security division since january   revenues would have grown from approximately million in to million in 
we attribute this to a number of substantial orders  such as orders from the us army and the chicago transit authority 
as of december   our backlog for our simulation and security division totaled million 
our armor division had record revenues during  with revenues growing from approximately million in to million in on a pro forma basis  assuming we had owned all components of our armor division since january   revenues would have grown from approximately million in to million in 
much of this growth was attributable to armoring orders connected with the war in iraq 
as of december   our backlog for our armor division totaled million 
in our battery and power systems division  revenues grew from approximately million in to million in on a pro forma basis  assuming we had owned all components of our battery and power systems division since january   revenues would have fallen from approximately million in to million in 
as of december   our backlog for our battery and power systems division totaled million

adjusted ebitda in this item  we use the term adjusted ebitda 
each reference to adjusted ebitda herein is qualified by reference to  and should be read in conjunction with  this section and the reconciliation contained herein 
adjusted ebitda  as used herein  is defined as earnings before income taxes  interest expenses  depreciation and amortization  as adjusted to eliminate certain non cash charges 
adjusted ebitda is provided solely as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it enhances overall understanding of our current financial performance and our progress toward cash flow break even and toward gaap profitability 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure as defined in sec regulation g 
adjusted ebitda is presented because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of cash flow break even and debt service capability 
we use adjusted ebitda to set targets and monitor and assess financial performance 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation 
it is not intended to represent cash flows for the periods presented  nor has it been presented as an alternative to net loss as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the most nearly comparable gaap measure to adjusted ebitda is net income or loss

revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to the following factors increased revenues from vehicle armoring  and revenues generated by faac  epsilor and aoa in that were not present in these increases were offset to some extent by decreased revenues from sales of interactive use of force training systems and decreased revenues from sales of our zinc air military batteries 
in  revenues were million for the simulation and security division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to the added revenues from sales of driver training systems since we acquired faac approximately million  offset to some extent by decreased revenues from use of force training systems  million for the armor division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to increased revenues from vehicle armoring and to the added revenues from aircraft armoring since we acquired aoa  and million for the battery and power systems division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to the added revenues from sales of lithium batteries and chargers since we acquired epsilor approximately million  offset to some extent by decreased revenues from our zinc air military batteries 
cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues totaled million during  compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due to increased cost of goods sold  particularly in the armor division partly as a result of our beginning to sell pre armored vehicles in  which requires us to purchase vehicles for pre armoring and in the simulation and security division  as well as the inclusion of the cost of goods of faac  epsilor and aoa in our results for but not direct expenses for our three divisions during were million for the simulation and security division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to the addition of expenses associated with sales of driver training systems through faac approximately million  offset to some extent by decreased expenses associated with the sales of use of force training systems  million for the armor division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to increased expenses associated with sales of vehicle armoring a million increase in  including the expenses of purchasing vehicles for pre armoring in  which was not present in  and to the addition beginning in august of expenses associated with sales of aircraft armoring through our new subsidiary aoa  and million for the battery and power systems division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to the addition of expenses associated with sales of lithium batteries and chargers through our new epsilor subsidiary million  offset to some extent by decreased expenses associated with the sales of zinc air military batteries 
gross profit was million during  compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
this increase was the direct result of all factors presented above  most notably the inclusion of faac  epsilor and aoa in our results for million  as well as the increased revenues from vehicle armoring million  offset to some extent by a decrease of million in gross profit from ies 
research and development expenses

fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
during  we through our subsidiaries recognized revenues as follows ies recognized revenues from the sale of interactive use of force training systems and from the provision of warranty services in connection with such systems  mdt recognized revenues from payments under vehicle armoring contracts and for service and repair of armored vehicles  efb recognized revenues from the sale of batteries and adapters to the military  and under certain development contracts with the us army  arocon recognized revenues under consulting agreements  and efl recognized revenues from the sale of lifejacket lights and from subcontracting fees received in connection with phase iii of the united states department of transportation dot electric bus program  which began in october and was completed in march phase iv of the dot program  which began in october  did not result in any revenues during revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of increased sales attributable to ies and efb  as well as the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results for the full year of but only part of in  revenues were million for the simulation and security division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to the inclusion of ies in our results for the full year of but only part of  million for the battery and power systems division compared to million in the comparable period in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to increased sales to the us army on the part of efb  and million for the armor division compared to million in  an increase of  or  due primarily to the inclusion of mdt in our results for the full year of but only part of 
cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues totaled million during  compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due to increased cost of goods sold  particularly by ies and efb  as well as the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results for the full year of but only part of direct expenses for our three divisions during were million for the simulation and security division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to increased sales attributable to the inclusion of ies in our results for the full year of but only part of  million for the battery and power systems division compared to million in the comparable period in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to increased sales on the part of efb to the us army  and million for the armor division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to the inclusion of mdt in our results for the full year of but only part of 
gross profit was million during  compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
this increase was the direct result of all factors presented above  most notably the increased sales of ies and efb  as well as the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results for the full year of but only part of in  ies contributed million to our gross profit  efb contributed million  and mdt contributed  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for were million  compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily because certain research and development personnel who had worked on the discontinued consumer battery operations during the expenses of which are not reflected in the number above were reassigned to military battery research and development in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for were million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to the following factors the inclusion of the sales and marketing expenses of ies and mdt in our results for the full year of but only part of  an increase in ies s sales activity during  which resulted in both increased sales and increased sales and marketing expenses during  and we incurred expenses for consultants in the amount of  in connection with our cecom battery program with the us army and  in connection with our security consulting business 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for were million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to the following factors the inclusion of the general and administrative expenses of ies and mdt in our results for the full year of but only part of  expenses in in connection with a litigation settlement agreement  in the amount of  that were not present in  expenses in in connection with warrant grants  in the amount of  that were not present in legal and consulting expenses in in connection with our convertible debentures  in the amount of  that were not present in  and expenses in in connection with the start up of our security consulting business in the united states and with the beginning of operations of mdt armor  in the amount of  that were not present in adjusted ebitda 
due to the factors cited above  we had adjusted ebitda of million in  compared to adjusted ebitda of million in for an explanation of adjusted ebitda  a non gaap measure  and a reconciliation with the most nearly comparable gaap measure  see results of operations preliminary note adjusted ebitda  above 
financial income expense 
financial expense totaled approximately million in compared to financial income of  in  an increase of million 
this increase was due primarily to amortization of compensation related to the issuance of convertible debentures issued in december and during in the amount of million  and interest expenses related to those debentures in the amount of  tax expenses 
we and our israeli subsidiary efl incurred net operating losses during and and  accordingly  we were not required to make any provision for income taxes 
mdt and ies had taxable income  and accordingly we were required to make provision for income taxes in the amount of  in we were able to offset ies s federal taxes against our loss carryforwards 
in we did not accrue any tax expenses due to our belief that we would be able to utilize our loss carryforwards against mdt s taxable income  estimation was revised in of the amount accrued in  approximately  was accrued on account of income in amortization of intangible assets and in process research and development 
amortization of intangible assets totaled  in  compared to  in  an increase of  or  resulting from amortization of these assets subsequent to our acquisition of ies and mdt in of this  increase   was attributable to ies and  was attributable to mdt 
loss from continuing operations 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss from continuing operations of million in  compared to a net loss of million in  an increase of million  or 
profit loss from discontinued operations 
in the third quarter of  we decided to discontinue operations relating to the retail sales of our consumer battery products 
accordingly  all revenues and expenses related to this segment have been presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and in an item entitled loss from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations in was  compared to a loss of million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease was the result of the elimination of the losses from these discontinued operations beginning with the fourth quarter of the income from discontinued operations was primarily from cancellation of past accruals made unnecessary by the closing of the discontinued operations 
net loss before deemed dividend 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss before deemed dividend of million in  compared to a net loss of million in  a decrease of million  or 
net loss after deemed dividend of common stock to certain stockholders 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss after deemed dividend of million in  compared to a net loss of million in  a decrease of million  or 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  million in restricted collateral securities and restricted held to maturity securities due within one year  million in long term restricted deposits  and  in available for sale marketable securities  as compared to at december   when we had million in cash and  in restricted cash deposits due within one year 
the decrease in cash was primarily the result of the costs of the acquisitions of faac  epsilor and aoa  and working capital needed in our other segments 
we used available funds in primarily for acquisitions  sales and marketing  continued research and development expenditures  and other working capital needs 
we increased our investment in fixed assets by million during the year ended december   primarily in the battery and power systems division and in the simulation and security division 
our net fixed assets amounted to million as at year end 
net cash used in operating activities for and was  and million  respectively  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was primarily the result of an increase in our adjusted net income in net income in statement of operations less non cash charges such as depreciation  amortization  non cash financial expenses and non cash expenses related to options and warrants 
net cash used in investing activities for and was million and million  respectively  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily the result of our investment in the acquisition of faac  epsilor and aoa in net cash provided by financing activities for and was million and million  respectively  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of higher amounts of funds raised through sales of our securities in compared to during  certain of our employees exercised options under our registered employee stock option plan 
the proceeds to us from the exercised options were approximately million 
we have approximately million in long term debt outstanding not including accrued severance pay  of which million was related to convertible debt unamortized financial expenses related to the beneficial conversion feature of these convertible debentures amounted to approximately million at year end  and approximately million in short term debt not including trade payables and other accounts payable  of which million relates to the earn out provision in connection with our acquisition of faac 
our debt agreements contain customary affirmative and negative operations covenants that limit the discretion of our management with respect to certain business matters and place restrictions on us  including obligations on our part to preserve and maintain our assets and restrictions on our ability to incur or guarantee debt  to merge with or sell our assets to another company  and to make significant capital expenditures without the consent of the debenture holders  as well as granting to our investors a right of first refusal on any future financings  except for underwritten public offerings in excess of million 
we do not believe that this right of first refusal will materially limit our ability to undertake future financings 
based on our internal forecasts  we believe that our present cash position and anticipated cash flows from operations should be sufficient to satisfy our current estimated cash requirements through at least the twelve months 
this belief is based on certain assumptions that our management believes to be reasonable  some of which are subject to the risk factors detailed below 
over the long term  we will need to become profitable  at least on a cash flow basis  and maintain that profitability in order to avoid future capital requirements 
additionally  we would need to raise additional capital in order to fund any future acquisitions 
effective corporate tax rate we and certain of our subsidiaries incurred net operating losses during the years ended december   and  and accordingly no provision for income taxes was required 
with respect to some of our us subsidiaries that operated at a net profit during  we were able to offset federal taxes against our net operating loss carryforward  which amounted to million as of december  these subsidiaries are  however  subject to state taxes that cannot be offset against our net operating loss carryforward 
with respect to certain of our israeli subsidiaries that operated at a net profit during  we were unable to offset their taxes against our net operating loss carryforward  and we are therefore exposed to israeli taxes  at a rate of up to less  in the case of companies that have approved enterprise status as discussed in note to the notes to financial statements 
as of december   we had a us net operating loss carryforward of approximately million that is available to offset future taxable income under certain circumstances  expiring primarily from through  and foreign net operating and capital loss carryforwards of approximately million  which are available indefinitely to offset future taxable income under certain circumstances 
contractual obligations the following table lists our contractual obligations and commitments as of december   not including trade payables and other accounts payable contractual obligations payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt   short term debt   operating lease obligations     severance obligations     includes convertible debentures in the gross amount of  unamortized financial expenses related to the beneficial conversion feature of these convertible debentures amounted to  at year end 
includes sums owed in respect of an earn out provision related to our acquisition of faac  in the amount of million 
includes obligations related to special severance pay arrangements in addition to the severance amounts due to certain employees pursuant to israeli severance pay law 
risk factors the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
business related risks we have had a history of losses and may incur future losses 
we were incorporated in and began our operations in we have funded our operations principally from funds raised in each of the initial public offering of our common stock in february  through subsequent public and private offerings of our common stock and equity and debt securities convertible or exercisable into shares of our common stock  research contracts and supply contracts  funds received under research and development grants from the government of israel  and sales of products that we and our subsidiaries manufacture 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
additionally  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to achieve or maintain profitability consistently or that our business will continue to exist 
our existing indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional funds and may increase our vulnerability to economic or business downturns 
our bank and certificated indebtedness aggregated approximately million as of december  accordingly  we are subject to the risks associated with indebtedness  including o we must dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs and  as a result  we have less funds available for operations  future acquisitions of consumer receivable portfolios  and other purposes  o it may be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional funds through financings  if available at all  o we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and fluctuations in interest rates  less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in reacting to changes in our industry and general economic conditions  and o if we default under any of our existing debt instruments or if our creditors demand payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness  we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments 
the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our stock price 
the agreements governing the terms of our debentures contain numerous affirmative and negative covenants that limit the discretion of our management with respect to certain business matters and place restrictions on us  including obligations on our part to preserve and maintain our assets and restrictions on our ability to incur or guarantee debt  to merge with or sell our assets to another company  and to make significant capital expenditures without the consent of the debenture holders 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of such agreements may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
failure to comply with the terms of our debentures could result in a default that could have material adverse consequences for us 
a failure to comply with the obligations contained in our debenture agreements could result in an event of default under such agreements which could result in an acceleration of the debentures and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the indebtedness under the debentures or other indebtedness were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness 
we have pledged a substantial portion of our assets to secure our borrowings 
our debentures are secured by a substantial portion of our assets 
if we default under the indebtedness secured by our assets  those assets would be available to the secured creditors to satisfy our obligations to the secured creditors  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our stock price 
we need significant amounts of capital to operate and grow our business 
we require substantial funds to market our products and develop and market new products 
to the extent that we are unable to fully fund our operations through profitable sales of our products and services  we may continue to seek additional funding  including through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain any such additional financing in a timely manner  on acceptable terms  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  stockholders may incur further dilution 
if additional funding is not secured  we will have to modify  reduce  defer or eliminate parts of our anticipated future commitments and or programs 
we may not be successful in operating new businesses 
prior to the acquisitions of ies and mdt in and the acquisitions of faac and epsilor in january and aoa in august  our primary business was the marketing and sale of products based on primary and refuelable zinc air fuel cell technology and advancements in battery technology for defense and security products and other military applications  electric vehicles and consumer electronics 
as a result of our acquisitions  a substantial component of our business is the marketing and sale of hi tech multimedia and interactive training solutions and sophisticated lightweight materials and advanced engineering processes used to armor vehicles 
these are relatively new businesses for us and our management group has limited experience operating these types of businesses 
although we have retained our acquired companies management personnel  we cannot assure that such personnel will continue to work for us or that we will be successful in managing these new businesses 
if we are unable to successfully operate these new businesses  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially impaired 
our acquisition strategy involves various risks 
part of our strategy is to grow through the acquisition of companies that will complement our existing operations or provide us with an entry into markets we do not currently serve 
growth through acquisitions involves substantial risks  including the risk of improper valuation of the acquired business and the risk of inadequate integration 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition candidates will be available  that we will be able to acquire or manage profitably such additional companies or that future acquisitions will produce returns that justify our investments therein 
in addition  we may compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies that have significantly greater resources than we do 
furthermore  acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business  distract the attention of our senior officers  make it difficult to maintain our operational standards  controls and procedures and subject us to contingent and latent risks that are different  in nature and magnitude  than the risks we currently face 
we may finance future acquisitions with cash from operations or additional debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate internal cash or obtain financing from external sources or that  if available  such financing will be on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of additional common stock to finance acquisitions may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
any debt financing may significantly increase our leverage and may involve restrictive covenants which limit our operations 
we may not successfully integrate our acquisitions 
in light of our acquisitions of ies  mdt  faac  epsilor and aoa  our success will depend in part on our ability to manage the combined operations of these companies and to integrate the operations and personnel of these companies along with our other subsidiaries and divisions into a single organizational structure 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively integrate the operations of our subsidiaries and divisions and our acquired businesses into a single organizational structure 
integration of these operations could also place additional pressures on our management as well as on our key technical resources 
the failure to successfully manage this integration could have an adverse material effect on us 
if we are successful in acquiring additional businesses  we may experience a period of rapid growth that could place significant additional demands on  and require us to expand  our management  resources and management information systems 
our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our operating results will be impaired 
as a result of our acquisitions  we are currently experiencing a period of significant growth and development activity which could place a significant strain on our personnel and resources 
our activity has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
many of our management personnel have had limited or no experience in managing growing companies 
we have sought to manage our current and anticipated growth through the recruitment of additional management and technical personnel and the implementation of internal systems and controls 
however  our failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our results of operations 
a significant portion of our business is dependent on government contracts and reduction or reallocation of defense or law enforcement spending could reduce our revenues 
many of the customers of ies  faac and aoa to date have been in the public sector of the us  including the federal  state and local governments  and in the public sectors of a number of other countries  and most of mdt s customers have been in the public sector in israel  in particular the ministry of defense 
additionally  all of efb s sales to date of battery products for the military and defense sectors have been in the public sector in the united states 
a significant decrease in the overall level or allocation of defense or law enforcement spending in the us or other countries could reduce our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
mdt has already experienced a slowdown in orders from the ministry of defense due to budget constraints and a requirement of us aid to israel that a substantial proportion of such aid be spent in the us  where mdt has only recently opened a factory 
sales to public sector customers are subject to a multiplicity of detailed regulatory requirements and public policies as well as to changes in training and purchasing priorities 
contracts with public sector customers may be conditioned upon the continuing availability of public funds  which in turn depends upon lengthy and complex budgetary procedures  and may be subject to certain pricing constraints 
moreover  us government contracts and those of many international government customers may generally be terminated for a variety of factors when it is in the best interests of the government and contractors may be suspended or debarred for misconduct at the discretion of the government 
there can be no assurance that these factors or others unique to government contracts or the loss or suspension of necessary regulatory licenses will not reduce our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
our us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 
the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract 
a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to re compete for future contracts and orders 
our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations  reduce the value of existing contracts  issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products  services and associated materials 
a negative audit by the us government could adversely affect our business  and we might not be reimbursed by the government for costs that we have expended on our contracts 
government agencies routinely audit government contracts 
these agencies review a contractor s performance on its contract  pricing practices  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if we are audited  we will not be reimbursed for any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract  while we would be required to refund any improper costs for which we had already been reimbursed 
therefore  an audit could result in a substantial adjustment to our revenues 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with united states government agencies 
we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
a governmental determination of impropriety or illegality  or an allegation of impropriety  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may be liable for penalties under a variety of procurement rules and regulations  and changes in government regulations could adversely impact our revenues  operating expenses and profitability 
our defense and commercial businesses must comply with and are affected by various government regulations that impact our operating costs  profit margins and our internal organization and operation of our businesses 
among the most significant regulations are the following o the us federal acquisition regulations  which regulate the formation  administration and performance of government contracts  o the us truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  and o the us cost accounting standards  which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost based government contracts 
these regulations affect how we and our customers do business and  in some instances  impose added costs on our businesses 
any changes in applicable laws could adversely affect the financial performance of the business affected by the changed regulations 
with respect to us government contracts  any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in contract termination  price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government 
our operating margins may decline under our fixed price contracts if we fail to estimate accurately the time and resources necessary to satisfy our obligations 
some of our contracts are fixed price contracts under which we bear the risk of any cost overruns 
our profits are adversely affected if our costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions that we used in bidding for the contract 
often  we are required to fix the price for a contract before we finalize the project specifications  which increases the risk that we will mis price these contracts 
the complexity of many of our engagements makes accurately estimating our time and resources more difficult 
if we are unable to retain our contracts with the us government and subcontracts under us government prime contracts in the competitive rebidding process  our revenues may suffer 
upon expiration of a us government contract or subcontract under a us government prime contract  if the government customer requires further services of the type provided in the contract  there is frequently a competitive rebidding process 
we cannot guarantee that we  or if we are a subcontractor that the prime contractor  will win any particular bid  or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract 
further  all us government contracts are subject to protest by competitors 
the termination of several of our significant contracts or nonrenewal of several of our significant contracts  could result in significant revenue shortfalls 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  us military business would have a material adverse effect on us 
us military contracts account for a significant portion of our business 
the us military funds these contracts in annual increments 
these contracts require subsequent authorization and appropriation that may not occur or that may be greater than or less than the total amount of the contract 
changes in the us military s budget  spending allocations and the timing of such spending could adversely affect our ability to receive future contracts 
none of our contracts with the us military has a minimum purchase commitment  and the us military generally has the right to cancel its contracts unilaterally without prior notice 
we manufacture for the us aircraft and land vehicle armor systems  protective equipment for military personnel and other technologies used to protect soldiers in a variety of life threatening or catastrophic situations  and batteries for communications devices 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  us military business for our aircraft and land vehicle armor systems  other protective equipment  or batteries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
a reduction of us force levels in iraq may affect our results of operations 
since the invasion of iraq by the us and other forces in march  we have received steadily increasing orders from the us military for armoring of vehicles and military batteries 
these orders are the result  in substantial part  from the particular combat situations encountered by the us military in iraq 
we cannot be certain  therefore  to what degree the us military would continue placing orders for our products if the us military were to reduce its force levels or withdraw completely from iraq 
a significant reduction in orders from the us military could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
there are limited sources for some of our raw materials  which may significantly curtail our manufacturing operations 
the raw materials that we use in manufacturing our armor products include kevlar r  a patented product of ei du pont de nemours co  inc we purchase kevlar in the form of woven cloth from various independent weaving companies 
in the event du pont and or these independent weaving companies were to cease  for any reason  to produce or sell kevlar to us  we might be unable to replace it with a material of like weight and strength  or at all 
thus  if our supply of kevlar were materially reduced or cut off or if there were a material increase in the price of kevlar  our manufacturing operations could be adversely affected and our costs increased  and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
some of the components of our products pose potential safety risks which could create potential liability exposure for us 
some of the components of our products contain elements that are known to pose potential safety risks 
in addition to these risks  there can be no assurance that accidents in our facilities will not occur 
any accident  whether occasioned by the use of all or any part of our products or technology or by our manufacturing operations  could adversely affect commercial acceptance of our products and could result in significant production delays or claims for damages resulting from injuries 
any of these occurrences would materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
in the event that our products  including the products manufactured by mdt and aoa  fail to perform as specified  users of these products may assert claims for substantial amounts 
these claims could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that the amount of the general product liability insurance that we maintain will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present amount of insurance can be maintained at the present level of cost  or at all 
our fields of business are highly competitive 
the competition to develop defense and security products and electric vehicle battery systems  and to obtain funding for the development of these products  is  and is expected to remain  intense 
our defense and security products compete with other manufacturers of specialized training systems  including firearms training systems  inc  a producer of interactive simulation systems designed to provide training in the handling and use of small and supporting arms 
in addition  we compete with manufacturers and developers of armor for cars and vans  including o gara hess eisenhardt  a division of armor holdings  inc our battery technology competes with other battery technologies  as well as other zinc air technologies 
the competition in this area of our business consists of development stage companies  major international companies and consortia of such companies  including battery manufacturers  automobile manufacturers  energy production and transportation companies  consumer goods companies and defense contractors 
various battery technologies are being considered for use in electric vehicles and defense and safety products by other manufacturers and developers  including the following lead acid  nickel cadmium  nickel iron  nickel zinc  nickel metal hydride  sodium sulfur  sodium nickel chloride  zinc bromine  lithium ion  lithium polymer  lithium iron sulfide  primary lithium  rechargeable alkaline and zinc air 
many of our competitors have financial  technical  marketing  sales  manufacturing  distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours 
if we are unable to compete successfully in each of our operating areas  especially in the defense and security products area of our business  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business is dependent on proprietary rights that may be difficult to protect and could affect our ability to compete effectively 
our ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and manufacturing processes through a combination of patent and trade secret protection  non disclosure agreements and licensing arrangements 
litigation  or participation in administrative proceedings  may be necessary to protect our proprietary rights 
this type of litigation can be costly and time consuming and could divert company resources and management attention to defend our rights  and this could harm us even if we were to be successful in the litigation 
in the absence of patent protection  and despite our reliance upon our proprietary confidential information  our competitors may be able to use innovations similar to those used by us to design and manufacture products directly competitive with our products 
in addition  no assurance can be given that others will not obtain patents that we will need to license or design around 
to the extent any of our products are covered by third party patents  we could need to acquire a license under such patents to develop and market our products 
despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  we may not be successful in doing so 
in addition  competition is intense  and there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in the event of patent litigation  we cannot assure you that a court would determine that we were the first creator of inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for those inventions 
if existing or future third party patents containing broad claims were upheld by the courts or if we were found to infringe third party patents  we may not be able to obtain the required licenses from the holders of such patents on acceptable terms  if at all 
failure to obtain these licenses could cause delays in the introduction of our products or necessitate costly attempts to design around such patents  or could foreclose the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in patent infringement suits brought by others and in prosecuting patent infringement suits against infringers 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  through non disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our customers  employees  consultants  and entities with which we maintain strategic relationships 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we are dependent on key personnel and our business would suffer if we fail to retain them 
we are highly dependent on the presidents of our ies  faac and aoa subsidiaries and the general managers of our mdt and epsilor subsidiaries  and the loss of the services of one or more of these persons could adversely affect us 
we are especially dependent on the services of our chairman  president and chief executive officer  robert s 
ehrlich 
the loss of mr 
ehrlich could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are party to an employment agreement with mr 
ehrlich  which agreement expires at the end of  and we may not be able to renew such contract on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we do not have key man life insurance on mr 
ehrlich 
there are risks involved with the international nature of our business 
a significant portion of our sales are made to customers located outside the us  primarily in europe and asia 
in  and  without taking account of revenues derived from discontinued operations   and  respectively  of our revenues  were derived from sales to customers located outside the us we expect that our international customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues in the near future 
sales to international customers may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency controls  exchange rate fluctuations  foreign taxes  longer payment cycles and changes in import export regulations and tariff rates 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation have been and in the future may be proposed in the us and certain other countries 
any resulting changes in current tariff structures or other trade and monetary policies could adversely affect our sales to international customers 
investors should not purchase our common stock with the expectation of receiving cash dividends 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  as a result  do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
market related risks the price of our common stock is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may change rapidly in the future 
the following factors  among others  may cause significant volatility in our stock price o announcements by us  our competitors or our customers  o the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by us or our competitors  o changes in the perceived ability to commercialize our technology compared to that of our competitors  o rumors relating to our competitors or us  o actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  o the issuance of our securities  including warrants  in connection with financings and acquisitions  and o general market or economic conditions 
if our shares were to be delisted  our stock price might decline further and we might be unable to raise additional capital 
one of the continued listing standards for our stock on the nasdaq national market is the maintenance of a bid price 
our stock price has traded below in the past 
if our bid price were to go and remain below for consecutive business days  nasdaq could notify us of our failure to meet the continued listing standards  after which we would have calendar days to correct such failure or be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
although we would have the opportunity to appeal any potential delisting  there can be no assurances that this appeal would be resolved favorably 
as a result  there can be no assurance that our common stock will remain listed on the nasdaq national market 
if our common stock were to be delisted from the nasdaq national market  we might apply to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  however  there can be no assurance that we would be approved for listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  which has the same minimum bid and other similar requirements as the nasdaq national market 
if we were to move to the nasdaq smallcap market  current nasdaq regulations would give us the opportunity to obtain an additional day grace period and an additional day grace period after that if we meet certain net income  stockholders equity or market capitalization criteria 
while our stock would continue to trade on the over the counter bulletin board following any delisting from the nasdaq  any such delisting of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of  and the efficiency of the trading market for  our common stock 
also  if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital  it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public equity markets 
in addition  if we fail to maintain nasdaq listing for our securities  and no other exclusion from the definition of a penny stock under the securities exchange act of  as amended  is available  then any broker engaging in a transaction in our securities would be required to provide any customer with a risk disclosure document  disclosure of market quotations  if any  disclosure of the compensation of the broker dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market values of our securities held in the customer s account 
the bid and offer quotation and compensation information must be provided prior to effecting the transaction and must be contained on the customer s confirmation 
if brokers become subject to the penny stock rules when engaging in transactions in our securities  they would become less willing to engage in transactions  thereby making it more difficult for our stockholders to dispose of their shares 
we expect our auditors to report a material weakness in our internal controls 
if we fail to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  beginning with this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending december   we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting 
pursuant to securities and exchange commission release no 
 which  subject to certain conditions  provides up to additional days beyond the due date of this form k for the filing of management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting required by item a of regulation s k  and the related attestation report of the independent registered public accounting firm  as required by item b of regulation s k  management s report on internal control over financial reporting and the associated report on the audit of management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december   are not filed herein and are expected to be filed no later than may  the internal control report must contain i a statement of management s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  ii a statement identifying the framework used by management to conduct the required evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  iii management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our most recent fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not internal control over financial reporting is effective  and iv a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
we expect that our auditors will inform us  although they have not yet done so  that they identified significant deficiencies that constitute a material weakness under standards established by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa 
a material weakness is a condition in which the design or operation of one or more of the internal control components does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that misstatements caused by error or fraud in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial statements being audited may occur and not be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions 
we expect that our auditors will report to us that at december   we had a significant deficiency in our financial statement closing process and related processes because the size our accounting and finance department and the press of work related to our recent acquisitions caused us to be unable independently to comply with the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles related to highly complex financial transactions applicable to equity issuances and business combinations 
as a public company  we will have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls 
the process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company 
we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken or will take to remediate any material weaknesses or that we will implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future as we continue our rapid growth 
if we are unable to establish appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures  it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations  result in material misstatements in our financial statements  harm our operating results  cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our common stock 
a substantial number of our shares are available for sale in the public market and sales of those shares could adversely affect our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market  or the perception that those sales could occur  could adversely affect our stock price or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities 
as of february   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
of these shares  most are freely transferable without restriction under the securities act of  and a substantial portion of the remaining shares may be sold subject to the volume restrictions  manner of sale provisions and other conditions of rule under the securities act of exercise of our warrants  options and convertible debt could adversely affect our stock price and will be dilutive 
as of february   there were outstanding warrants to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  of which  were vested  at a weighted average exercise price of per share  and outstanding debentures convertible into a total of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average conversion price of per share 
holders of our options  warrants and convertible debt will probably exercise or convert them only at a time when the price of our common stock is higher than their respective exercise or conversion prices 
accordingly  we may be required to issue shares of our common stock at a price substantially lower than the market price of our stock 
this could adversely affect our stock price 
in addition  if and when these shares are issued  the percentage of our common stock that existing stockholders own will be diluted 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions o divide our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms  o only permit removal of directors by stockholders for cause  and require the affirmative vote of at least of the outstanding common stock to so remove  and o allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders 
the classification system of electing directors and the removal provision may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us and may maintain the incumbency of our board of directors  as the classification of the board of directors increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of the directors 
these provisions may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers  delaying changes in our control or management  or may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions 
the amendment of any of these provisions would require approval by holders of at least of the outstanding common stock 
israel related risks a significant portion of our operations takes place in israel  and we could be adversely affected by the economic  political and military conditions in that region 
the offices and facilities of three of our subsidiaries  efl  mdt and epsilor  are located in israel in beit shemesh  lod and dimona  respectively  all of which are within israel s pre borders 
most of our senior management is located at efl s facilities 
although we expect that most of our sales will be made to customers outside israel  we are nonetheless directly affected by economic  political and military conditions in that country 
accordingly  any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
historically  arab states have boycotted any direct trade with israel and to varying degrees have imposed a secondary boycott on any company carrying on trade with or doing business in israel 
although in october  the states comprising the gulf cooperation council saudi arabia  the united arab emirates  kuwait  dubai  bahrain and oman announced that they would no longer adhere to the secondary boycott against israel  and israel has entered into certain agreements with egypt  jordan  the palestine liberation organization and the palestinian authority  israel has not entered into any peace arrangement with syria or lebanon 
moreover  since september  there has been a significant deterioration in israel s relationship with the palestinian authority  and a significant increase in terror and violence 
efforts to resolve the problem have failed to result in an agreeable solution 
continued hostilities between the palestinian community and israel and any failure to settle the conflict may have a material adverse effect on our business and us 
moreover  the current political and security situation in the region has already had an adverse effect on the economy of israel  which in turn may have an adverse effect on us 
service of process and enforcement of civil liabilities on us and our officers may be difficult to obtain 
we are organized under the laws of the state of delaware and will be subject to service of process in the united states 
however  approximately of our assets are located outside the united states 
in addition  two of our directors and most of our executive officers are residents of israel and a portion of the assets of such directors and executive officers are located outside the united states 
there is doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended  in original actions instituted in israel 
as a result  it may not be possible for investors to enforce or effect service of process upon these directors and executive officers or to judgments of us courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of us laws against our assets  as well as the assets of these directors and executive officers 
in addition  awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the us or elsewhere may be unenforceable in israel 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the israeli nis may negatively affect our earnings 
although a substantial majority of our revenues and a substantial portion of our expenses are denominated in us dollars  a portion of our costs  including personnel and facilities related expenses  is incurred in new israeli shekels nis 
inflation in israel will have the effect of increasing the dollar cost of our operations in israel  unless it is offset on a timely basis by a devaluation of the nis relative to the dollar 
in  the inflation adjusted nis appreciated against the dollar  which raised the dollar cost of our israeli operations 
some of our agreements are governed by israeli law 
israeli law governs some of our agreements  such as our lease agreements on our subsidiaries premises in israel  and the agreements pursuant to which we purchased ies  mdt and epsilor 
while israeli law differs in certain respects from american law  we do not believe that these differences materially adversely affect our rights or remedies under these agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk it is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments  except for hedging of foreign currency exposures 
we do not currently have any significant interest rate exposure 
foreign currency exchange rate risk since a significant part of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  we have experienced only insignificant foreign exchange gains and losses to date  and do not expect to incur significant foreign exchange gains and losses in our research  development and production activities are primarily carried out by our israeli subsidiary  efl  at its facility in beit shemesh  and accordingly we have sales and expenses in new israeli shekels 
additionally  our mdt and epsilor subsidiaries operate primarily in new israeli shekels 
however  the majority of our sales are made outside israel in us dollars  and a substantial portion of our costs are incurred in us dollars 
therefore  our functional currency is the us dollar 
please see impact of inflation and currency fluctuations  above and note b to the notes to the consolidated financial statements
