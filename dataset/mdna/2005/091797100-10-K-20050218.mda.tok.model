item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the corporation is a global manufacturer and marketer of power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement products  and technology based fastening systems 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation operates in three reportable business segments power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement  and fastening and assembly systems with these business segments comprising  and  respectively  of the corporation s sales in the percentage of the corporation s total sales contributed by its power tools and accessories segment will increase in when a full year s sales of the porter cable and delta tools group  acquired on october   are included in that segment s results 
the porter cable and delta tools group includes the porter cable  delta  devilbiss air power company  oldham saw  and flex businesses 
the corporation markets its products and services in over countries 
during  approximately   and of its sales were made to customers in the united states  in europe including the united kingdom  and in other geographic regions  respectively 
the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments are subject to general economic conditions in the countries in which they operate as well as the strength of the retail economies 
the fastening and assembly systems segment is also subject to general economic conditions in the countries in which it operates as well as to automotive and industrial demand 
the corporation reported net earnings of million  or per share  on a diluted basis  for the year ended december   compared to net earnings of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report  net earnings for the year ended december   included a million net gain on the sale of discontinued operations 
the corporation reported net earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december   as compared to net earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december   included a pre tax restructuring charge of million million net of tax 
that million pre tax restructuring charge was net of million  representing reversals of previously provided restructuring reserves as well as the excess of proceeds received on the sale of long lived assets  written down as part of restructuring actions  over their adjusted carrying values 
the increase in the corporation s net earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations for  as compared to  is partially attributable to restructuring and exit costs recognized in total consolidated sales of billion for the year ended december   increased by over the prior year s level 
of that increase  was attributable to an increase in unit volume of existing businesses  was attributable to sales of acquired businesses  and was attributable to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  offset by attributable to the negative effect of pricing actions 
in this management s discussion and analysis  the corporation has attempted to differentiate between sales of its existing or legacy businesses and sales of acquired businesses 
that differentiation includes sales of businesses where year to year comparability exists in the category of existing or legacy businesses 
for example  in  the sales of both the porter cable and delta tools group business and the masterfix business each acquired in are included in sales of acquired businesses 
in addition  sales of the baldwin and weiser businesses  acquired in the fourth quarter of  are included in acquired businesses for the first nine months of but in existing or legacy businesses for the final three months of operating income for the year ended december   increased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  in that million of operating income for the year ended december   was reduced by million of restructuring and exit costs 
the increase in operating income as a percentage of sales during the year ended december   primarily resulted from improved gross margins  the leverage of fixed costs over a higher sales base  and the absence of charges for restructuring and exit costs 
the improvements in gross margin in were attributable to the positive effects of restructuring and other productivity initiatives as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by the negative effects of pricing actions and higher raw material costs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased in dollar terms over the prior year s level  principally due to incremental expenses of the businesses acquired in the past year and the effects of foreign currency translation 
during  the corporation also recognized increased promotional and marketing expenses as well as higher expenses associated with stock based compensation and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined from in to in principally due to the impact of the porter cable and delta tools group acquisition 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december   increased by million over the level to million 
in addition to the improvements in operating income described above  pre tax earnings from continuing operations during benefited from a million reduction in interest expense net of interest income from the level 
as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report  on october   the corporation acquired the porter cable and delta tools group from pentair  inc for a purchase price of approximately million net of cash acquired of million and including transaction costs of million 
that cash purchase price of million included a payment of million  on a preliminary basis  based upon the estimated increase in the net assets of the porter cable and delta tools group 
the final purchase price is subject to customary adjustments based upon changes in the net assets of the tools group through the closing date 
the tools group business has been included in the corporation s power tools and accessories segment 
the corporation believes that its acquisition of the tools group was both strategically and financially compelling 
the acquisition of the tools group has added well respected brands to the corporation s portfolio and expanded the offerings in product lines where the corporation had relatively low market share  including woodworking equipment  compressors  pressure washers  and nailers 
in addition  the acquisition of the tools group provided the corporation with the opportunity to achieve cost synergies as it integrates the acquired businesses into its existing professional power tools business 
in the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that follows  the corporation generally attempts to list contributing factors in order of significance to the point being addressed 
sales the following chart provides an analysis of the consolidated changes in sales for the years ended december    and year ended december  dollars in millions total sales    unit volume existing a unit volume acquired b price currency change in total sales a represents change in unit volume for businesses where year to year comparability exists 
b represents change in unit volume for businesses that were acquired and were not included in prior period results 
total consolidated sales for the year ended december   were  million  which represented a increase over sales of  million 
excluding the incremental effects of the masterfix and porter cable and delta tools group businesses acquired in  and of the baldwin and weiser businesses for the first nine months of  total unit volume increased by during the year ended december  the improvement was primarily attributable to the corporation s north american businesses 
as compared to the corresponding period in  a double digit increase in sales volume was experienced by the corporation s legacy professional power tools and accessories business as well as its plumbing products business in north america 
unit volume of acquired businesses contributed to the sales growth for over the levels 
pricing actions had a negative effect on sales for  as compared to in addition to pricing actions taken in response to competitive conditions  the impact of pricing in non us markets during as a result of the favorable currency effects of us dollar sourced products also negatively impacted the comparison to the effects of a weaker us dollar compared to other currencies  particularly the euro  and to a lesser degree  the pound sterling  caused a increase in the corporation s consolidated sales during  as compared to total consolidated sales for the year ended december   were  million  which represented a increase over sales of  million 
excluding the incremental effects of the baldwin and weiser businesses  acquired in october  total unit volume increased by during the year ended december  unit volume of the acquired baldwin and weiser businesses contributed to the sales growth for over the level 
the remainder of the increase in unit volume was due to higher sales of the power tools and accessories and security hardware businesses  particularly in north america  partially offset by a unit volume decline in the plumbing products business 
pricing actions  taken in response to customer and competitive pressures  had a negative effect on sales for as compared to the effects of a weaker us dollar compared to other currencies  particularly the euro and  to a lesser degree  the pound sterling and canadian dollar  caused a increase in the corporation s consolidated sales during over the prior year s level 
these positive effects were partially offset by the devaluation of several latin american currencies during as compared to earnings the corporation reported consolidated operating income of million on sales of  million in  compared to operating income of million on sales of  million in and to operating income of million on sales of  million in consolidated operating income for and included pre tax restructuring charges of million and million  respectively 
those and pre tax charges were net of reversals of million and million  respectively  representing reversals of previously provided restructuring reserves as well as the excess of proceeds received on the sale of long lived assets  written down as part of restructuring actions  over their adjusted carrying values 
consolidated gross margin as a percentage of sales for was compared to for the increase in gross margin in was attributable to the positive effects of restructuring and other productivity initiatives  the leverage of fixed costs over a higher sales base and  in europe  favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
these positive factors were partially offset by the negative effect of pricing actions taken by the corporation as previously described  by higher raw material and pension costs  and by lower gross margins of the acquired porter cable and delta tools group 
consolidated gross margin as a percentage of sales for was as compared to for the increase in gross margin in was attributable to several positive factors that included i the positive effect of restructuring initiatives  ii higher productivity  including six sigma productivity initiatives  and iii favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
these positive factors were partially offset by pricing actions taken by the corporation in response to customer and competitive pressures and by lower production levels in as compared to consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in  compared to in and in selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million in  over the level 
the incremental expenses of the acquired businesses and the effects of foreign currency translation accounted for approximately and of that increase  respectively 
higher promotional  marketing  and research and development expenses  particularly in the north american power tools and accessories business  higher transportation and distribution expenses to support the increased sales level  and higher corporate expenses driven by expenses related to stock based compensation and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act accounted for much of the remaining increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses during consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million in over the level 
the effects of foreign currency translation and acquired businesses accounted for million and million of the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses  respectively 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from to was primarily a result of higher marketing and promotional expenses  which were partially offset by lower selling  general  and administrative expenses  including expenses associated with legal and environmental matters 
consolidated net interest expense interest expense less interest income was million in  compared to million in and million in the lower net interest expense in  as compared to  was primarily the result of higher interest income associated with the corporation s foreign cash investment activities in  coupled with lower borrowing levels 
the lower net interest expense in  as compared to  resulted from both lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates 
other expense was million in compared to million in and million in consolidated income tax expense of million  million  and million was recognized on the corporation s earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of million  million  and million  for  and  respectively 
the corporation s effective tax rate was for  compared to an effective tax rate of for and for for  tax benefits of million were recognized on pre tax restructuring and exit costs of million  as compared to a million benefit on pre tax restructuring and exit costs of million in the corresponding period 
the lower effective tax rate during reflects the higher tax benefit associated with the restructuring charge 
a further analysis of taxes on earnings is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation reported net earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december   compared to net earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share on a diluted basis for the year ended december   and million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  the corporation reported net earnings from discontinued operations of million in  as compared to million in and million in as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report  net earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended december   included a million gain on sale of discontinued operations 
the million gain recognized during consisted of a million gain on the sale of two discontinued businesses nemef and corbin in early  partially offset by a million goodwill impairment charge associated with the remaining discontinued business dom 
during  the discontinued dom business was under contract for sale at million  pending regulatory approval 
the corporation terminated that contract in january when regulatory approval was not obtained and is currently marketing the dom business for sale 
the corporation reported net earnings of million  million  and million  or   and per share on a diluted basis  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in addition to the impact of operational matters  earnings per share for also benefited from lower shares outstanding than those outstanding in and business segments as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation operates in three reportable business segments power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement  and fastening and assembly systems 
power tools and accessories segment sales and profit for the power tools and accessories segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers    segment profit sales to unaffiliated customers in the power tools and accessories segment during increased over the level 
sales of the porter cable and delta tools group businesses acquired early in the fourth quarter of  accounted for percentage points of the increase in  while sales of the legacy power tools and accessories businesses accounted for the remaining percentage points of growth 
sales in north america increased at a double digit rate during over the prior year s level 
approximately half of this increase was due to the incremental sales of the acquired porter cable and delta tools group businesses 
sales of the corporation s legacy professional power tools and accessories business in north america increased at a double digit rate as sales grew in all major channels and product lines 
sales of the corporation s consumer power tools and accessories business grew at a mid single digit rate during  compared to  as increased sales of consumer power tools and outdoor products were partially offset by lower sales of accessories and cleaning and lighting products 
sales in europe during increased at a low single digit rate due to the incremental sales of flex  a component of the acquired porter cable and delta tools group business  and a high single digit rate of increase in sales of the corporation s legacy european professional power tools and accessories business 
these increases were partially offset by a low single digit rate of decrease in sales of consumer power tools and accessories  largely as a result of lower sales of outdoor products 
sales in other geographic areas increased at a double digit rate during over the levels 
sales of the corporation s legacy power tools and accessories businesses in other geographic areas during increased at a high single digit rate over the prior year s level as sales increased at a high single digit rate in central and south america and at a double digit rate in asia 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the power tools and accessories segment improved from in to in that improvement resulted from an increase in gross margin and a reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses  both as a percentage of sales 
improvements in gross margin as a percentage of sales were due to the positive effects of restructuring and other productivity initiatives  favorable product mix  and foreign currency effects  partially offset by the negative effects of pricing actions and  to a lesser extent  rising raw material costs 
while the impact of rising material costs was mitigated in by fixed price supply agreements  the business anticipates additional cost pressures in as those supply agreements are renegotiated 
the reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was principally due to the impact of the porter cable and delta tools group acquisition 
the acquisition of the lower margin porter cable and delta tools group early in the fourth quarter of had a basis point negative impact on segment profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december   and is expected to continue to depress segment profit as a percentage of sales in sales to unaffiliated customers in the power tools and accessories segment during decreased from the level 
in north america  sales of power tools and accessories during decreased at a low single digit rate from the level due predominantly to a low single digit decrease in sales of the consumer power tools and accessories business 
strength in the north american professional power tools and accessories business in the second half of the year nearly offset declines during the first sixth months of sales of the consumer power tools and accessories business decreased at a low single digit rate from the level  as a double digit rate of growth in sales of outdoor products was more than offset by a double digit rate of decline in sales of home products and a low single digit rate of decrease of sales of power tools and accessories as unfavorable price more than offset increased volume 
both the professional and consumer power tools and accessories businesses were negatively affected by customers actions to manage inventory levels during sales of power tools and accessories in europe during decreased at a mid single digit rate from the level  as sales of professional power tools and accessories decreased at a low single digit rate and sales of consumer power tools and accessories declined at a mid single digit rate 
sales were down across europe and in most product lines as weak economic conditions persisted during sales in other geographic areas increased at a high single digit rate in over the level  as higher sales were achieved in professional power tools and accessories  consumer power tools and accessories  and home products 
increases in sales occurred throughout south and central america  asia  and australia 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the power tools and accessories segment was for as compared to for gross margin as a percentage of sales improved slightly as the positive effects of productivity initiatives  restructuring actions  and foreign currency rates were offset by the negative effects of pricing actions  promotional activities  and lower production levels 
during  the power tools and accessories segment reduced its production levels by approximately from the levels 
that reduction in production levels was primarily attributable to the efforts by the business to reduce its inventory levels 
as of december   the power tools and accessories segment decreased its total inventories  excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  by approximately from year end levels 
that decrease was in comparison to an approximate increase in total inventories  excluding the effects of foreign currency translation at december   over the year end levels 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly during as compared to as promotional and marketing expenses increased 
hardware and home improvement segment sales and profit for the hardware and home improvement segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers segment profit sales to unaffiliated customers in the hardware and home improvement segment increased during over the level 
during  the impact of the baldwin and weiser acquisition accounted for percentage points of the increase  while higher sales of the price pfister and kwikset businesses  coupled with sales growth in the baldwin and weiser businesses after the anniversary of the acquisition  accounted for the remaining percentage points 
sales of plumbing products increased at a double digit rate during  reflecting the expansion of listings at a key retailer that occurred during the third quarter of as well as higher sales at other retailers 
sales of kwikset security hardware products increased over the level at a mid single digit rate due to strong retail sales 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the hardware and home improvement segment rose to for from for segment profit as a percentage of sales for benefited from significant gross margin improvement 
that gross margin improvement was primarily driven by volume leverage and productivity improvements  partially offset by the impact of higher raw material costs as well as costs associated with manufacturing rationalization in the security hardware business 
the acquisition of baldwin and weiser did not have a significant effect on segment profit as a percentage of sales during sales to unaffiliated customers in the hardware and home improvement segment in increased over the level 
this increase in sales was almost entirely due to the acquisition of baldwin and weiser early in the fourth quarter of a low single digit rate of increase in sales of the kwikset security hardware business in north america was partially offset by a low single digit rate of decrease in sales of plumbing products 
as a result of a line review in  the corporation s plumbing products business lost significant shelf space at the home depot stores in the central and eastern united states 
that loss of shelf space at the home depot negatively impacted plumbing product sales in by approximately million  but was partially offset in by an expansion of listings at lowe s home improvement warehouse during the second quarter of segment profit as a percentage of sales for the hardware and home improvement segment was for compared to for  mainly driven by improvements in gross margin as a percentage of sales 
productivity improvements and the results of restructuring actions were the primary factors that contributed to the increase in segment profit as a percentage of sales 
the increase in segment profit as a percentage of sales due to gross margin improvements was slightly offset by a one percentage point increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in as compared to the level due to higher sales related expenses  including promotion  marketing  and salesmen s compensation 
the acquisition of baldwin and weiser did not have a significant effect on segment profit during fastening and assembly systems segment sales and profit for the fastening and assembly systems segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers segment profit sales to unaffiliated customers in the fastening and assembly systems segment increased by in over the level 
during march  the corporation completed the acquisition of masterfix  an industrial fastening company with operations in europe and asia

sales in europe during increased over the level at a double digit rate  due largely to the incremental sales of the masterfix business 
the fastening and assembly system segment s legacy european industrial business experienced a mid single digit rate of growth during as compared to  while sales in its legacy european automotive business approximated the level 
sales in the segment s legacy businesses in asia increased at a double digit rate in  as compared to segment profit as a percentage of sales for the fastening and assembly systems segment declined from in to in  primarily due to significant costs increases in steel and other raw materials 
the incremental impact of the masterfix business did not have a significant effect on segment profit as a percentage of sales of the fastening and assembly systems segment during sales to unaffiliated customers in the fastening and assembly systems segment during increased slightly over the level as a mid single digit rate of increase in sales in europe and asia was substantially offset by a mid single digit rate decrease in sales in north america 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the fastening and assembly systems segment was for as compared to during that decline was due to lower production volumes  resulting from weak industrial demand and lower automotive production that were substantially offset by productivity improvements 
other segment related matters as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in determining segment profit  expenses relating to pension and other postretirement benefits are based solely upon estimated service costs 
also  as more fully described in item under the caption financial condition  expense recognized by the corporation in relating to its pension and other postretirement benefits plans increased by approximately million over the level 
the adjustment to businesses postretirement benefit expense booked in consolidation as identified in the second table included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements was income of

in  the corporation recognized million of pre tax restructuring and exit costs related to actions taken in its power tools and accessories segment 
the restructuring actions taken in principally reflect severance benefits 
the million charge recognized during was offset  however  by the reversal of million of severance accruals established as part of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required and million representing the excess of proceeds received on the sale of long lived assets  written down as part of restructuring actions  over their adjusted carrying values 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation formulated a restructuring plan designed to reduce its manufacturing footprint  variable production costs  and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the corporation initially anticipated that the cost of the total restructuring plan expected to be completed over a two to three year period would be million 
the million charge recognized by the corporation during represented the final pre tax charge associated with this restructuring plan 
that amount  coupled with restructuring charges recognized in connection with this plan in and  brought the total pre tax restructuring charge under this plan to million 
that million charge includes million relating to the corporation s european security hardware business that is reflected as discontinued operations 
the following discussion excludes the restructuring actions relating to the european security hardware business 
earnings from discontinued operations include pre tax restructuring reversals charges of 
million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  the corporation commenced the final phase of its restructuring plan and recorded a pre tax restructuring charge associated with that plan of million 
that million charge was net of million of reversals of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required and million  representing the excess of proceeds received on the sale of long lived assets  written down as part of restructuring actions  over their adjusted carrying values 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of the corporation recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in its hardware and home improvement segment as a result of the acquisition of baldwin and weiser 
the million pre tax restructuring charge recognized in principally reflects actions relating to the power tools and accessories segment to reduce its manufacturing cost base as well as actions to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses through the elimination of administrative positions 
actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in the power tools and accessories segment include the closure of one facility in the united states and the transfer of certain additional power tool production from a facility in the united states to a low cost facility in mexico 
the restructuring charge provided for actions to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses  principally in europe  and to a lesser extent in the united states  principally reducing headcount

the restructuring charge also includes pension curtailment losses stemming from headcount reductions associated with the restructuring actions 
as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the severance benefits accrual  included in the million and million pre tax restructuring charges taken in and  respectively  related to the elimination of approximately  positions in high cost manufacturing locations and in certain administrative positions 
the corporation estimates that  as a result of increases in manufacturing employee headcount in low cost locations  approximately  replacement positions will be filled  yielding a net total of positions eliminated as a result of the and restructuring actions 
the corporation anticipates that the execution of the restructuring actions associated with the restructuring plan that was formulated by the corporation in the fourth quarter of will be completed during the corporation anticipates that the closure of the manufacturing facility in its hardware and home improvement segment as a result of the acquisition of baldwin and weiser will be completed during given the nature and duration of this restructuring plan  the timing of the actions is subject to varying degrees of estimation associated with key assumptions  such as actual timing of execution  general economic conditions  and other variables 
in addition to the recognition of restructuring and exit costs  the corporation also recognizes related expenses  incremental to the cost of the underlying restructuring actions  that do not qualify as restructuring or exit costs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states restructuring related expenses 
those restructuring related expenses include items directly related to the underlying restructuring actions that benefit ongoing operations  such as costs associated with the transfer of equipment 
operating results for the year ended december  and  included approximately million and million  respectively  of restructuring related expenses

the corporation expects that those incremental pre tax savings in will benefit cost of goods sold and selling  general  and administrative expenses in approximately the same ratio as experienced in the corporation expects that pre tax savings associated with the restructuring actions related to the integration of baldwin and weiser into its existing security hardware business will benefit and results by approximately million  respectively  net of restructuring related expenses  resulting in annual savings of approximately million 
the restructuring related expense associated with these integration plans had an adverse pre tax impact of approximately million in ultimate savings realized from restructuring actions may be mitigated by such factors as economic weakness and competitive pressures  as well as decisions to increase costs in areas such as promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed 
as previously indicated  the pre tax restructuring charges recognized in   and of  million  and million  respectively  were net of reversals in   and of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required and proceeds received in excess of the adjusted carrying value of long lived assets in the aggregate of million  million  and million  respectively 
adjustments to the severance component of restructuring reserves previously established related to i actual attrition factors that differed from those initially estimated  ii more cost effective methods of severing employment that became probable  typically based on negotiations with trade unions or local government institutions  and iii amendments to the initial plan that were approved by the appropriate level of management  based primarily on changes in market conditions that dictated a modification to the intended course of action 
during   and  none of the adjustments to the severance obligations recorded in connection with restructuring actions was individually significant 
adjustments to the asset write down component of restructuring reserves previously established related to the receipt of proceeds in excess of adjusted carrying values of fixed assets that were disposed of in connection with the restructuring actions 
adjustments to the other charge component of restructuring reserves previously established principally related to settlement of operating lease commitments at amounts less than initially estimated or the corporation s ability to sublease certain facilities exited as part of the restructuring actions 
asset write downs taken as part of the and restructuring charge included land  buildings  and manufacturing equipment 
the carrying values of land and buildings to be sold were written down to their estimated fair values  generally based upon third party offers  less disposal costs 
the carrying values of manufacturing equipment and furniture and fixtures were written down to their fair value based upon estimated salvage values  which generally were negligible  less disposal cost 
in addition to the previously discussed restructuring actions  prior to the date of the acquisition of baldwin and weiser and during the fourth quarter of  the corporation identified opportunities to restructure these businesses as well as to integrate these businesses into the existing security hardware business included in the corporation s hardware and home improvement segment 
subsequent to the acquisition  the corporation approved restructuring actions relating to the acquired businesses of million 
these actions principally reflect severance benefits associated with administrative and manufacturing actions related to the acquired businesses  including the closure of an acquired administration and distribution facility 
the corporation anticipates that these restructuring actions will be completed in also  prior to the date of the acquisition of the porter cable and delta tools group and during the fourth quarter of  the corporation identified opportunities to restructure these businesses as well as to integrate these businesses into its existing power tools and accessories segment 
subsequent to the acquisition  the corporation approved restructuring actions relating to the acquired business of million 
these actions principally reflect severance costs associated with administrative and manufacturing actions related to the acquired businesses  including the closure of two manufacturing facilities  and lease and other contractual obligations for which no future benefit will be realized 
certain of these restructuring actions commenced in with the remainder commencing in early the corporation expects that these restructuring actions will be completed by the end of the corporation continues its evaluation of the identified opportunities to restructure these businesses as well as to integrate these businesses into its existing power tools and accessories segment 
the corporation anticipates that finalization of its planned integration actions will not occur until hedging activities the corporation has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than countries 
as a result  it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures 
the major foreign currencies in which foreign currency risks exist are the euro  pound sterling  canadian dollar  japanese yen  chinese renminbi  australian dollar  mexican peso  czech koruna  and brazilian real 
through its foreign currency activities  the corporation seeks to reduce the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of products manufactured in a currency different from that of the selling subsidiary will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
on january   the twelve participating member countries of the european monetary union canceled their respective legacy currencies which were replaced by the euro as legal tender 
the corporation believes that the introduction of the euro has resulted in increased competitive pressures in continental europe due to the heightened transparency of intra european pricing structures 
from time to time  currency devaluations may occur in countries in which the corporation sells or manufactures its product 
while the corporation will take actions to mitigate the impacts of any future currency devaluations  there is no assurance that such devaluations will not adversely affect the corporation 
assets and liabilities of subsidiaries located outside of the united states are translated at rates of exchange at the balance sheet date as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
during  translation adjustments  recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity  increased stockholders equity by million compared to an increase of million in as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation seeks to issue debt opportunistically  whether at fixed or variable rates  at the lowest possible costs 
based upon its assessment of the future interest rate environment and its desired variable rate debt to total debt ratio  the corporation may elect to manage its interest rate risk associated with changes in the fair value of its indebtedness  or the cash flows of its indebtedness  through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
in order to meet its goal of fixing or limiting interest costs  the corporation maintains a portfolio of interest rate hedge instruments 
the variable rate debt to total debt ratio  after taking interest rate hedges into account  was at december   compared to at december   and at december  at december   average debt maturity was years compared to years at december   and years at december  interest rate sensitivity the following table provides information as of december   about the corporation s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the interest rate swaps 
weighted average variable rates are generally based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of the reset dates 
the cash flows of these instruments are denominated in a variety of currencies 
unless otherwise indicated  the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the corporation s reporting currency  as of december  principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity dates fair value assets us dollars in millions thereafter total liabilities liabilities short term borrowings variable rate other currencies average interest rate long term debt fixed rate us dollars 


  average interest rate other current liabilities fixed rate us dollars average interest rate interest rate derivatives fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps us dollars average pay rate a average receive rate a the average pay rate is based upon month forward libor  except for million in notional principal amount which matures in and thereafter and is based upon month forward libor 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity as discussed above  the corporation is exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   the corporation has hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward exchange contracts 
the corporation estimated the effect on gross profits  based upon a recent estimate of foreign exchange exposures  of a uniform strengthening in the value of the united states dollar 
the corporation estimated that this would have the effects of reducing gross profits for by approximately million 
the corporation also estimated the effects on gross profits  based upon a recent estimate of foreign exchange exposures  of a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar 
a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar would have the effect of increasing gross profits 
in addition to their direct effects  changes in exchange rates also affect sales volumes and foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates previously described does not reflect a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices nor does it reflect higher exchange rates  compared to those experienced during  inherent in the foreign exchange hedging portfolio at december  critical accounting policies the corporation s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the corporation believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation  or complexity than other accounting policies 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation performs goodwill impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the corporation cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled  million at december  such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the corporation s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 
pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  rates of salary increase  health care cost trend rates  mortality rates  and other factors 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis prior to the beginning of each year 
the corporation considers current market conditions  including interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the corporation develops the discount rates by considering the yields available on high quality fixed income investments with long term maturities corresponding to the related benefit obligation 
the corporation s discount rate for united states defined benefit pension plans was at december  and as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation develops the expected return on plan assets by considering various factors  which include its targeted asset allocation percentages  historic returns  and expected future returns 
the corporation s expected long term rate of return assumption for united states defined benefit plans was in and the corporation believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  however  differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the corporation s financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of a specified corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and a calculated value of assets referred to as the market related value of assets 
the corporation s aggregate market related value of assets exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million as of the measurement date 
differences between assumed and actual returns are amortized to the market related value on a straight line basis over a five year period 
also  gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and from differences between assumptions and actual experience except those differences being amortized to the market related value of assets are amortized over the expected remaining service period of active plan participants or  for retired participants  the average remaining life expectancy  to the extent that such amounts exceed ten percent of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year 
the corporation expects that its pension and other postretirement benefit costs in will exceed the costs recognized in by approximately million 
this increase is principally attributable to two factors a reduction in the market related value of pension plan assets  as compared to the prior year  and the effect of amortization of certain actuarial losses 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation recognized pre tax restructuring charges of  million  and million during   and  respectively 
those pre tax restructuring charges in   and were net of reversals of previously established pre tax restructuring reserves and proceeds received in excess of the adjusted carrying value of long lived assets in the aggregate of million  million  and million  respectively 
the related restructuring reserves reflect estimates  including those pertaining to separation costs  settlements of contractual obligations  and asset valuations 
the corporation reassesses the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan within the restructuring program at the end of each reporting period 
actual experience has been and may continue to be different from the estimates used to establish the restructuring reserves 
at december   the corporation had liabilities established in conjunction with its restructuring activities that totaled million 
as more fully described in item of this report  the corporation is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including those with respect to environmental matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
the corporation evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome  the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss  and in certain instances  the ability of other parties to share costs 
also  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states when a range of probable loss exists  the corporation accrues at the low end of the range when no other more likely amount exists 
unanticipated events or changes in these factors may require the corporation to increase the amount it has accrued for any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously accrued because it was not probable 
further  as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  insurance recoveries for environmental and certain general liability claims have not been recognized until realized 
any insurance recoveries  if realized in future periods  could have a favorable impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations in the periods realized 
the corporation is also subject to income tax laws in many countries 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the corporation s financial statements or tax returns 
additionally  the corporation is subject to periodic examinations by taxing authorities in many countries 
the final outcome of these future tax consequences  tax audits  and changes in regulatory tax laws and rates could materially impact the corporation s financial statements 
during  the corporation received notices of proposed adjustments from the united states internal revenue service irs in connection with audits of the tax years through the principal adjustment proposed by the irs consists of the disallowance of a capital loss deduction taken in the corporation s tax returns and interest on the deficiency 
prior to receiving the notices of proposed adjustments from the irs  the corporation filed a petition against the irs in the federal district court of maryland the court seeking refunds for a carryback of a portion of the aforementioned capital loss deduction 
the irs subsequently filed a counterclaim to the corporation s petition 
in october  the court granted the corporation s motion for summary judgement on its complaint against the irs and dismissed the irs counterclaim 
in its opinion  the court ruled in the corporation s favor that the capital losses cannot be disallowed by the irs 
in december  the irs appealed the court s decision in favor of the corporation to the united states circuit court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
that appeal is still pending 
the corporation intends to vigorously dispute the position taken by the irs in this matter 
the corporation has provided adequate reserves in the event that the irs prevails in its disallowance of the previously described capital loss and the impostion of related interest 
should the irs prevail in its disallowance of the capital loss deduction and the imposition of related interest  it would result in a cash outflow of approximately million 
if upheld  the court s decision would result in the corporation receiving a refund of taxes previously paid of approximately million  plus interest 
the corporation believes that any such outflow or inflow is unlikely to occur until or later 
impact of new accounting standards as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation has not yet adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payments  or no 
 inventory costs 
financial condition operating activities generated cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million of cash generated for the year ended december  cash flow from operating activities included cash flow from discontinued operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in over was primarily the result of increased earnings from continuing operations and increased cash provided by other assets and liabilities which was partially offset by lower cash from working capital 
increases in inventories associated with the higher level of sales and to achieve higher service levels and decreases in accounts payable associated with the timing of production and payments exceeded the increase in accrued liabilities associated with higher sales and earnings levels in as compared to the increase in over in cash provided by operating activities associated with other assets and liabilities was due to lower value added tax payments and an increase in cash proceeds associated with foreign currency hedging activities 
as part of its capital management  the corporation reviews certain working capital metrics 
for example  the corporation evaluates its accounts receivable and inventory levels through the computation of days sales outstanding and inventory turnover ratio  respectively 
the number of days sales outstanding as of december   increased slightly from the number of days sales outstanding as of december  average inventory turns remained flat in comparison to the average inventory turns as of december  investing activities for the year ended december  used cash of million compared to million of cash used in cash used for investing activities in included million related to the purchase of businesses as compared to million in investing activities for the year ended december  included a million payment  net of cash acquired  to pentair  inc for the acquisition of the porter cable and delta tools group and related transaction costs

the corporation anticipates that its capital spending in will approximate million 
in january  the corporation signed an agreement with assa abloy to sell its remaining european security hardware business  dom  for million 
the dom sales contract provided the corporation with the right to terminate the sales contract in the event that regulatory approval was not obtained by december  the corporation terminated the contract in january because regulatory approval was not obtained 
the corporation is currently marketing the dom business for sale to other potential buyers 
financing activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash used of million in cash provided by financing activities in included million of proceeds  net of discounts and debt issuance costs  received in october upon the issuance of million of senior notes due cash provided by financing activities in also included million of proceeds received upon the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans

at december   the corporation had remaining authorization from its board of directors to repurchase an additional  shares of its common stock 
subsequent to december   the corporation repurchased  shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
in february  the board of directors authorized the corporation to repurchase an additional  shares of its common stock 
after those share repurchases and the additional shares that were authorized by the board of directors  the corporation had remaining authorization from its board of directors to repurchase an additional  shares of its common stock 
on february   the corporation announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 
per share of the corporation s outstanding common stock payable during the first quarter of the 
dividend represents a increase over the 
quarterly dividend paid by the corporation since december future dividends will depend on the corporation s earnings  financial condition  and other factors 
as discussed further in notes of notes to consolidated financial statements  on october   the corporation replaced its billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expired in april with a billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in october as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  the corporation has recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment at december  as a charge to stockholders equity of million  net of tax 
that charge to stockholders equity did not impact the corporation s compliance with covenants under its borrowing agreements or cash flow 
the corporation s expense recognized relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased by approximately million in over the levels 
the corporation anticipates that the expense recognized relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans in will increase by approximately million over the levels 
that increase is partially attributable to the amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses that gave rise to the minimum liability adjustment 
as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation does not anticipate that the funding requirements relating to the pension benefit plans in will be material 
during  the corporation received notices of proposed adjustments from the united states internal revenue service irs in connection with audits of the tax years through the principal adjustment proposed by the irs consists of the disallowance of a capital loss deduction taken in the corporation s tax returns and interest on the deficiency

the corporation has provided adequate reserves in the event that the irs prevails in its disallowance of the previously described capital loss and the imposition of related interest 
should the irs prevail in its disallowance of the capital loss deduction and the imposition of related interest  it would result in a cash outflow by the corporation of approximately million 
if upheld  the court s decision would result in the corporation receiving a refund of taxes previously paid of approximately million  plus interest 
the corporation believes that any such outflow or inflow is unlikely to occur until or later 
the ongoing costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had  and are not expected to have  a material adverse effect on the corporation s capital expenditures or financial position 
the corporation will continue to have cash requirements to support seasonal working capital needs and capital expenditures  to pay interest  to service debt  and to complete the restructuring and integration actions previously described 
for amounts available at december   under the corporation s revolving credit facilities and under short term borrowing facilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements
