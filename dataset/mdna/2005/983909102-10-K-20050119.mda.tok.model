item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below  and to consider all forward looking statements in light of the risks and uncertainties described under the heading outlook and risk factors under item below 
item business development and description of business xeta technologies  inc  xeta  the company  we  us  or our an oklahoma corporation formed in  is a leading provider of converged communications solutions for voice and data applications such as voice over ip voip  wireless  contact centers  and messaging 
we specialize in providing these solutions to multi location mid size and large companies throughout the united states 
in addition to selling these products to customers  we derive a significant portion of our revenues and gross profits from the installation and maintenance of these systems  utilizing our nationwide network of company employed design engineers and service technicians as well as our hour  days per week call center located in our headquarters building in broken arrow  oklahoma 
previous to  our business was focused entirely in the vertical market of hospitality customers 
in we expanded our business into the general commercial market as a voice and data integrator and established a nation wide presence in this market through the acquisition of st 
louis based us technologies systems  inc ust 
in fiscal  we rapidly expanded our business through organic growth and three smaller acquisitions 
from through we battled difficult economic conditions in our industry brought about by the general economic recession that began in early and was followed by the tragic events of september  during this time  our revenues decreased approximately and we therefore focused our efforts on cost containment and maximizing cash flows for debt reduction 
in  we re initiated some of our growth strategies by expanding our sales force and acquiring a small nortel dealer in seattle  washington 
since our expansion into the general commercial market  most of our revenues have been derived from the sale and installation of avaya inc avaya products  a product line that we have represented since in  we added the nortel nortel product line to our product mix 
both of these manufacturers have well respected products and each represents approximately of the us telephony market 
we also sell avaya and nortel products  as well as the hitachi product line  to the lodging market 
all of these products are distributed under nationwide  non exclusive dealer agreements we have with the manufacturers 
also  except for hitachi products which we purchase directly from the manufacturer  we purchase these products from large distributors who provide additional pricing and volume incentives 
our revenues grew by in fiscal after being relatively flat in and revenues for the year just ended were million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in revenues in fiscal reflects a slight increase in demand for the communications systems and services that we sell  but overall we believe that general economic and geopolitical conditions continue to dampen our customers willingness to spend capital resources on communications products 
in fiscal  we purchased substantially all of the assets of bluejack systems  llc bluejack  a small nortel dealer based in seattle 
we paid  for bluejack plus future additional payments that are contingent upon the profitability  as defined in the purchase agreement  of the seattle office 
using bluejack s operations as a genesis  we established a full branch office in seattle to serve customers in that geographic region 
commercial systems sales we sell a broad range of communications systems and applications for the general commercial market  including government agencies 
these products include ip systems that converge voice and data over a single network  wireless systems  traditional communications systems  call center systems  and messaging systems 
we sell these systems under dealer agreements with avaya and nortel 
both of these manufacturers hold significant portions of the communications equipment market and are migrating their customer bases to the new ip based technology platform from traditional telephony systems 
avaya and nortel sell a variety of ip telephony  call center  messaging  and other communications systems designed for small  medium and large enterprises 
we are one of the largest avaya dealers in the us and have been a nortel premium partner dealer since june sales of commercial systems were million in fiscal compared to million and million in and  respectively 
these sales represented   and of total revenues during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in commercial systems sales in compared to the prior year primarily reflects the addition of the nortel product line in  but also reflects improved customer acceptance of the new ip based systems along with modest growth in the overall market for these products 
we sell data networking products to the commercial market under non exclusive dealer agreements with avaya  nortel  cisco systems inc  and hewlett packard co 
hospitality products communications systems 
we sell communications systems to the hospitality industry through nationwide  non exclusive dealer agreements with avaya  nortel  and hitachi 
in addition to most of the features available on the commercial systems above  the systems sold to hospitality customers are equipped with lodging specific software  which integrates with nearly all aspects of the hotel s operations 
we also offer a variety of related products such as voice mail systems  analog telephones  uninterruptible power supplies  announcement systems  and others  most of which also have lodging specific software features 
most of these additional products are sold in conjunction with the sale of new communications systems and  with the exception of voice mail systems  are purchased from regional and national suppliers 
recently  hitachi announced that they would no longer develop and sell communications systems for the lodging industry 
because of our strong relationships with our lodging customers and the fact that we represent the two other major manufacturers in this market  we do not believe that hitachi s decision to leave this market will have a material  negative impact on our operating results in the future 
for a further discussion regarding this matter  see risk factors in management s discussion and analysis below 
call accounting products 
we also market a line of proprietary call accounting systems under the virtual xl vxl series name 
introduced in  the vxl is a pc based system designed to operate on a hotel s local or wide area network  and if that network is connected to the internet  the vxl can also be accessed via an internet connection 
the vxl series was upgraded to a rack mounted  server style system in the vxl systems are our latest technology in a series of call accounting products we have successfully marketed since our inception 
many of those earlier products remain in the field and are supported by our service and technical staff 
sales of communications systems and products to the lodging industry represented   and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
installation and services we provide nation wide customer service  project management  professional services  installation and consulting to support our customers 
our services organization is one of the key differentiators between our competitors and us 
the purchase price of our systems typically includes charges for professional services  project management activities  and installation costs  all of which are reflected as installation and service revenues in our financial statements 
our service organization includes our national service center nsc housed at our headquarters in broken arrow  oklahoma 
our nsc supports our customers who have purchased maintenance contracts on their systems  as well as other customers who purchase service on a time and materials basis 
we employ a network of highly trained technicians who are strategically located in major metropolitan areas and can be dispatched by the nsc to support our customers in the field or install new systems 
we also employ a cadre of design engineers the professional services organization pso trained in the design of the new  converged networks discussed above 
the pso provides high end services to assist our customers in navigating their way to a cost effective and productivity boosting network design 
much of the work done by the pso represents pre sales work and is often not recovered in revenues  representing a significant investment 
we believe  however  that by hiring the most qualified personnel possible and keeping their talents in house  we have built a competitive advantage in the marketplace as many of our competitors do not have the financial strength to make this investment 
for our distributed products  we typically pass on the manufacturer s limited warranty  which is generally one year in length 
labor costs associated with fulfilling the warranty requirements are generally borne by us 
for avaya products that we have sold to non lodging customers  we attempt to sell avaya s post warranty maintenance contracts  for which we earn a commission 
for avaya systems sold to lodging customers  we sell our own maintenance agreement 
nortel and hitachi  unlike avaya  do not have their own telephony field service forces 
therefore  for these products  we aggressively attempt to sell our own post warranty maintenance contracts to all of our customers 
in  we made substantial progress in increasing the revenues from maintenance contracts sold to commercial customers 
this was due primarily to the addition of the nortel product line in the revenues from our maintenance contracts are an important part of our business model as they provide a predictable stream of profitable recurring revenue 
increasing this revenue stream is a priority for us in the next fiscal year 
for proprietary call accounting products sold to the lodging industry  we provide our customers with a limited one year warranty covering parts and labor 
subsequent to the expiration of the warranty  we offer after market service contracts to our lodging customers under one year and multi year service contracts 
we earn a significant portion of our recurring service revenues from lodging customers who maintain service contracts on their systems 
installation and service revenues represented   and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
marketing we market our products and services primarily through our direct sales force to a wide variety of customers including large national companies  mid sized companies  governmental units and agencies  and the hospitality industry 
in addition to our direct marketing effort to customers  a very important part of our marketing effort centers on our relationships with avaya and nortel 
as a national dealer for both manufacturers  we have certain technical and geographical capabilities that help differentiate us in the market 
we aggressively market these capabilities to avaya and nortel 
both organizations utilize us in a variety of ways  from fulfilling certain customer orders to handling entire customer relationships 
we have carefully positioned ourselves as a leading dealer by building our in house engineering capabilities  providing nationwide implementation services  and through access to our hour  days per week service center 
our marketing efforts to the lodging industry rely heavily on our experience and reputation 
over the course of serving this market for over years  we have built strong long term relationships with a wide range of personnel corporate hotel chain personnel  property management officials  industry consultants  hotel owners  and on site financial and or operating officers that can be the key decision makers for the purchase of hotel telecommunications equipment 
we have relationships with nearly all hotel chains and major property management companies 
these relationships are key to our past and future success and our lodging marketing efforts are targeted at strengthening and deepening those relationships rather than the more broad promotional efforts sometimes employed in our marketing efforts to the commercial sector 
major customers during fiscal we did not have any single customer that comprised more than of our consolidated revenues 
however  we sell systems to hotels that are owned or managed by marriott hotels marriott 
marriott is a major customer to our lodging business representing approximately of our total lodging systems sales 
marriott has been a major customer of ours since and we consider our relationship with them to be good 
backlog at december  our backlog of orders for systems sales was million compared to million at the same time last year 
we expect this entire backlog to ship and be recognized as revenue by october  competition commercial 
the market for communications systems  applications and services is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
both avaya and nortel have extensive dealer organizations  including nationwide dealers like ourselves  and smaller regionally focused dealers 
avaya also has a direct sales force that sometimes competes with us on large  national accounts 
in the nortel market  in addition to competing with their extensive dealer network  we also compete with most of the regional bell operating company s rboc s 
some of our competition  the rboc s in particular  have significantly greater financial  sales  marketing  technical  manufacturing and other resources 
in addition to other avaya and nortel dealers  we also face competition from dealers of other large communications equipment suppliers  including cisco systems  inc  siemens aktiengesellschaft  alcatel sa and nec corporation  as well as from a number of other companies  some of which focus on particular segments of the market such as customer relationship management 
hospitality 
we sell avaya  hitachi  and nortel communications systems to the lodging market and  as such  face similar competitive pressures to those discussed above under commercial competition 
however  since the lodging market is a small  niche market  we believe our most effective competitive strengths are the performance and reliability of our proprietary hospitality systems and our high level of service commitment to this unique market 
while we believe that our reputation and nation wide presence contribute significantly to our success in the lodging market  there can be no assurance given that we will be able to continue to expand our market share in the future 
manufacturing we assemble the virtual xl systems  our proprietary call accounting systems sold exclusively to the lodging industry 
these systems comprise less than of our total revenues 
we assemble these systems from an inventory of components  parts and sub assemblies obtained from various suppliers 
these components are purchased from a variety of regional and national distributors at prices which fluctuate based on demand and volumes purchased 
some components  although widely distributed  are manufactured by a single  usually foreign  source and are therefore subject to shortages and price fluctuations if manufacturing is interrupted 
we maintain adequate inventories of components to mitigate short term shortages and believe the ultimate risk of long term shortages is minimal 
the virtual xl systems are based on pc technology  which is continually and rapidly changing 
as a result  some of the components originally designed for use in our systems have been phased out of production and replaced by more advanced technology 
to date  these substitutions have not forced us to substantially redesign our systems and there has been minimal effect on the overall system cost 
there can be no assurance given however  that future obsolescence of key components would not result in unanticipated delays in shipments of systems due to redesign and testing of assemblies 
we use outside contractors to assemble our proprietary printed circuit boards that are part of our call accounting systems 
the components and blank circuit boards are purchased  inventoried  and supplied to the outside contractors for assembly and quality control testing 
we perform various quality control procedures  including powering up completed systems and allowing them to burn in before being assembled into a final unit for a specific customer location  and performing final testing prior to shipment 
all of the other products we sell are purchased as finished goods from the manufacturers distributors 
employees we employed and employees at december  and  respectively 
there were no part time employees 
copyrights  patents and trademarks we recognize that our reputation for quality products and services gives value to our lodging products and service offerings names 
therefore  we place high importance upon protecting such names by obtaining registered trademarks where practicable and appropriate 
we own registered united states trademarks on the following names for use in the marketing of our services and systems xeta  xetaxcel  xact  xpert  xpert  xl  virtual xl  and xtramile 
all of these trademarks are registered on the principal register of the united states patent and trademark office 
we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through a combination of trade secrets  non disclosure agreements  copyright claims  and technical measures 
we believe that patent protection is less significant to protecting our proprietary technology and technical expertise than the other measures listed above 
for this reason  we have never applied for patents on our hardware or software technology with the exception of the technology for xpander 
item properties our principal executive office and the nsc are located in a  square foot  company owned  single story building located in a suburban business park near tulsa  oklahoma 
this facility also houses a warehouse and assembly areas 
the building is located on a acre tract of land 
the property is subject to a mortgage held by bank of oklahoma  na  to secure our credit facility 
our commercial channel shipping operations are primarily located in a leased facility near st 
louis  missouri 
in addition to the warehouse  this facility houses sales staff  technical design  professional services  and installation support personnel 
our seattle branch office is located in leased office space in bellevue  washington a suburb of seattle 
this facility houses sales and technical personnel 
we also lease other office space throughout the us for sales  consulting  and technical staff and have informal office arrangements with our regional technicians to allow for some storage of spare parts inventory 
item legal proceedings on august   the software information industry association siia  an association of software publishers  contacted the company by letter and claimed that xeta had violated the copyright act  usc  et seq 
by allegedly using unlicensed software in xeta s business 
siia made demand that the company audit all of its computers and servers to determine whether it used both licensed and or allegedly unlicensed software for any of siia s members 
the company conducted an audit and determined that some software present on a limited number of company computers was unlicensed 
many of these programs were located on personal computers utilized by employees for both personal and business use  or on computers that were inherited through the company s various acquisitions and were most likely loaded prior to xeta s acquisition of these companies 
because the nature of xeta s liability and the amount of damages due siia was in dispute  early settlement negotiations were unproductive 
therefore on december   the company filed a declaratory judgment action in the us district court for the northern district of oklahoma seeking a judicial determination of liability and damages 
this action is in the discovery stage 
the company is vigorously contesting this matter in court and strongly believes that its procedures regarding maintaining adequate numbers of software licenses are sound 
nevertheless  xeta has potential exposure to damages under the law for possessing unlicensed software and has recorded a loss contingency 
recently  settlement negotiations have resumed 
based upon the current status of the claim management does not believe that the ultimate damages will exceed the current recorded loss contingency in an amount that would materially impact the company s results of operations 
since  we have been monitoring numerous patent infringement lawsuits filed by phonometrics  inc  a florida company  against certain telecommunications equipment manufacturers and hotels who use such equipment 
while we were never named as a defendant in any of these cases  several of our call accounting customers were named defendants and notified us that they would seek indemnification under the terms of their contracts with us 
however  because there were other equipment vendors implicated along with us in the cases filed against our customers  we never assumed the outright defense of our customers in any of these actions 
in october  all of the cases filed against the hotels were dismissed by the court for failure to state a claim 
after years of appeals by phonometrics  all of which were lost on the merits  a final order dismissing the cases with prejudice was entered in november  and the defendant hotels have been awarded attorney fees and costs against both phonometrics and its legal counsel 
phonometrics continues to dispute the amount of fees awarded in some cases  and this issue continues to be litigated by phonometrics

these and other forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance  but rather reflect our current expectations  estimates  and forecasts about the industry and markets in which we operate  and our assumptions and beliefs based upon information currently available to us 
forward looking statements can generally be identified by words such as expects  anticipates  targets  plans  believes  intends  projects  estimates  and similar words or expressions 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  which are difficult to predict 
thus  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in such statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such different results include  but are not limited to  those discussed below under the heading outlook and risk factors  and in our quarterly reports on form q and other reports filed by us with the securities exchange commission 
consequently  investors are cautioned to read and consider all forward looking statements in conjunction with such risk factors and uncertainties 
further  all forward looking statements are subject to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of overview for the year ending october   we earned net income of million or 
per diluted share on revenues of million 
these results compare to earnings of million or 
per diluted share on revenues of million last year 
these results reflect a increase in our revenues that was offset by declines in our gross margins 
operating expenses increased only in  reflecting our continued focus on cost containment 
the over percentage point reduction in gross margins was driven by a percentage point decrease in gross margins earned on systems sales 
this gross margin decline was caused in part by our decision to add the nortel product line to our business  thereby forfeiting approximately percentage points in loyalty rebates provided by avaya 
the remaining reduction in gross margins reflects reductions in various avaya rebate and incentive programs during the year 
as we saw the economy begin to improve in early fiscal  we cautiously began to re initiate some growth initiatives 
these initiatives included expanding our nortel sales force and consideration of acquisition opportunities 
on august   we purchased the assets of bluejack systems  llc  bluejack a seattle based nortel dealer and structured cabling contractor 
the acquisition of bluejack provides us with a jump start in the seattle area for our nortel business 
we are operating the seattle office as a branch model  meaning that most sales and service functions for seattle customers are handled locally 
we also serve the tulsa market with a similar branch model operating philosophy and plan to expand this model as acquisition and expansion opportunities present themselves 
we continue to be very optimistic about our long term prospects 
the new ip based communications systems continue to gain market acceptance  the us economy continues to show gradual improvement  and we believe we are well positioned in the market to be successful 
we spent much of fiscal expanding our infrastructure to encompass the new nortel product portfolio and enhancing our ip telephony capabilities with avaya 
this included establishing our credentials on the nortel product line through rigorous training programs and certification testing 
we accomplished our goals in this area by achieving accreditation on all of the pertinent nortel products 
after establishing our competence on the nortel products  we began expanding our nortel sales resources and at year end our sales resources were evenly split between those who focus primarily on nortel and those who focus primarily on avaya 
the discussion that follows provides more details regarding the factors and trends which affected our financial results  liquidity  and capital resources in fiscal when compared to the previous year 
results of operations year ending october  compared to october  net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal systems sales 
sales of systems and equipment were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
these results reflect improved market conditions and the addition of the nortel product line in fiscal market acceptance of ip based telephony and related technologies continues to improve and nearly all new systems sold are ip based systems 
we expect this trend to continue 
while the overall us economy has shown signs of improvement  we continue to see mixed results as technology spending  especially on communications equipment  remains sluggish 
some customers hesitated to resume their capital spending on technology despite the advances in systems and applications that have occurred in the past few years 
while we expect our systems sales to improve in fiscal  no assurance can be given that customers will not continue to restrict their capital spending budgets to the lower levels experienced during the past three fiscal years 
installation and service revenues 
revenues earned from installation and service related activities were million for fiscal  a increase over fiscal all of our major service revenue streams showed increases compared to the prior year 
these increases include increases in installation and consulting revenues that were driven by increases in systems sales and increases in revenues from maintenance contracts and services that were driven primarily by the addition of the nortel product line 
as discussed above  our systems sales increased in fiscal which resulted in improved installation  project management and programming revenues  all of which are directly associated with new systems sales 
our revenues earned from maintenance contracts increased overall  but were mainly fueled by a increase in revenues earned from service contracts with commercial non lodging customers 
this increase is directly related to the addition of the nortel product line to our business 
we are severely limited in the sale of avaya service contracts to commercial customers because avaya desires to maintain their systems with their own direct service force 
there is no channel conflict  however  in the nortel product line 
consequently  it is a high priority of company management to continue to increase these revenues as they provide a recurring stream of profitable revenues to the company 
we also enjoyed a increase in revenues earned from move  add  and change mac and time and materials t m service activities 
a portion of these revenues are earned from customers who do not have service contracts  but call us regularly for services 
the remaining portion of mac and t m revenues are earned from customers who do have service contracts with us  but need non covered services performed 
as a result  increases in contract revenues generally have a pull through effect on mac and t m revenues 
notably  our mac and t m revenues earned from commercial customers increased last year  again reflecting the addition of the nortel product line to our business 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal while we experienced a decline in gross margins on both systems sales and services  most of the decline in gross margins  percentage points  was related to the gross margins on systems sales 
gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margins we earn on systems sales is volatile and is affected by several factors including we sell a wide variety of products  some of which generate gross margins in excess of and some of which earn gross margins of less than  we sell to several different customer sets  some of which have pre negotiated contracts with avaya which result in lower margins for us  and as a distributor  we receive various forms of financial incentives from our suppliers and from the manufacturers which can vary greatly based on special promotions  product types purchased  the end user customer  seasonality  etc 
all of these factors contribute to the volatility of our systems sales gross margins 
specifically in fiscal  approximately percentage points of the gross margin decline was expected as a result of dropping our exclusive representation of avaya products to the commercial sector and adding the nortel product line 
avaya provides additional loyalty discounts to dealers who represent only avaya products in the marketplace 
therefore  we knew when we added nortel that we would lose these discounts 
the remaining portion of the decline in gross margins on systems sales was not expected and related to additional changes in incentive payment and rebate programs offered and administered by avaya 
the decrease in gross margins earned on systems sales occurred mostly during our first fiscal quarter and then was relatively stable the remainder of the year 
we believe therefore  that the greater part of the erosion of these gross margins is over  however  no assurance can be given that additional changes by avaya or other market conditions will not further erode our gross margins 
the gross margins earned on installation and service revenues were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease was directly related to the cost of starting up our service offering for the nortel product line 
this includes the hiring and training of additional technicians to service nortel products 
most of the additional technical staff was added to support our branch offices in tulsa and seattle and those staff are not yet fully utilized in customer service 
this fact  in conjunction with the additional costs associated with nortel training and certifications  had a negative impact on our service margins 
a final component to our gross margins is the margins earned on other revenues and our corporate cost of goods sold expenses 
other revenues represent sales and cost of goods sold on equipment outside our normal provisioning processes and commissions earned on the sale of manufacturer service contracts 
corporate cost of goods sold represents the cost of our material logistics and purchasing functions 
corporate cost of goods sold declined in fiscal compared to fiscal reflecting management s continued focus on containment of administrative costs 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal the decrease in operating expenses as a percent of sales reflects our continued focus on controlling costs and an increase in the sales and marketing incentive payments received from manufacturers that we represent 
as discussed above under overview  we expanded our sales force and sales management during fiscal as we began to see improvement in the us economy 
however  we continued to closely control our general and administrative expenses and were able hold those expenses relatively flat during fiscal despite the increase in revenues 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are offset by various sales and marketing incentives provided by avaya and nortel under a variety of programs designed to increase the promotion and market presence of their products 
the manufacturers change these programs regularly  so it is difficult to predict whether the offset to operating expenses will remain at levels in fiscal interest and other income 
interest expense consists of interest paid or accrued on our credit facility 
interest expense declined in fiscal by approximately  reflecting lower average debt levels in fiscal also  during fiscal  we capitalized interest costs of approximately  related to our oracle implementation project compared to approximately  in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our term debt by million through cash on hand and funds generated from operations 
net other income in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other expense of approximately  last year 
the primary reason for the change in other income and expense relates to the accrual of a contingent liability in and the partial reversal of that contingency in as more facts about the matter became available 
tax expense 
we have recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of approximately in all years presented 
this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in this decrease reflects lower gross margins earned in fiscal our current business model targets an operating margin of 
however  we will have to realize sustained growth in our revenues  primarily through increased sales of systems to commercial customers  and hold our gross margins to reach this target 
year ending october  compared to october  net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a decline 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal systems sales 
sales of systems and equipment were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease 
these results reflected the static market conditions experienced during fiscal as customers continued to defer most of their buying decisions 
in the early portion of fiscal  we experienced a spike in new orders  indicating that the market for our products was prepared to return to historical levels of growth 
however  order rates quickly returned to fiscal levels as a high degree of pessimism returned to the overall economy reflecting concerns about the war in iraq and future business profits 
installation and service revenues 
revenues earned from installation and service related activities were million in fiscal  an decrease from fiscal this decrease was due primarily to lower discretionary spending by customers on t m work 
the decrease also reflected a slow down in our microsoft consulting business 
most of our customers focused very heavily on cost controls during the economic downturn throughout fiscal and  as a result  deferred all service work that was not essential 
also  because most companies were not increasing their employee base  they were not spending money on expansions of their systems  movement of employees  etc  all of which generate service revenues for us 
installation revenues were flat in fiscal compared to fiscal this result was expected given the relatively stable level of systems sales  which is the primary driver of installation revenues 
contract revenues in fiscal were consistent with fiscal levels 
this revenue stream continued to be derived primarily from our lodging business  which did not expand during fiscal service revenues from the consulting portion of our business declined slightly during fiscal as customers continued to limit their discretionary spending in this area 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase reflected increases in the gross margins of all our revenue sources 
gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal a portion of this increase related to an adjustment we made during fiscal to the reserve for inventory obsolescence 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we increased the inventory reserve and systems cost of goods sold by  without this adjustment  our gross margins on systems sales in fiscal would have been 
the remainder of the improvement in systems sales reflected improvements in sales quoting processes implemented during fiscal by establishing procedures to focus more closely on gross margins prior to finalizing the order and by more aggressively seeking price support from the manufacturer  we were able to significantly improve our margins on systems sales in fiscal over fiscal the gross margins earned on installation and service revenues were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to improvements surrounding our commercial installation cost structure and processes 
despite the fact that installation revenues declined in association with a drop in systems sales  and that a portion of the costs associated with installation activities was fixed payroll related expenses  we were still able to improve the gross margins on installations during fiscal by further consolidation and integration of installation related activities 
also  the margins earned by our national service center improved slightly in fiscal  reflecting additional cost controls deployed during the year 
corporate cost of goods sold declined in fiscal compared to fiscal reflecting management s continued focus on reducing operating costs by controlling headcount and discretionary expenditures 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded an adjustment to decrease the reserve for bad debts by  which resulted in a reduction in bad debt expense 
without this adjustment  fiscal operating expenses would have been of revenues 
the remainder of the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal was related to the loss of certain marketing reimbursement programs from avaya 
avaya replaced these programs with a different incentive system that we participated in  but the contributions received under the new incentive system only partially offset the loss of cost reimbursements under the previous program 
interest and other income 
interest expense consists of interest paid or accrued on our credit facility 
interest expense declined in fiscal by approximately  reflecting lower average debt levels and lower interest rates 
also  during fiscal  we capitalized interest costs of approximately  related to our oracle implementation project compared to approximately  in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our overall bank debt by million through cash on hand and funds generated from operations 
net other expense in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other income of approximately million in fiscal fiscal s results include income from the partial reversal of an acquisition related accrual set up during fiscal and interest income earned from sales type leases 
the amount of the non recurring accrual reversal recorded to other income was  we set up this accrual as part of the purchase of ust in november to reflect the fact that we were inheriting an aggressive tax position taken by ust 
at the time of the acquisition  we chose to accrue for the potential losses to be incurred if the tax position was overturned 
after consultation with our financial and tax advisors and having monitored this matter since the time of the acquisition  we believed it was appropriate to reduce the accrual and did so in fiscal there was no such entry made in fiscal operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in fiscal this increase reflected higher gross margins earned in fiscal while holding operating expenses relatively constant 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  our financial condition was relatively unchanged from the end of fiscal our term debt was reduced million or reflecting scheduled principal payments on the notes 
cash flows from earnings and non cash charges were million 
additional operating cash flows of million were generated from reductions in inventories  sales type leases  prepaid expenses  and from decreases in accrued liabilities and deferred taxes 
offsetting these cash flows were increases in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
in total  our cash used in operations was approximately  our capital expenditures totaled million including approximately  to acquire the net assets of bluejack see development and description of business under item business  above  approximately  invested in our oracle project and approximately  to acquire other capital equipment 
as discussed above  we have continued to invest in the oracle system and at october  we had capitalized million in this project 
we have segregated the cost of this asset into four groups with estimated useful lives of three  five  seven and ten years 
beginning in fiscal  we will be implementing the system in our business and will begin amortizing the cost of the software according to its estimated useful life 
at october   the balance on our working capital revolver was million  leaving million available for additional borrowings 
we believe that this available capacity is sufficient for our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
the revolver is scheduled to expire on september  but we expect to renew it for another month period prior to its expiration 
at october   we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements or received the appropriate waivers and we consider our relationship with our bank to be good 
in addition to the available capacity under our working capital line of credit  we believe we have access to a variety of capital sources such as additional bank debt  private placements of subordinated debt  and public or private sales of additional equity 
however  there are currently no plans to issue such securities 
the table below presents our contractual obligations at october   as well as payment obligations over the next five fiscal years payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases total recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  in december sfas no 
r is a revision of fasb statement  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
the statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  and the company will adopt the standard in the third quarter of fiscal the company has not determined the impact  if any  that this statement will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  sfas which clarifies the types of costs that should be expensed rather than capitalized as inventory 
this statement also clarifies the circumstances under which fixed overhead costs associated with operating facilities involved in inventory processing should be capitalized 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and the company will adopt this standard in its third quarter of fiscal the company has not determined the impact  if any  that this statement will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january of  fasb issued financial interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  which clarified certain issues identified in fin fin r requires an entity to consolidate a variable interest entity if the entity is designated as the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity even if the entity does not have a majority of voting interest 
a variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity where its equity is unable to finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risk and rewards of ownership 
the provisions of this statement apply at inception of any entity created after january  for an entity created before february   the provisions of this interpretation must be applied at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after march  the company does not have any variable interest entities  therefore the implementation of fin did not have a material impact on the company s operating results  financial position  or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in particular  this statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying instrument to conform it to language used in fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
those changes will result in more consistent reporting of contracts as either derivatives or hybrid instruments 
sfas was effective for derivative contracts entered into after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s operating results  financial position  or cash flows 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas was issued in may this statement establishes standards for how certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity are classified and measured 
it requires that many financial instruments previously classified as equity now be classified as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
these financial instruments are as follows financial instrument issued in the form of shares that is mandatorily redeemable that embodies an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem it by transferring its assets at a specified or determinable date or dates or upon an event that is certain to occur  a financial instrument  other than an outstanding share  that  at inception  embodies an obligation to repurchase the issuer s equity shares  or is indexed to such an obligation  and that requires or may require the issuer to settle the obligation by transferring assets  a financial instrument that embodies an unconditional obligation  or a financial instrument other than an outstanding share that embodies a conditional obligation  that the issuer must or may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares  if  at inception  the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on any of the following a a fixed monetary amount known at inception  for example  a payable settleable with a variable number of equity shares  b variations in something other than the fair value of equity shares  for example  a financial instrument indexed to the s p and settleable with a variable number of equity shares  c variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of equity shares  for example  a written put option that could be net share settled 
sfas was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have any effect on the company s operating results  financial position  or cash flows 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the us these accounting principles require us to exercise significant judgment about future events that affect the amounts reported throughout our financial statements 
actual events could unfold quite differently than our previous judgments had predicted 
therefore  the estimates and assumptions inherent in the financial statements included in this report could be materially different once those actual events are known 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or estimates were used  our financial statements could be materially different from those included in this report 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from sales of equipment based on shipment  which is generally easily determined 
revenues from installation and service activities are recognized based upon completion of the activity and customer acceptance  which sometimes requires judgment on our part 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying contract 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
we must make judgments about the collectibility of our accounts receivable to be able to present them at their net realizable value on the balance sheet 
to do this  we carefully analyze the aging of our customer accounts  try to understand why accounts have not been paid  and review historical bad debt problems 
from this analysis  we record an estimated allowance for receivables which we believe will ultimately become uncollectible 
we reduced our estimated allowance for bad debts by  in fiscal and by  in fiscal because of better than expected collection results 
there was no such adjustment made during fiscal we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize our credit risks and believe that our current allowance for doubtful accounts is fairly stated 
realizability of inventory values 
we make judgments about the ultimate realizability of our inventory in order to record our inventory at its lower of cost or market 
these judgments involve reviewing current demand for our products in comparison to present inventory levels and reviewing inventory costs compared to current market values 
we maintain a significant inventory of used and refurbished parts for which these assessments require a high degree of judgment 
in the second half of fiscal  we recorded increases to our provision for excess and obsolete inventories of approximately  reflecting our judgment that our provision was understated at that time 
this amount was recorded as an increase to systems cost of goods sold 
while there were additions to the reserve and write offs of worthless items in fiscal and  there was not a similarly large adjustment made as in fiscal goodwill and other long lived assets 
we have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisitions made in fiscal   and we conduct an annual goodwill impairment review immediately after the completion of the fiscal year to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
in fiscal years and  we engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist us in this review 
to make this assessment each year  we prepared a long term forecast of the operating results and cash flows associated with the major reporting units of our business 
we prepared this forecast in order to determine the net discounted cash flows associated with each of these units 
we  or the consultant in and  then compared the value of the discounted cash flows  less bank debt  to the book value of each of those units 
based on the work performed  we determined that the fair value  based on the discounted cash flows  was greater than our carrying value and therefore no impairment had occurred 
there is a great deal of judgment involved in making this assessment  including the growth rates of our various business lines  gross margins  operating margins  discount rates  and the capital expenditures needed to support the projected growth in revenues 
we have recorded property  equipment  and capitalized software costs at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the determination of useful economic lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
accruals for contractual obligations and contingent liabilities 
on products assembled or installed by us  we have varying degrees of warranty obligations 
we use historical trends and make other judgments to estimate our liability for such obligations 
we also must record estimated liabilities for many forms of federal  state  and local taxes 
our ultimate liability for these taxes depends upon a number of factors including the interpretation of statutes and the mix of our taxable income between higher and lower taxing jurisdictions 
in addition  from time to time we are a party to threatened litigation or actual litigation in the normal course of business 
in such cases  we evaluate our potential liability  if any  and determine if an estimate of that liability should be recorded in our financial statements 
estimating both the probability of our liability and the potential amount of the liability are highly subjective exercises and are evaluated frequently as the underlying circumstances change 
outlook and risk factors our business and our prospects are subject to many risks 
the following items are representative of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could affect our business  our future performance and the outcome of the forward looking statements we make 
our business is adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in the united states and  in particular  market conditions for telecommunications and networking equipment and services 
our business is directly affected by capital spending on technology equipment in the us while capital spending improved slightly during fiscal compared to the very depressed levels experienced from through  demand for our products continues to be weak 
we believe that many customers continue to be concerned about their ability to increase revenues and thereby increase their profitability 
accordingly  they have tried to maintain or improve profitability through cost reduction and reduced capital spending 
we believe that companies may continue to be reluctant to increase spending on communications systems in the near term  therefore  we expect continued pressure on our ability to increase our revenues 
in the short term  our business remains heavily dependent upon avaya  our primary supplier of communications equipment for resale 
also  our long term strategy includes continued commitment to the avaya product line 
although we added nortel equipment to our product line in  sales of nortel products and services continue to be in a ramp up stage 
consequently  in the near term  our financial results will continue to be heavily dependent upon the quality and reputation of avaya s products 
as such  our success in this market will continue to depend heavily upon avaya s ability to develop its products on a timely basis and compete effectively with other manufacturers products in this market 
from a longer term perspective  we expect the avaya product line to continue to be a material part of our business and we have no plans to diminish our avaya related efforts in any way 
therefore  we expect to be dependent to some degree on avaya as a significant supplier of the equipment that we resell 
avaya frequently changes the incentive programs offered to their business partners 
such changes had a detrimental effect on our financial results for the last two years and could do so again in the future 
avaya  like many major manufacturers  provides various financial incentive programs to support increasing the market share  promotion  and sale of its products 
we receive substantial rebates through these incentive programs to offset both costs of goods sold and selling expenses 
we also receive commissions from avaya to sell their maintenance contracts 
these amounts are material to our operating results 
avaya made significant changes to these programs in as a result of some of these changes  the gross margins on our systems sales were lower than they were in previous years 
we expect avaya to continue to change their rebate programs to encourage their dealers to target certain customer segments  typically small to mid sized firms  and to avoid certain other customer sets such as large  national customers which avaya prefers to serve with their direct sales force 
we expect our business model to be at odds with some of the goals of these incentive programs and therefore we expect to continue to experience difficulty in maintaining the level of incentive payments which we have enjoyed in prior years 
we are investing significant resources to add nortel products and services to our product line and our efforts may not produce satisfactory results 
to extend our market reach and reduce our reliance on avaya  we added the nortel product line to our business in we are investing significant resources in the hiring and training of personnel to sell  design  install and maintain nortel products 
during  we acquired bluejack  a small  seattle based nortel dealer to help jump start our nortel product launch 
despite these investments  which are designed to make revenues and gross profits earned from nortel a material part of our business  it may take longer than we expect or this effort may not be successful at all 
revenues and gross profits earned by hotels from guest calls continue to decline resulting in hotels canceling their call accounting maintenance agreements with us 
primarily because of the increasing use of cell phones by guests  hotels have experienced a rapid decline in their revenues and gross profits earned from long distance and other telephone related fees 
this development has severely reduced the importance of call accounting systems in hotels and as a result  many of our customers are considering reducing or eliminating their call accounting maintenance contracts with us 
in fiscal  we earned million in revenues associated with these maintenance contracts 
the loss or reduction in these revenues could materially and negatively impact our operating results 
the introduction of new products could result in reduced revenues  reduced gross margins  reduced customer satisfaction  and longer collection periods 
we are selling a variety of new  highly complex products that incorporate leading edge technology  including both hardware and software 
the early versions of these products  which we are selling currently  can contain software bugs and other defects that can cause the products to not function as intended 
we will be dependent upon avaya and nortel to fix these problems as they occur 
an inability of the manufacturer to correct these problems quickly could result in damage to our reputation  reduced revenues  reduced customer satisfaction  and delays in payments from customers for products purchased 
hitachi has announced that it will no longer manufacture communications systems for the hospitality market 
hitachi  once one of the leading suppliers of traditional pbx systems to the hospitality market  has announced that it will no longer design and manufacture systems for this market 
hitachi has committed to maintaining an adequate supply of parts for their installed systems for the next ten years 
we have many long time lodging customers with significant portfolios of hitachi systems in their hotels 
we have several hundred hitachi systems under service contract producing recurring contract revenues and gross profits for our business 
over the next ten years  all of these customers will have to transition their communications systems to new platforms presenting a risk to us that another vendor will be selected 
while this risk also presents us with an opportunity to sell new systems to our existing hitachi customers  no assurance can be given that hitachi s decision will not negatively impact our financial results in the future 
we are connecting our products to our customers computer networks and problems with the implementation of these products could cause disruption to our customers entire operations 
unlike traditional stand alone voice systems  our new ip based products typically are connected to our customers existing local and wide area networks 
while we believe the risk of our products disrupting other traffic or operations on these networks is low  these products are new and unforeseen problems may occur  which could cause significant disruption to our customers operations 
these disruptions  in turn  could result in reduced customer satisfaction  delays in payments from customers for products purchased  damage to our reputation  and other potential liabilities 
we expect our gross margins to vary over time 
our gross margins are impacted by a variety of factors  including changes in customer and product mix  increased price competition  changes in vendor incentive programs  and changes in shipment volume 
we expect these factors to cause our gross margins to be inconsistent as we make quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons 
if our dealer agreements with the original equipment manufacturers are terminated prematurely or unexpectedly  our business could be adversely affected 
we sell communications systems under dealer agreements with avaya  inc  hitachi telecom  usa  inc  and nortel 
we are a major dealer for avaya and hitachi and consider our relationship with both to be good 
nevertheless  if our strategic relationship with these manufacturers were to be terminated prematurely or unexpectedly  our operating results would be adversely impacted 
furthermore  these agreements require that we meet certain volume commitments to earn the pricing structure provided in the dealer agreements 
failure to meet these requirements could cause material  adverse consequences to our gross margins and overall operating results 
we are dependent upon a few suppliers 
our growth and ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our capability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from suppliers 
both avaya and nortel utilize a two tier distribution model in which a few third party companies super distributors distribute their products to their respective dealer communities 
in the case of one such distributor  they distribute both avaya and nortel products 
the limited amount of distribution available for each of these product lines increases our risks of interruptions in the supply of products in the future 
the success of our business depends significantly upon our ability to retain and recruit highly skilled personnel 
our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled and qualified technical and sales personnel is critical to our success 
competition for such employees in the rapidly changing telecommunications industry is typically intense  although the current economic conditions have temporarily eased some of this pressure 
as we have transformed our company into an integrated communications solutions provider  we have invested heavily in the hiring and training of personnel to sell and service our new products and service offerings 
if we are unable to retain our skilled employees or to hire additional qualified personnel as needed  it could adversely impact our ability to implement our strategies efficiently and effectively 
we are faced with intense competition and rapidly changing technologies in the industry and market in which we operate 
the market for our products and services is highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technologies 
as the industry itself evolves and new technologies and products are introduced into the marketplace  new participants enter the market and existing competitors seek to strengthen their positions and expand their product service offerings 
there has been a trend toward industry consolidation  which can lead to the creation of stronger competitors who may be better able to compete as a sole source vendor for customers 
while we believe that through the expansion and transformation of the last few years  we are well positioned to compete effectively in the marketplace  our failure to maintain or enhance this position could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we might have to record a significant goodwill impairment loss in the event our business was to suffer a severe decline 
under sfas  we are required to evaluate the fair value of each of our reporting units annually and determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value of those reporting units  and if so  an impairment loss is recorded in our statement of operations 
the determination of fair value is a highly subjective exercise and can produce very different results based on the assumptions used and methodologies employed 
it is likely that if our financial results were to decline substantially and if macroeconomic conditions eroded  we would have to record a non cash impairment loss in our statement of operations 
the amount of such impairment is impossible to predict  but would likely be material to our operating results and could represent a significant portion of our shareholders equity 
the successful completion of the upgrade to our technology infrastructure and information systems is critical to our ability to effectively and efficiently operate our business in the future 
also  implementation of the system will significantly increase our amortization expense 
our success in navigating the current market will depend heavily upon our ability to assemble the necessary information to make informed decisions and implement those decisions quickly and effectively 
for the past months  we have been working on a major upgrade to our technology infrastructure and information systems 
this upgrade will result in a consolidation from four critical legacy systems to one 
due to constraints that we have imposed on capital spending  we have purposely slowed down the development of this system 
furthermore  at our current revenue and activity levels  conversion to this new system is not critical to our near term success 
however  we believe it is prudent to proceed with the conversion while our revenues are at these lower levels in anticipation of future growth which we believe will require upgraded and consolidated technology infrastructure 
while we are taking great care to properly plan this implementation and to test the solution fully prior to the conversion  there can be no guarantees given that the conversion will not disrupt our operations 
our targeted operating margins of may not be achievable 
we believe that our current business model would support a target operating margin of 
this target assumes that we can generate significantly higher revenues  maintain our gross margins  and operate our material logistics and general and administrative functions at about the same levels as we currently do 
these assumptions are not tested through past experience operating in the commercial sector of our market and may not be achievable 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
historically  our stock is not widely followed by investment analysts and is subject to price and volume trading volatility 
this volatility is sometimes tied to overall market conditions and may or may not reflect our financial performance 
it is likely that this volatility will continue 
our business is subject to the risks of tornadoes and other natural catastrophic events and to interruptions caused by manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism 
our corporate headquarters and nsc is located in northeastern oklahoma  a region known to be part of tornado alley 
a significant natural disaster  such as a tornado  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
any such event could also cause a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  acts of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruption to our economy and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the assembly or shipment of our products  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we may be subject to infringement claims and litigation  which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain products and services 
third parties  including customers  may assert claims or initiate legal action against our manufacturers  suppliers  customers or us  alleging that the products we sell infringe on another s proprietary rights 
regardless of the merit of a claim  these types of claims can be time consuming  result in costly litigation  or require us to enter into costly license agreements 
in some instances  a successful claim could prevent us from selling a particular product or service 
we have not conducted patent searches on the third party products we distribute to independently determine whether they infringe upon another s proprietary rights  nor would it be practical or cost effective for us to do so 
rather  we rely on infringement indemnities given to us by the manufacturers of the equipment we distribute 
however  because these indemnities are not absolute and in some instances have limits of coverage  no assurance can be given that in the event of an infringement claim  our indemnification by the equipment manufacturer will be adequate to hold us harmless or that we will even be entitled to indemnification by the equipment manufacturer 
if any infringement or other intellectual property claim is brought against us and is successful  whether it is based upon a third party manufacturer s equipment that we distribute or upon our own proprietary products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we are currently in litigation with the software information industry association siia 
siia has alleged that have used unlicensed software in our business 
our audit of our systems determined that we had a limited number of software titles being used on our computers that were unlicensed 
many of these titles were used by employees for their personal use 
we are vigorously contesting this matter in court and strongly believe that our procedures regarding maintaining adequate numbers of software licenses is sound 
nevertheless  we have recorded a contingent liability reflecting our estimate of the damages that may be paid in this litigation 
if our position regarding this matter proves to be unsuccessful  there can be no assurance given that the amounts accrued will be sufficient to cover the damages assessed 
we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 
in addition to the specific factors discussed above  we are subject to certain risks that are inherent in doing business  such as general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general economic and political conditions  costs of obtaining insurance  unexpected death of key employees  changes in employment laws and regulations  changes in tax laws and regulations  and other events that can impact revenues and the cost of doing business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
we did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during the fiscal year 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business due to our utilization of variable debt 
our credit facility bears interest at a floating rate at either the london interbank offered rate libor at october  plus to or the bank s prime rate at october  less to 
in an effort to manage the risk associated with variable interest rates  in november we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with variable rate interest payments  on amortizing notional amounts of million 
the swap agreement expired on november  and was not renewed 
the pay fixed rates under the swap agreement was 
the receive floating rates for the swap agreement was month libor  resetting monthly 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately  in fiscal and would not have had a material impact on our financial position or cash flows
