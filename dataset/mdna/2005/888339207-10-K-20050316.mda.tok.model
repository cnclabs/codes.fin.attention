part i item business general 
titanium metals corporation timet or the company was originally formed in and was incorporated in delaware in timet is one of the world s leading producers of titanium melted and mill products 
the company is the only producer with major titanium production facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium consumption 
timet is currently the only major producer of titanium sponge  a key raw material  in the united states 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications where these qualities are essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium  the number of non aerospace end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
today  numerous industrial uses for titanium exist  including chemical plants  power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in emerging markets with such diverse uses as offshore oil and gas production installations  military armor  automotive  geothermal facilities and architectural applications 
timet s products include titanium sponge  melted products  mill products and industrial fabrications 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers that  like timet  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
based on the company s industry experience and information obtained from publicly available external resources eg  united states geological survey  international titanium association and japan titanium society  the company estimates that it accounted for approximately of worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products in and and approximately and of worldwide titanium sponge production in and  respectively 
the company s long term strategy is to maximize the value of its core aerospace business while also developing new markets  applications and products to help reduce its traditional dependence on the aerospace industry 
in the near term  the company continues to focus on maintaining a lean cost structure  managing its raw material requirements  improving the quality of its products and processes and taking other actions to continue to generate positive cash flow and further expand its profitability 
industry 
the titanium industry historically has derived a substantial portion of its business from the aerospace industry 
aerospace demand for titanium products  which includes both jet engine components eg  blades  discs  rings and engine cases and air frame components eg  bulkheads  tail sections  landing gear  wing supports and fasteners can be broken down into commercial and military sectors 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers such as timet 
military aerospace sector shipments are largely driven by government defense spending in north america and europe 
the following table illustrates the company s estimates of titanium industry mill product shipments during and year ended december  change metric tons mill product shipments to commercial aerospace sector   military aerospace sector   total aerospace industry   aggregate mill product shipments to all industries   the company s business is more dependent on aerospace demand than is the overall titanium industry  as approximately of the company s mill product shipment volume in was to the aerospace industry commercial aerospace and military aerospace  whereas approximately of the overall titanium industry s shipment volume in was to the aerospace industry  as indicated by the above table 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in the performance of most titanium companies 
over the past years  the titanium industry had cyclical peaks in mill product shipments in  and and cyclical lows in   and prior to  demand for titanium reached its highest level in when industry mill product shipments reached approximately  metric tons 
however  since  industry mill product shipments have fluctuated significantly  primarily due to a continued change in demand for titanium from the commercial aerospace sector 
the company estimates that industry shipments approximated  metric tons in and  metric tons in the company currently expects total industry mill product shipments will increase from levels to approximately  metric tons in the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  traditionally issues forecasts for commercial aircraft deliveries each january and july 
according to the airline monitor  large commercial aircraft deliveries for the to period peaked in with aircraft  including wide body aircraft that use substantially more titanium than their narrow body counterparts 
large commercial aircraft deliveries totaled including wide bodies in the following table summarizes the airline monitor s most recently issued forecast january for large commercial aircraft deliveries over the next five years increase decrease forecasted deliveries over previous year year total wide bodies total wide bodies deliveries of titanium generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year  although this varies considerably by titanium product 
this correlates to the company s cycle  which historically precedes the cycle of the aircraft industry and related deliveries 
although global traffic increased in compared to  persistently high oil prices had an adverse impact on the commercial airline industry 
according to the airline monitor  the worldwide commercial airline industry s estimated operating loss for was billion  and the projected operating loss is billion 
according to rom associates  inc  a leading aerospace research company  global airline passenger traffic returned to pre september  levels in october the company estimates that industry mill product shipments into the commercial aerospace sector will approximate  metric tons in military aerospace programs were the first to utilize titanium s unique properties on a large scale  beginning in the s 
titanium shipments to military aerospace markets reached a peak in the s before falling to historical lows in the early s after the end of the cold war 
however  the importance of military markets to the titanium industry is expected to rise in coming years as defense spending budgets increase in reaction to terrorist activities and global conflicts 
several of today s active us military programs  including the c  f a  f and f began during the cold war and are forecast to continue production through the end of the current decade 
in addition to these established us programs  new us programs offer growth opportunities for increased titanium consumption 
the f a raptor is currently in low rate initial production  and the us air force currently plans to purchase between and aircraft over the life of the program  depending on funding levels 
the recent budget proposed by president bush provides for an overall increase in spending compared to current levels  principally to continue funding military ground efforts in iraq and afghanistan 
the current budget proposal also calls for an end to procurement of the f a in  with total f a production capped at aircraft 
however  final procurement decisions must receive congressional approval 
in october  lockheed martin corporation was awarded the contract for construction of the f joint strike fighter jsf 
the jsf is expected to enter low rate initial production in  and although no specific delivery patterns have been established  procurement is expected to extend over the next to years and to include as many as  to  planes 
european military programs also have active aerospace programs offering the possibility for increased titanium consumption 
production levels for the saab gripen  eurofighter typhoon  dassault rafale and dassault mirage are all forecasted to remain steady through the end of the decade 
since titanium s initial applications in the aerospace sector  the number of end use markets for titanium has significantly expanded 
established industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
rapid growth of the chinese and other southeast asian economies has brought unprecedented demand for titanium intensive industrial equipment 
titanium continues to gain acceptance in many emerging market applications  including automotive  military armor  energy and architecture 
although titanium is generally higher cost than other competing metals  in many cases customers find the physical properties of titanium to be attractive from the standpoint of weight  performance  longevity  design alternatives  life cycle value and other factors 
although the company estimates that emerging market demand presently represents only about of the total industry demand for titanium mill products  the company believes emerging market demand  in the aggregate  could grow at double digit rates over the next several years 
the company is actively pursuing these markets 
the automotive market continues to be an attractive emerging market segment due to its potential for sustainable long term growth 
for this reason  in  timet established timet automotive  which is focused on developing and marketing proprietary alloys and processes specifically suited for automotive applications 
titanium is now used in several consumer car applications as well as in numerous motorcycles 
at the present time  titanium is primarily used for exhaust systems  suspension springs and engine valves in consumer vehicles 
in exhaust systems  titanium provides for significant weight savings  while its corrosion resistance provides life of vehicle durability 
in suspension spring applications  titanium s low modulus of elasticity allows the spring s height to be reduced by to compared to a steel spring  which  when combined with the titanium s low density  permits to weight savings over steel spring suspension systems 
titanium suspension springs and exhaust applications are also attractive compared to alternative lightweight technologies because the titanium component can often be formed and fabricated on the same tooling used for the steel component it is typically replacing 
titanium is also making inroads into other automotive applications  including turbo charger wheels  brake parts and connecting rods 
titanium engine components provide mass reduction benefits that directly improve vehicle performance and fuel economy 
the decision to select titanium components for consumer car  truck and motorcycle components remains highly cost sensitive  however  the company believes titanium s acceptance in consumer vehicles will expand as the automotive industry continues to better understand the benefits titanium offers 
utilization of titanium on military ground combat vehicles for armor applique and integrated armor or structural components continues to gain acceptance within the military market segment 
titanium armor components provide the necessary ballistic performance while achieving a mission critical vehicle performance objective of reduced weight 
in order to counteract increased threat levels  titanium is being utilized on vehicle upgrade programs in addition to new builds 
based on active programs  as well as programs currently under evaluation  the company believes there will be additional usage of titanium on ground combat vehicles that will provide continued growth in the military market segment 
the oil and gas market utilizes titanium for down hole logging tools  critical riser components  fire water systems and saltwater cooling systems 
additionally  as offshore development of new oil and gas fields moves into the ultra deep water depths  market demand for titanium s light weight  high strength and corrosion resistance properties is creating new opportunities for the material 
the company has a group dedicated to developing the expansion of titanium use in this market and in other non aerospace applications 
products and operations 
the company is a vertically integrated titanium manufacturer whose products include i titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  ii melted products ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various alloys  iii mill products that are forged and rolled from ingot or slab  including long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip and pipe  and iv fabrications spools  pipefittings  manifolds  vessels  etc 
that are cut  formed  welded and assembled from titanium mill products 
during the past three years  all of timet s net sales were generated by the company s integrated titanium operations its titanium melted and mill products segment  its only business segment 
business and geographic segment financial information is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
titanium sponge so called because of its appearance is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal 
the first step in timet s sponge production involves the chlorination of titanium containing rutile ores derived from beach sand with chlorine and petroleum coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
the company s titanium sponge production facility in henderson  nevada incorporates vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining a vacuum in the chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the sponge mass  and then the mass is mechanically pushed out of the distillation vessel  sheared and crushed  while the residual magnesium chloride is electrolytically separated and recycled 
titanium ingot is a cylindrical solid shape that  in timet s case  weighs up to metric tons 
titanium slab is a rectangular solid shape that  in timet s case  weighs up to metric tons 
each ingot or slab is formed by melting titanium sponge  scrap or both  usually with various other alloys such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium 
titanium scrap is a by product of the forging  rolling  milling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for finished titanium products and components 
the melting process for ingot and slab is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and to meet customer specifications 
in most cases  timet uses its ingot and slab as the starting material for further processing into mill products 
however  it also sells ingot and slab to third parties 
the company sends certain products either to the company s service centers or to outside vendors for further processing before being shipped to customers 
the company s customers either process the company s products for their ultimate end use or for sale to third parties 
during the production process and following the completion of manufacturing  the company performs extensive testing on its products 
the inspection process is critical to ensuring that the company s products meet the high quality requirements of its customers  particularly in aerospace component production 
the company certifies that its products meet customer specification at the time of shipment for substantially all customer orders 
the company currently is reliant on several outside processors one of which is owned by a competitor to perform certain rolling  finishing and other processing steps in the us  and certain melting and forging steps in france 
in france  the processor is also a joint venture partner in the company s owned subsidiary  timet savoie  sa timet savoie 
during the past several years  the company has made significant strides toward reducing the reliance on competitor owned sources for these services  so that any interruption in these functions should not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
distribution 
the company sells its products through its own sales force based in the us and europe and through independent agents and distributors worldwide 
the company s distribution system also includes eight company owned service centers five in the us and three in europe  which sell the company s products on a just in time basis 
the service centers primarily sell value added and customized mill products  including bar  flat rolled sheet and strip 
the company believes its service centers provide a competitive advantage because of their ability to foster customer relationships  customize products to suit specific customer requirements and respond quickly to customer needs 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium ingot  slab and mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloys 
the following table summarizes the company s raw material usage requirements for its melted and mill products percentage of total raw material requirements internally produced sponge purchased sponge titanium scrap alloys the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
rutile ore is currently available from a limited number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  south africa and sri lanka 
the company purchases the majority of its supply of rutile ore from australia 
the company believes the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and does not anticipate any interruptions of its rutile supplies 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience interruptions 
chlorine is currently obtained from a single supplier near the company s sponge plant in henderson  nevada 
while the company does not presently anticipate any chlorine supply problems  there can be no assurances the chlorine supply will not be interrupted 
in the event of supply disruption  the company has taken steps to mitigate this risk  including establishing the feasibility of certain equipment modifications to enable it to utilize material from alternative chlorine suppliers or to purchase and utilize an intermediate product which will allow the company to eliminate the purchase of chlorine if needed 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
during  the company was the only major us producer of titanium sponge and one of only five major worldwide producers the others are located in russia  kazakhstan and two in japan 
however  it cannot supply all of its needs for all grades of titanium sponge internally and is dependent  therefore  on third parties for a substantial portion of its sponge requirements 
titanium melted and mill products require varying grades of sponge and or scrap depending on the customers specifications and expected end use 
presently  timet and certain companies in japan are the only producers of premium quality sponge that currently have complete approval for all significant demanding aerospace applications 
over the past few years  sponge producers in russia and kazakhstan have progressed in their efforts to obtain approval for the use of their sponge into all aerospace applications 
this qualification process is likely to continue for several more years 
historically  the company has purchased sponge predominantly from producers in kazakhstan and japan 
in september  the company entered into a sponge supply agreement  effective from january  through december   which requires minimum annual purchases by the company 
the company has no other long term sponge supply agreements 
since  the company has also purchased sponge from the us defense logistics agency dla stockpile  however  the dla stockpile is expected to become fully depleted during the company expects to continue to purchase sponge from a variety of sources during the company utilizes a combination of internally produced  customer returned and externally purchased titanium scrap at its melting locations 
such scrap consists of alloyed and commercially pure solids and turnings 
internally produced scrap is generated in the company s factories during both melting and mill product processing 
customer returned scrap is generally part of a supply agreement with a customer  which provides a closed loop arrangement resulting in supply and cost stability 
externally purchased scrap comes from a wide range of sources  including customers  collectors  processors and brokers 
the company anticipates that to of the scrap it will utilize during will be purchased from external suppliers  as compared to for the company also occasionally sells scrap  usually in a form or grade it cannot economically recycle 
market forces can significantly impact the supply or cost of externally produced scrap 
the amount of scrap generated in the supply chain varies during the titanium business cycles 
during the middle of the cycle  scrap generation and consumption are in relative equilibrium  minimizing disruptions in supply or significant changes in market prices for scrap 
increasing or decreasing cycles tend to cause significant changes in the market price of scrap 
early in the titanium cycle  when the demand for titanium melted and mill products begins to increase  the company s requirements and those of other titanium manufacturers precede the increase in scrap generation by downstream customers and the supply chain  placing upward pressure on the market price of scrap 
the opposite situation occurs when demand for titanium melted and mill products begins to decline  placing downward pressure on the market price of scrap 
as a net purchaser of scrap  the company is susceptible to price increases during periods of increasing demand 
although this phenomenon normally results in higher selling prices for melted and mill products  which tends to offset the increased material costs  the company is somewhat limited in its ability to raise prices by the portion of its business that is under long term pricing agreements 
all of the company s major competitors utilize scrap as a raw material in their melt operations 
in addition to use by titanium manufacturers  titanium scrap is used in steel making operations during production of interstitial free steels  stainless steels and high strength low alloy steels 
recent strong demand for these steel products  especially from china  has produced a significant increase in demand for titanium scrap at a time when titanium scrap generation rates are at low levels  partly due to lower commercial aircraft build rates 
these events created a significantly tightened supply of titanium scrap during  and the company expects this trend to continue and worsen during for timet  this will translate to lower availability and higher cost for externally purchased scrap in the near term 
the company s ability to recover these material costs via higher selling prices to its customers is uncertain 
the expected increase in commercial aircraft build rates over the next several years  as previously discussed  could have the effect of relieving the shortage of titanium scrap 
various alloys used in the production of titanium products are also available from a number of suppliers 
however  the recent high level of global demand for steel products also has resulted in a significant increase in the prices for several alloys  such as vanadium and molybdenum 
although availability is not expected to be a problem  the company s cost for these alloys during could be as much as double that of customer agreements 
the company has long term agreements ltas with certain major aerospace customers  including  among others  the boeing company boeing  rolls royce plc and its german and us affiliates rolls royce  united technologies corporation pratt whitney and related companies and wyman gordon company wyman gordon  a unit of precision castparts corporation pcc 
most of these ltas expire from through  subject to certain conditions  and generally provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements or firm annual volume commitments and ii fixed or formula determined prices although some contain elements based on market pricing 
generally  the ltas require the company s service and product performance to meet specified criteria and contain a number of other terms and conditions customary in transactions of these types 
certain provisions of these ltas have been amended in the past and may be amended in the future to meet changing business conditions 
in certain events of nonperformance by the company or the customer  the ltas may be terminated early 
although it is possible that some portion of the business would continue on a non lta basis  the termination of one or more of the ltas could result in a material effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
the ltas were designed to limit selling price volatility to the customer  while providing timet with a committed base of volume throughout the aerospace business cycles 
to varying degrees  these ltas effectively obligate timet to bear the majority of the risks of increases in raw material and other costs  but also allow timet to benefit from decreases in such costs 
during the third quarter of  the company and wyman gordon agreed to terminate the purchase and sale agreement associated with the formation of the titanium castings joint venture previously owned by the two parties 
the company paid wyman gordon a total of million in three quarterly installments in connection with this termination  which included the termination of certain favorable purchase terms 
the company recorded a one time charge for the entire million as a reduction to sales in the third quarter of concurrently  the company entered into new long term purchase and sale agreements with wyman gordon that expire in during  the company reached a settlement of certain litigation between timet and boeing related to the parties lta entered into in pursuant to the settlement  the company received a cash payment of million from boeing 
under the terms of the lta  as amended  in through  boeing advances timet million annually less per pound of titanium product purchased by boeing subcontractors under the boeing lta during the preceding year 
effectively  the company collects less from boeing than the lta selling price for each pound of titanium product sold directly to boeing and reduces the related customer advance recorded by the company 
for titanium products sold to boeing subcontractors  the company collects the full lta selling price  but gives boeing credit by reducing the next year s annual advance by per pound 
the boeing customer advance is also reduced as the company recognizes income under the take or pay provisions of the lta  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
under a separate agreement  timet must establish and hold buffer stock for boeing at timet s facilities  for which boeing will be invoiced for an lta sale by timet when such material is produced into a mill product by timet 
see item md a for additional information regarding the boeing lta 
the company also has an lta with valtimet sas valtimet  a manufacturer of welded stainless steel and titanium tubing that is principally sold into the industrial markets 
valtimet is a owned affiliate of timet 
the lta was entered into in and expires in under the lta  timet has agreed to provide a certain percentage of valtimet s titanium requirements at formula determined selling prices  subject to certain conditions 
certain provisions of this contract have been amended in the past and may be amended in the future to meet changing business conditions 
markets and customer base 
the following table summarizes the company s sales revenue by geographical location year ended december  percentage of total sales revenue sales revenue to customers within north america europe other further information regarding the company s external sales  net income  long lived assets and total assets by segment can be found in the company s consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
substantially all of the company s sales and operating income are derived from operations based in the us  the us  france and italy 
as shown in the below table  the company generates over two thirds of its sales revenue from sales to the aerospace industry commercial and military sectors 
the company expects that a similar percentage of its sales revenue will be to the aerospace industry 
as previously noted  the company has ltas with certain major aerospace customers  including boeing  rolls royce  utc and wyman gordon 
this concentration of customers may impact the company s overall exposure to credit and other risks  either positively or negatively  in that all of these customers may be similarly affected by the same economic or other conditions 
the following table provides supplemental sales revenue information regarding the company s dependence on certain industries and customer relationships year ended december  percentage of total sales revenue sales revenue to aerospace industry commercial aerospace sector military aerospace sector total aerospace industry customers under ltas significant customers under ltas rolls royce and other rolls royce suppliers ten largest customers significant customers pcc and related entities greater than of net sales 
includes direct sales to certain of the pcc related entities under the terms of the rolls royce ltas 
the primary market for titanium products in the commercial aerospace industry consists of two major manufacturers of large over seats commercial airframes boeing commercial airplanes group a unit of boeing and airbus owned by european aeronautic defence and space company and owned by bae systems 
in addition to the airframe manufacturers  the following four manufacturers of large civil aircraft engines are also significant titanium users rolls royce  general electric aircraft engines  pratt whitney and societe nationale detude et de construction de moteurs daviation snecma 
the company s sales are made both directly to these major manufacturers and to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use the company s titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce aircraft and or jet engine build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on the company 
the backlogs for boeing and airbus reflect orders for aircraft to be delivered over several years 
changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of airlines can result in rescheduling or cancellation of contractual orders 
accordingly  aircraft manufacturer backlogs are not necessarily a reliable indicator of near term business activity  but may be indicative of potential business levels over a longer term horizon 
the following table shows the estimated firm order backlogs for boeing and airbus  as reported by the airline monitor at december  firm order backlog all planes airbus    boeing    firm order backlog wide body planes airbus boeing wide body planes as of total firm order backlog wide body planes eg  boeing   and and airbus a  a and a tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their airframes  engines and parts than narrow body planes eg  boeing and and airbus a  a and a  and newer models of planes tend to use a higher percentage of titanium than older models 
additionally  boeing generally uses a higher percentage of titanium in its airframes than airbus 
for example  the company estimates that approximately metric tons  metric tons and metric tons of titanium are purchased for the manufacture of each boeing  and  respectively  including both the airframes and engines 
the company estimates that approximately metric tons  metric tons and metric tons of titanium are purchased for the manufacture of each airbus a  a and a  respectively  including both the airframes and engines 
at year end  a total of firm orders had been placed for the airbus a superjumbo jet  a program officially launched in with anticipated first deliveries in current estimates are that approximately metric tons of titanium metric tons for the airframe and metric tons for the engines will be purchased for each a manufactured 
additionally  at year end  a total of firm orders have been placed for the boeing dreamliner  a program officially launched in april with anticipated first deliveries in although the will contain more composite materials than a typical boeing airplane  the company s preliminary estimates are that approximately metric tons of titanium metric tons for the airframe and metric tons for the engines will be purchased for each manufactured 
however  the final titanium buy weight is likely to vary because the is still in the design phase 
outside of aerospace markets  the company manufactures a wide range of products for customers in the chemical process  oil and gas  consumer  sporting goods  automotive  power generation and armor armament industries 
approximately of the company s sales revenue in  in and in was generated by sales into industrial and emerging markets  including sales to valtimet for the production of welded tubing 
for the oil and gas industry  the company provides seamless pipe for downhole casing  risers  tapered stress joints and other offshore oil and gas production equipment  along with firewater piping systems 
in armor and armament  the company sells plate products for fabrication into applique plate for protection of the entire ground combat vehicle as well as the primary vehicle structure 
in addition to melted and mill products  which are sold into the aerospace  industrial and emerging markets  the company sells certain other products such as titanium sponge  titanium tetrachloride and titanium fabrications 
sales of these other products represented of the company s sales revenue in both and and in during  the company modified its method of calculating its backlog to include replenishment purchase orders placed under consignment relationships 
the company believes inclusion of these orders provides a more accurate reflection of the company s overall backlog 
using the modified methodology for all periods  the company s backlog of unfilled orders was approximately million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  over of the year end backlog is scheduled for shipment during the company s order backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business activity 
the company has explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
the company will also continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of melted and mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  france  germany  italy  russia  china and the united kingdom 
in addition  producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be used or modified without substantial capital expenditures to process titanium products 
there are currently five major  and several minor  producers of titanium sponge in the world 
three of the major producers have announced plans to increase sponge production capacity 
timet is currently the only major us sponge producer 
the company believes that entry as a producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment and substantial technical expertise 
the company s principal competitors in the aerospace titanium market are allegheny technologies incorporated ati and rti international metals  inc rti  both based in the united states  and verkhnaya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo  based in russia 
uniti a joint venture between ati and vsmpo  rti and certain japanese producers are the company s principal competitors in the industrial and emerging markets 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of us participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates and  with respect to japan  russia  kazakhstan and ukraine  import duties including antidumping duties 
however  since  imports of titanium sponge  ingot and mill products  principally from russia and kazakhstan  have increased and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent the company is able to take advantage of this situation by purchasing sponge from such countries for use in its own operations  the negative effect of these imports on the company can be somewhat mitigated 
generally  imports of titanium products into the us are subject to a normal trade relations tariff 
for tariff purposes  titanium products are broadly classified as either wrought billet  bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing or unwrought sponge  ingot and slab 
the united states maintains a trade program  referred to as the generalized system of preferences or gsp program  designed to promote the economies of a number of lesser developed countries referred to as beneficiary developing countries by eliminating duties on a specific list of products imported from any of these beneficiary developing countries 
of the key titanium producing countries outside the us  russia and kazakhstan are currently regarded as beneficiary developing countries under the gsp program 
for most periods since  imports of titanium wrought products from any beneficiary developing country notably russia  as a producer of wrought products were exempted from us import duties under the gsp program 
in  timet filed a petition seeking the removal of duty free treatment under the gsp program for imports of titanium wrought products into the us from russia 
during the third quarter of  president bush approved the petition 
this action resulted in a return to the normal tariff on imports of titanium wrought product from russia 
in  kazakhstan filed a petition seeking gsp status on imports of titanium sponge into the us  which  if granted  would have eliminated the tariff currently imposed on titanium sponge imported into the us from any beneficiary developing country notably russia and kazakhstan  as producers of titanium sponge 
kazakhstan s petition was denied in the japanese government has recently raised the elimination or harmonization of tariffs on titanium products  including titanium sponge  for consideration in the next round of multi lateral trade negotiations through the world trade organization the so called doha round  scheduled to start in late a us competitor has recommended the elimination of us tariffs on titanium sponge imports for consideration in the doha round 
the company has urged that no change be made to these tariffs  either on wrought or unwrought products 
timet has successfully resisted  and will continue to resist  efforts to eliminate duties on sponge and unwrought titanium products whether through the gsp program or otherwise  although no assurances can be made that the company will continue to be successful in these activities 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  any or all of these tariffs could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge  ingot and mill products and thus the company s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
research and development 
the company s research and development activities are directed toward expanding the use of titanium and titanium alloys in all market sectors 
key research activities include the development of new alloys  development of technology required to enhance the performance of timet s products in the traditional industrial and aerospace markets and applications development for automotive and other emerging markets

on september   the company exchanged of its outstanding bucs for its series a preferred stock  resulting in a million non cash  non operating gain see liquidity and capital resources other and note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense related to the remaining debt payable to the capital trust million at december  is approximately million per year 
dividends on the series a preferred stock will approximate the reduction of interest expense on debt payable to the capital trust in determining income attributable to common stockholders 
during  the company exercised its right to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures  effective for the december  scheduled interest payment 
interest continued to accrue at the coupon rate on the principal and unpaid interest until the company s board of directors approved resumption of scheduled quarterly interest payments on the subordinated debentures beginning with the payment on june  the company s board also approved payment of all previously deferred interest on the subordinated debentures

timet is the primary obligor on two million workers compensation bonds issued on behalf of a former subsidiary  freedom forge corporation freedom forge  which timet sold in freedom forge filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in  and discontinued payment on the underlying workers compensation claims 
during  timet received notices that the issuers of the bonds were required to make payments on the first bond with respect to certain of these claims and were requesting reimbursement from timet 
as of december   the company has made aggregate payments under the two bonds of million  and million remains accrued for future payments 
timet may revise its estimated liability under these bonds in the future as additional facts become known or claims develop 
income taxes 
the company operates in several tax jurisdictions and is subject to varying income tax rates 
as a result  the geographic mix of pretax income or loss can impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
for the years ended december   and  the company s income tax rate varied from the us statutory rate primarily due to changes in the deferred income tax valuation allowance related to the company s tax attributes with respect to the more likely than not recognition criteria during those periods 
the company did not recognize a deferred tax benefit related to its or us losses and  accordingly  increased its us deferred tax valuation allowance by million in and by million in during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge to other comprehensive loss to reflect an increase in its uk minimum pension liability 
the related tax effect of this charge resulted in the company s shifting from a net deferred tax liability position to a net deferred tax asset position 
based on the company s recent history of uk losses  its near term outlook and management s evaluation of available tax planning strategies  the company determined that it would not recognize this deferred tax asset because it did not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria and recorded a uk deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million through other comprehensive income 
additionally  the company determined that it would not recognize deferred tax benefits related either to future uk losses or future increases in uk minimum pension liabilities for an uncertain period of time 
accordingly  the company increased its uk deferred tax valuation allowance by million in during  the company s deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to income from continuing operations decreased by million primarily due to the utilization of the us and us net operating loss nol carryforwards  the benefit of which had previously not met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
as of december   the company had cumulative valuation allowances in the us and us of approximately million offsetting its deferred income tax assets  primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards  minimum pension liability and other temporary differences 
the company has concluded that the benefit from these items does not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  in part because the company has not demonstrated a recent pattern of taxable income for a time period sufficient to overcome the negative evidence generated by prior operating losses 
the company will continue to monitor and evaluate these deferred income tax asset valuation allowances in light of all available evidence  and it is possible that at some point in the future the company will conclude that the weight of positive evidence is sufficient to support reversal of some or all of its valuation allowances 
the company periodically reviews its deferred income tax assets to determine if future realization is more likely than not 
during the third quarter of  due to a change in estimate of the company s ability to utilize the benefits of its nol carryforwards in germany  the company determined that its deferred income tax asset in germany now meets the more likely than not recognition criteria 
accordingly  the company reversed the million valuation allowance attributable to such deferred income tax asset 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a deferred income tax benefit related to a million decrease in the company s us deferred income tax asset valuation allowance attributable to the company s recognition  for us income tax purposes only  of a capital gain on the fourth quarter sale of certain property located at the company s henderson  nevada facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company expects to recognize a corresponding deferred income tax expense in  when the gain is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted into law 
the new law provides for a special deduction for certain dividends received in from controlled foreign corporations 
because certain details in the new law lack clarification  and the impact of the special dividend received deduction to the company is dependent  in part  on the company s foreign and domestic taxable income  the company has not yet determined whether it will benefit from the new law 
in  the company plans to evaluate both clarifying guidance on the new law from the internal revenue service and its year to date taxable income activity to determine the level of benefit  if any  the company will derive from the special dividend received deduction 
beginning in  the new law also provides for a special deduction from us taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of a us company s qualified income from domestic manufacturing activities as defined 
although the company believes that the majority of its operations meet the definition of qualified domestic manufacturing activities  the company does not expect to benefit from the special manufacturing deduction in  primarily because the company projects its us taxable income in will be fully offset by its existing us nol carryforwards 
during the first quarter of  the job creation and worker assistance act of the jcwa act was signed into law 
the company benefited from provisions of the jcwa act  which liberalized certain net operating loss and alternative minimum tax restrictions 
as a result  the company recognized million of refundable us income taxes during the first quarter of the company received million of this refund in the fourth quarter of and the remaining million in the third quarter of see also note to the consolidated financial statements

in  timet returned to full year profitability for the first time since this was primarily achieved due to significant increases in demand for the company s products into all markets  as well as continued focus on controlling costs 
the company is encouraged by what it expects for the near future  with prices for its products continuing to rise  build rates of commercial aircraft forecasted to increase  and greater potential for increases in several emerging markets  including military armor  energy and automotive applications 
over the past several quarters  the company has seen the availability of raw materials tighten  and  consequently  the prices for such raw materials increase 
the company currently expects that a shortage in raw materials is likely to continue throughout and into  which could limit the company s ability to produce enough titanium products to fully meet customer demand 
in addition  timet has certain customer long term agreements that limit the company s ability to pass on all of its increased raw material costs 
the company currently expects its net sales revenue to range from million to million  which is an increase of to from mill product sales volume  which was  metric tons in  is expected to range from  and  metric tons in  an increase of to 
melted product sales volume  which was  metric tons in  is expected to range from  and  metric tons in  an increase of to 
the company also expects mill product average selling prices to increase by to in  as compared to  and melted product average selling prices to increase from to in  as compared to the company s cost of sales is affected by a number of factors including customer and product mix  material yields  plant operating rates  raw material costs  labor and energy costs 
raw material costs  which include sponge  scrap and alloys  represent the largest portion of the company s manufacturing cost structure  and  as previously discussed  continued cost increases are expected during scrap and certain alloy prices have more than doubled from year ago prices  and increased energy costs also continue to have a negative impact on gross margin 
in addition  the company s cost of sales can be significantly affected by adjustments to its lifo inventory reserve  as was the case during and the company currently expects production volumes to continue to increase in  with overall capacity utilization expected to approximate to in as compared to in 
however  practical capacity utilization measures can vary significantly based on product mix 
current expectations are that gross margin during will range from to of net sales 
selling  general  administrative and development expenses is expected to increase from million during to approximately million during  or from to of projected net sales  which is a decrease from of net sales in the company anticipates that boeing will purchase a significantly higher amount of titanium during as compared to and  therefore  expects the amount of take or pay income recognized during to decrease to between million and million 
the take or pay income will continue to be reported as operating income  but will not be included in sales revenue  sales volume or gross margin 
the company presently expects operating income for of million to million  which represents a to increase from operating income earned in dividends on the company s series a preferred stock should approximate million in the company expects net income attributable to common stockholders to range from million to million 
these net income estimates include a million non operating gain related to the sale of certain property adjacent to the company s henderson  nevada plant site to basic management  inc and certain affiliates bmi  a owned subsidiary of valhi 
this gain is primarily comprised of i million in cash received upon closing of the sale in november and ii the anticipated reversal of a million accrual currently recorded by the company for potential environmental issues related to the property  which obligation will be assumed by bmi 
this gain has been deferred and will be recognized when the company completes its construction of a wastewater treatment facility on its henderson plant site and can cease use of certain settling ponds located on the property sold to bmi 
the company currently expects the wastewater treatment facility to be completed and operational in the second quarter of these net income estimates exclude a net income tax benefit of million to million that the company may recognize during if a reversal of a portion of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance with respect to its us and us net operating loss carryforwards is determined to be appropriate under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the company currently expects to generate million to million in cash flow from operations during capital expenditures during are expected to approximate million 
the increased spending over primarily reflects the remaining million related to construction of the wastewater treatment facility  as well as additional capacity improvements as the company continues to prepare for increased demand by certain customers under long term agreements 
depreciation and amortization should approximate million in the company currently expects to make contributions of approximately million to its defined benefit pension plans during  and expects pension expense to approximate million in non gaap financial measures 
in an effort to provide investors with information in addition to the company s results as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  the company has provided the following non gaap financial disclosures that it believes may provide useful information to investors o the company discloses percentage changes in its mill and melted product selling prices in us dollars  which have been adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in product mix 
the company believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors by allowing them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in product mix  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices 
depending on the composition of changes in product mix  the percentage change in selling prices excluding the effect of changes in product mix can be higher or lower than such percentage change would be using the actual product mix prevailing during the respective periods  o in addition to disclosing percentage changes in its mill product selling prices adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in product mix  the company also discloses such percentage changes in billing currencies  which also excludes the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors by allowing them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the various actual billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar strengthens weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in selling prices in billing currencies will be higher lower than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  and o the company discloses operating income and net income excluding the impact of the boeing take or pay income 
the company believes this provides investors with useful information to better analyze the company s business and possible future earnings during periods after december   at which time the company will no longer receive the positive effects of the take or pay income 
liquidity and capital resources the company s consolidated cash flows for each of the past three years are presented below 
the following should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
year ended december  in thousands cash used provided by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net cash used provided by operating  investing and financing activities    operating activities 
the titanium industry historically has derived a substantial portion of its business from the aerospace industry 
the aerospace industry is cyclical  and changes in economic conditions within the aerospace industry significantly impact the company s earnings and operating cash flows 
cash flow from operations has been a primary source of the company s liquidity 
changes in titanium pricing  production volume and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect the company s liquidity 
certain items included in the determination of net loss have an impact on cash flows from operating activities  but the impact of such items on cash may differ from their impact on net loss 
for example  pension expense and opeb expense will generally differ from the outflows of cash for payment of such benefits 
in addition  relative changes in assets and liabilities generally result from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such relative changes can significantly impact the comparability of cash flow from operations from period to period  as the income statement impact of such items may occur in a different period than that in which the underlying cash transaction occurs 
for example  raw materials may be purchased in one period  but the cash payment for such raw materials may occur in a subsequent period 
similarly  inventory may be sold in one period  but the cash collection of the receivable may occur in a subsequent period 
the company s bottom line increased from a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  to net income attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december accounts receivable increased during primarily due to increased sales  as fourth quarter net sales  the primary source of the year end accounts receivable balance  increased over the year ago period 
accounts receivable decreased during primarily due to improved collection efforts with the company s customers  partially offset by the weakening of the us dollar compared to the british pound sterling and the euro 
accounts receivable decreased significantly during primarily as a result of reduced sales  partially offset by an increase in aging of accounts as certain customers extended their payment terms to the company in response to unfavorable economic conditions 
inventories increased during as a result of increased run rates and related inventory build in order to meet expected customer demand during  as well as the effects of increased raw material costs 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in the company s lifo reserve at december  inventories decreased during primarily due to the company s concentrated focus on inventory reduction during  partially offset by a decrease in the company s lifo inventory reserve of million 
inventories decreased during primarily as a result of reduced production in the fourth quarter of  a million increase in the company s lifo inventory reserve and an increase in the company s reserves for excess inventories  which the company recorded in response to decreased demand for its products and other changes in business conditions 
changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflect  among other things  the timing of payments to suppliers of titanium sponge  titanium scrap and other raw material purchases 
accrued liabilities increased during primarily due to i a million net increase in the company s accrual for incentive compensation for potential employee profit sharing payments to be made in and ii a million increase to the company s accrual for costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation at the company s henderson  nevada facility 
these increases were partially offset by i payment of the million final installment related to termination of the prior wyman gordon agreement  ii a million reduction of the company s vacation accrual related to the company s modification of its vacation policy for its u 
s salaried employees and iii a million reclassification of the company s us defined benefit pension liability from current to noncurrent  as the company s short term cash contribution requirements decreased significantly 
pursuant to an agreement between timet and boeing  boeing advances timet million annually less per pound of titanium product purchased by boeing subcontractors during the preceding year

the company s capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in  principally for replacement of machinery and equipment and for capacity maintenance 
additionally  the amount includes million related to construction in progress on the wastewater treatment facility 
see results of operations outlook for discussion of the million of proceeds from sale of property in henderson 
during the fourth quarter of  the company deposited funds into certificates of deposit and other interest bearing accounts as collateral for certain company obligations in lieu of entering into letters of credit 
these deposits  which are restricted as to the company s use  provide the company with interest income as opposed to interest expense incurred through the use of letters of credit 
during  certain of these deposits were liquidated in favor of entering into letters of credit

during the first quarter of  the company amended its us credit facility to  among other things  allow the company the flexibility to remove the equipment component from the determination of the company s borrowing availability in order to avoid the costs of an appraisal 
the company took advantage of this flexibility during the first quarter of  effectively reducing the company s current borrowing availability in the us by million 
however  the company can regain this availability by completing an updated equipment appraisal 
interest currently accrues at rates based on libor plus and bank prime rate plus 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding as of december  was 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the company s us assets 
the us credit agreement prohibits the payment of distributions in respect of the capital trust s bucs and dividends on the company s series a preferred stock if excess availability defined as borrowing availability less outstanding borrowings and certain contractual commitments such as letters of credit is less than million

under this agreement  the company is required to maintain a lock box arrangement whereby daily net cash receipts are used to reduce outstanding borrowings 
accordingly  any outstanding balances under the us credit agreement are classified as a current liability  regardless of the maturity date of the agreement 
the company s subsidiary  timet uk  has a credit agreement that provides for borrowings limited to the lesser of pound million or a formula determined borrowing base derived from the value of accounts receivable  inventory and property  plant and equipment borrowing availability

timet uk was in compliance with all covenants for all periods during the years ended december  and the uk overdraft facility is subject to annual review in december of each year and was renewed in december during the second quarter of  timet uk received an interest bearing intercompany loan from a us subsidiary of the company enabling timet uk to reduce its borrowings under the uk facilities to zero 
this loan was repaid in full during the third quarter of as of december   the company had no borrowings under the uk facilities  and unused borrowing availability was approximately million 
the company also has overdraft and other credit facilities at certain of its other european subsidiaries

as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities  and unused borrowing availability was approximately million 
no dividends were paid by timet on its common stock during  or during the year ended december   the company paid dividends on its series a preferred stock in the amount of million 
in addition  subsequent to december   the company s board of directors declared a dividend of per share  payable on march  to holders of record of series a preferred stock as of the close of trading on march  contractual commitments 
as more fully described in notes   and to the consolidated financial statements  the company was a party to various debt  lease and other agreements at december  that contractually commits the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including pricing  quantity and date of payment payment due date after total contractual commitment in thousands capital leases operating leases      notes payable   debt payable to capital trust and accrued interest thereon at december    purchase obligations raw materials    other      other contractual obligations   includes interest payments due under the capital lease agreements 
the company s us credit agreement matures in however  this agreement requires the company s daily net cash receipts to be used to reduce outstanding borrowings and  therefore  the outstanding balance at december  is classified as a current liability

the company has excluded any potential commitment for funding of retirement and postretirement benefit plans from this table 
however  such potential future contributions are discussed below  as appropriate  in liquidity and capital resources defined benefit pension plans and liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as more fully discussed in results of operations non operating income expense  the company is the primary obligor on two million workers compensation bonds issued on behalf of freedom forge 
the company has fully expensed the obligation under one of the bonds  but based upon current claims analysis  the company has expensed only million on the other bond  although it is potentially obligated for the remaining million 
additionally  the company has entered into letters of credit to collateralize i potential workers compensation claims in ohio and nevada and ii future usage of electricity in nevada 
the company s excess availability under its us credit agreement has been reduced by million and million  respectively  related to such letters of credit 
defined benefit pension plans 
as of december   the company maintains three defined benefit pension plans one each in the us  the us and france 
prior to december   the us maintained two plans  which were merged as of that date 
the majority of the discussion below relates to the us and us plans  as the french plan is not material to the company s consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations or statements of cash flows 
the company recorded consolidated pension expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pension expense for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return 
the discount rate the company utilizes for determining pension expense and pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds to year maturities that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies generally merrill lynch  moody s  solomon smith barney and ubs warburg as well as composite indices provided by the company s actuaries 
changes in the company s discount rate over the past three years reflect the decline in such bond rates during that period 
the company establishes a rate that is used to determine obligations as of the year end date and expense for the subsequent year 
the company used the following discount rate assumptions for its pension plans discount rates used for obligation at obligation at obligation at december  december  december  and expense in and expense in and expense in us plan s uk plan in developing the company s expected long term rate of return assumptions  the company evaluates historical market rates of return and input from its actuaries  including a review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on broad equity large cap  small cap and international and bond corporate and government indices as well as anticipation that the plans active investment managers will generate premiums above the standard market projections 
the company used the following long term rate of return assumptions for its pension plans long term rates of return used for obligation at obligation at obligation at december  december  december  and expense in and expense in and expense in us plan s uk plan lowering the expected long term rate of return on the company s us plans assets by from to would have increased pension expense by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased the company s us plans pension expense by approximately million 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on the company s uk plan s assets by from to would have increased pension expense by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased the company s uk plan s pension expense by approximately million 
during the second quarter of  the company transferred all of its us plans assets into the combined master retirement trust cmrt 
the cmrt is a collective investment trust established by valhi to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by valhi and certain related companies 
the cmrt held of timet common stock at december   however  the company s plan assets are invested only in a portion of the cmrt that does not hold timet common stock 
at december   valhi and related entities or persons excluding the cmrt held approximately of timet s outstanding common stock and approximately of the company s series a preferred stock 
harold c 
simmons  chairman of the board of directors of valhi and vice chairman of the board of directors of timet  is the sole trustee of the cmrt  a member of the trust investment committee for the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt  the average annual rate of return earned by the cmrt  as calculated based on the average percentage change in the cmrt s net asset value per cmrt unit for each applicable year  was 
the cmrt earned an annual return of in  and the cmrt s last year and year average annual returns were and  respectively 
the cmrt s annual rates of return from inception through december  have varied from a high of a return in to a low of a loss in 
during that same period  the s p s annual rates of return have varied from a high of a return in to a low of a loss in 
at december   the cmrt s asset mix based on an aggregate asset value of million was us equity securities  foreign equity securities  debt securities and cash and other 
the cmrt s trustee and investment committee actively manage the investments within the cmrt 
such parties have in the past  and may again in the future  periodically change the relative asset mix based upon  among other things  advice they receive from third party advisors and their expectation as to what asset mix will generate the greatest overall return 
based on the above  the company increased its long term rate of return assumption to for december  pension obligations and for pension expense for its us plan and maintained the assumption for december  pension obligations and pension expense 
because of market fluctuations and prior funding strategies  actual asset allocation as of december  was equity securities and fixed income securities for the uk plan 
during  the trustees for the uk plan selected a new investment advisor effective in for the uk plan and modified its asset allocation goals 
the company s future expected long term rate of return on plan assets for its uk plan is based on an asset allocation assumption of equity securities and fixed income securities by the end of and equity securities and fixed income securities by the end of  and all current contributions to the plan are invested wholly in fixed income securities in order to gradually effect the shift 
based on various factors  including improved economic and market conditions  gains on the plan assets during and projected asset mix  the company increased its assumed long term rate of return for december  pension obligations and for pension expense to for its uk plan and maintained the assumption for december  pension obligations and for pension expense 
although the expected rate of return is a long term measure  the company will continue to evaluate its expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust it as considered necessary 
the expected return on the fair value of the plan assets  determined based on the expected long term rate of return  is a component of pension expense 
this methodology further recognizes actual investment gains or losses ie  the difference between the expected and actual returns based on the market value of assets in pension expense through amortization in future periods based upon the expected average remaining service life of the plan participants 
unrealized gains or losses may impact future periods to the extent the accumulated gains or losses are outside the corridor as defined by sfas no 
based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  the company estimates that its us plan will have pension expense of approximately million in and approximately  in and pension income of approximately million in a increase decrease in the discount rate would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in and and increase decease projected pension income by approximately million in a increase decrease in the long term rate of return would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in and approximately million in and increase decrease projected pension income by approximately million in based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions including an exchange rate of pound  the company estimates that pension expense for its uk plan will approximate million in  million in and million in a increase decrease in the discount rate would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in  million in and million in a increase decrease in the long term rate of return would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in  million in and million in actual future pension expense will depend on actual future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in the company s pension plans 
the company made cash contributions of approximately million in  million in and million in to the us plans and cash contributions of approximately million in  million in and million in to the uk plan 
based upon the current underfunded status of the plans and the actuarial assumptions being used for  the company believes that it will be required to make the following cash contributions exclusive of any required employee contributions over the next five years projected cash contributions us plan usplan total in millions  and using an exchange rate of pound for uk plan year ending december  the us plan s paid benefits of approximately million in  million in and million in  and the uk plan paid benefits of approximately million in  million in and million in based upon current projections  the company believes the plans will be required to pay the following benefits over the next ten years projected retirement benefits us plan usplan total in millions  and using an exchange rate of pound for uk plan year ending december  through the value of the plans assets has fluctuated dramatically over the past three years based mainly on performance of the plans equity securities 
the us plans assets were million  million and million at december   and  respectively  and the uk plan s assets were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the combination of actual investment returns  changing discount rates and changes in other assumptions has a significant effect on the company s funded plan status plan assets compared to projected benefit obligations 
in  the effect of positive investment returns and cash contributions was more than offset by the decline in the discount rate and certain changes in mortality and other retirement assumptions  thereby increasing the under funded status of the us plan by million to million at december  in  the effect of positive investment returns in the uk plan was also more than offset by the decline in the discount rate and certain changes in mortality and retirement assumptions  as well as the effect of the weakening dollar compared to the british pound sterling  thereby increasing the underfunded status of the uk plan by million to million at december  the uk and uk plans were underfunded by million and million  respectively  at december  based upon the change in the funded status of the plans during  the company was required to record a net additional minimum pension liability charge net of tax to equity of million  reflecting additional comprehensive loss of million for the us plan and million related to the uk plan 
postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
the company provides limited postretirement healthcare and life insurance opeb benefits to a portion of its us employees upon retirement 
the company funds such opeb benefits as they are incurred  net of any retiree contributions 
the company paid opeb benefits  net of retiree contributions  of million in  million in and million in the company recorded consolidated opeb expense of million in  million in and million in opeb expense for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term health care trend rate 
the discount rate the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and opeb obligations is the same as that used for the company s us pension plans 
lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased the company s opeb expense by less than million 
the company estimates the expected long term health care trend rate based upon input from specialists in this area  as provided by the company s actuaries 
in estimating the health care trend rate  the company considers industry trends  the company s actual healthcare cost experience and the company s future benefit structure 
for  the company used a beginning health care trend rate of  which is projected to reduce to an ultimate rate of in if the health care trend rate changed by for each year  opeb expense would have increased decreased by approximately million in for  the company is using a beginning health care trend rate of  which is projected to reduce to an ultimate rate of in based on a discount rate of  a health care trend rate as discussed above and various other assumptions  the company estimates that opeb expense will approximate million in  million in and million in a increase decrease in the discount rate would decrease increase projected opeb expense by less than million in  and a increase decrease in the health care trend rate for each year would increase decrease the projected service and interest cost components of opeb expense by approximately million in  and based upon current projections  the company will be required to pay the following opeb benefits  net of retiree contributions  over the next ten years projected opeb payments in millions year ending december  through environmental matters

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments  and select from a range of possible estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory allowances  asset lives  impairments of investments in marketable securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the related underlying actuarial assumptions  the realization of deferred income tax assets  and accruals for asset retirement obligations  environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates and judgments  to varying degrees  on historical experience  advice of external specialists and various other factors it believes to be prudent under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts and such estimates  assumptions and judgments are regularly subject to revision 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the company s financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these policies and estimates  as well as discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates 
inventory allowances 
the company values approximately of its inventory using the lifo method  with the remainder stated primarily using an average cost method 
the company periodically reviews its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and records any write down equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about alternative uses  market conditions and other factors 
impairment of long lived assets 
generally  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  may not be recoverable  the company undertakes an evaluation of the assets or asset group 
if this evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is not recoverable  the amount of the impairment would typically be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows or appraised values 
all relevant factors are considered in determining whether an impairment exists 
in  no such events or circumstances indicated the need to perform such evaluation 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed an entity wide impairment assessment in response to continued poor conditions in the commercial aerospace market 
in order to complete this assessment  the company identified its lowest level of identifiable cash flows  resulting in the identification of four asset groups us  us  france and italy 
of these asset groups  italy is not reliant on sales into the commercial aerospace market and therefore an analysis of the potential impairment of this asset group was not considered necessary  so only the us  us and france asset groups were evaluated 
the result of this assessment led the company to conclude that there was no impairment related to the long lived assets in these three asset groups tested  as the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the net carrying value of the applicable net assets in each of the three asset groups 
although management utilizes certain external information sources such as the airline monitor as the basis for aerospace sales volume projections  significant management judgment is required in estimating other factors that are material to future cash flows including  but not limited to  customer demand  the company s market position  selling prices  competitive forces and manufacturing costs 
future cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that the company will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
the company also completed an impairment assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets upon its adoption of sfas no 
in  which resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million

valuation and impairment of securities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company s marketable securities acquired in  including the shares of compx contributed by the company and held by cgi based upon the company s redemption option  are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value based upon quoted market prices  with unrealized gains and or losses included in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
the company evaluates its investments in marketable securities whenever events or conditions occur to indicate that the fair value of such investments has declined below their carrying amounts 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the carrying amount of the security is written down to fair value 
in  no such events or circumstances indicated the need to perform such evaluation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the company undertook assessments of its investment in smc 
those assessments indicated that it was unlikely that the company would recover its then existing carrying amount of the smc securities in accordance with the securities contractual terms and that an other than temporary decline in the fair value of its investment had occurred 
accordingly  the company recorded impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of and million in the first quarter of the securities were not publicly traded and  accordingly  quoted market prices were unavailable 
the estimate of fair value required significant judgment and considered a number of factors including  but not limited to  the financial health and prospects of smc and market yields of comparable securities 
deferred income tax valuation allowances 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and related guidance  the company is required to record a valuation allowance if realization of deferred tax assets is not more likely than not 
substantial weight must be given to recent historical results and near term projections  and management must assess the availability of tax planning strategies that might impact either the need for  or amount of  any valuation allowance 
see results of operations income taxes for discussion of the company s analysis of its deferred income tax valuation allowances 
pension and opeb expenses and obligations 
the company s pension and opeb expenses and obligations are calculated based on several estimates  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
the company reviews these rates annually with the assistance of its actuaries 
see further discussion of the factors considered and potential effect of these estimates in liquidity and capital resources defined benefit pension plans and liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
revenue recognition 
sales revenue is generally recognized when the company has certified that its product meets the related customer specifications  the product has been shipped  and title and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
payments received from customers in advance of these criteria being met are recorded as customer advances until earned 
amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales 
sales revenue is stated net of price and early payment discounts 
other loss contingencies 
accruals for estimated loss contingencies  including  but not limited to  product related liabilities  environmental remediation and litigation  are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure is made when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses often requires analysis of various projections that are dependent upon the future outcome of multiple factors  including costs  the findings of investigations and actions by the company and third parties 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to indebtedness 
the company typically does not enter into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage its interest rate market risk 
at december   all of the company s bank indebtedness was denominated in us dollars and bore interest at variable rates  generally related to spreads over bank prime rates and libor 
because the company s bank indebtedness reprices with changes in market interest rates  the carrying amount of such debt is believed to approximate fair value 
at december   the company had no bank indebtedness 
the following table summarizes the company s bank variable rate indebtedness and related maturities as of december  contractual maturity date interest rate in millions u 
s 
dollars weighted average 
the subordinated debentures held by the capital trust provide a fixed coupon and are exposed to market risk from changing interest rates 
the bucs issued by the capital trust are publicly traded and may provide the best available proxy for the fair value of the underlying subordinated debentures 
based upon the last traded value of the bucs on or before december  per bucs  the fair value of the outstanding subordinated debentures related to the  outstanding bucs approximated million at december foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of its international operations 
the company does not enter into currency forward contracts to manage its foreign exchange market risk associated with receivables  payables or indebtedness denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the particular entity 
see results of operations european operations in item md a for further discussion 
commodity prices 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in commodity prices as a result of its long term purchase and supply agreements with certain suppliers and customers 
these agreements  which offer various fixed or formula determined pricing arrangements  effectively obligate the company to bear i the risk of increased raw material and other costs to the company that cannot be passed on to the company s customers through increased titanium product prices in whole or in part or ii the risk of decreasing raw material costs to the company s suppliers that are not passed on to the company in the form of lower raw material prices 
securities prices 
during the year ended december   the company acquired certain publicly traded equity securities that are exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the securities as reported on the new york stock exchange 
the aggregate market value of these equity securities at december  was million  as compared to a cost basis of million 
the potential change in the aggregate market value of these securities  assuming a change in prices  would be million at december  see also note to the consolidated financial statements
