table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements 
for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from results discussed in the forward looking statements  see forward looking statements and certain considerations contained in the introduction to this report 
overview we operate the largest dedicated bulk tank truck network in north america based on bulk service revenues  and we believe we have more than twice the revenues of our closest competitor in our primary chemical bulk transport market in the us the bulk tank truck market in north america includes all items shipped by bulk tank truck carriers and consists primarily of the shipping of chemicals  gasoline and food grade products 
we transport a broad range of chemical products and provide our customers with value added services  including intermodal  transloading  tank cleaning  dry bulk hauling  leasing and other logistics services 
we extensively utilize third party affiliate terminals and owner operator drivers in our core bulk service network 
our light asset based operations enable us to minimize our capital investments and increase the flexibility of our cost structure  while providing superior localized customer service 
we are a core carrier for many of the fortune companies engaged in chemical processing  including the dow chemical company  procter gamble company  ei dupont and ppg industries  and we provide services to most of the top chemical producers in the world with us operations 
we expect to grow as our customers continue to outsource more of their logistics needs to full service carriers 
following the merger in of our predecessor companies  chemical leaman corporation clc and montgomery tank lines mtl  we began assembling a management team to guide the integration of clc and mtl and position us for profitable future growth 
our management team undertook several major initiatives designed to enhance our operating flexibility  upgrade and standardize our business processes  improve our customer service and increase our profitability as reflected in our revenue growth from million in to million in we significantly expanded the use of affiliate terminals and owner operator drivers in our transformation to a more light asset based business model 
revenues from our affiliate partners and owner operator drivers accounted for  and of our transportation revenues in  and  respectively 
we installed a new order entry  dispatch and billing system  a new decision support system and a new mobile satellite communication system 
we established new standard operating procedures for customer service and safety and implemented a new field operating structure 
we added several terminals and tank wash facilities in strategic locations to fill out our core bulk network 
we began offering additional complementary  value added services that offer attractive growth potential  including intermodal services and third party logistics 
we implemented a new yield management system and other profit improvement initiatives 
we sold a non core petroleum and mining trucking business  as well as the assets for the glass trucking business of levy transport  ltd 
we sold certain assets of ppi 
we have strengthened our senior management team in  including adding a new chief operating officer  chief financial officer and general counsel 
we have realized  and believe that we will continue to realize  significant additional financial benefits from these and other strategic initiatives 
our revenue is principally a function of the volume of shipments by the bulk chemical industry  our market share  and the amount spent on tank truck transportation as opposed to other modes of transportation such as rail 
the volume of shipments of chemical products are  in turn  affected by many other industries  including consumer and industrial products  
table of contents automotive  paint and coatings  and paper  and tend to vary with changing economic conditions 
additionally  we also provide leasing  tank cleaning  transloading and warehousing  which are presented as other service revenue 
we also broker insurance products for drivers and affiliates through an independent third party 
the principal components of our operating costs include purchased transportation  salaries  wages  benefits  annual tractor and trailer maintenance costs  insurance  technology infrastructure and fuel costs 
we believe our use of affiliates and owner operators provides a more flexible cost structure  increases our asset utilization and increases our return on invested capital 
the expanded use of affiliates and owner operator drivers results in a more variable operating cost business since affiliates and owner operators are paid fixed  contracted percentages of revenue  which affords us some protection against a business decline and lower pricing 
we believe that the entrepreneurial nature of our affiliate and owner operator model enables us to achieve higher productivity and better cost control on an overall basis when compared to company owned operations 
we have historically focused on maximizing cash flow and return on invested capital 
our affiliate program has greatly reduced the amount of capital needed for us to maintain and grow our terminal network 
in addition  the extensive use of owner operators reduces the amount of capital needed to operate our fleet of tractors  which have shorter economic lives than trailers 
we believe the most significant factors to achieving future business growth are the ability to a recruit and retain drivers  especially given the new hours of service regulations effective during  b add new affiliates  and c further expand our existing network by adding new customers and obtaining additional business from existing customers 
since the end of  we have added ten new affiliates that manage terminals 
excluding the converted company terminals  these new affiliates provided incremental revenues of million for the twelve months ended december  on november   we consummated our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
on this date  we sold an additional  shares of common stock to an existing shareholder for per share as a result of the exercise of his preemptive rights in connection with the conversion of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock redeemable preferred stock to common stock 
our subsidiary  qd llc concurrently consummated a the private offering of million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes  and b the entry into the credit facility consisting of a million delayed draw term loan facility  a million revolving credit facility  and a million pre funded letter of credit facility 
we utilized the proceeds from these transactions to repay all of our previous debt  except for million of floating interest rate notes  our million overdraft line of credit facility  and our outstanding capital leases 
during and going forward  we expect our interest expense to decrease from historical levels due to the reduction of outstanding debt and the reduction of interest rates from the previously outstanding debt 
we believe that our capital structure provides us the flexibility necessary to continue expanding our scope of service capabilities  providing us the ability to be a full service provider to companies looking to outsource their logistics needs 
on july   we sold certain assets of ppi including accounts  customer lists and insurance contracts 
these assets were related to the business of offering insurance to individuals who are not owner operators  affiliates and fleet owners doing business regularly with us qdi persons 
the sales price was million with million paid at closing and the remaining million to be paid in equal monthly installments over twelve months 
we may receive an additional amount of up to million in september of based on the excess of the buyer s annual revenues from this business  as defined in the sales agreement  over million 
we recorded a loss of million related to this transaction in the third quarter of for the retained business  which encompasses the on going transactions with qdi persons  we entered into a three year outsourcing agreement whereby the outside insurance brokerage company provides the administrative responsibilities for insurance related services offered to qdi persons 
we receive a percentage of certain commissions  underwriting profits  administrative and other defined revenues related to the outsourced administrative responsibilities for insurance related services 
we are retaining certain assets and liabilities of ppi including the reserves established on the uninsured policies identified during the investigation of irregularities at ppi 
additionally  on august   we sold our orange juice transportation operations 
on august   we sold certain assets  primarily tractors and trailers related to the glass transportation business of levy transport  ltd  for million 
we recorded a loss of million on the sale of these assets  as well as additional tax expense of million in the third quarter of 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we believe the following are the more critical accounting policies that impact the financial statements  some of which are based on management s best estimates available at the time of preparation 
actual future experience may differ from these estimates 
property and equipment property and equipment expenditures  including tractor and trailer rebuilds that extend the useful lives of such equipment  are capitalized and recorded at cost 
for financial statement purposes  these assets are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets to an estimated salvage value 
annual depreciable lives are years for buildings and improvements  years for tractors and trailers  years for terminal equipment  years for furniture and fixtures and years for other equipment 
tractor and trailer rebuilds  which are recurring in nature and extend the lives of the related assets  are capitalized and depreciated over the period of extension  generally to years  based on the type and extent of these rebuilds 
maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred 
management estimates the useful lives of these assets based on historical trends and the age of the assets when placed in service  and any changes in the actual lives could result in material changes in the net book value of these assets 
additionally  we estimate the salvage values of these assets based on historical sales of disposals  and any changes in the actual salvage values could also affect the net book value of these assets 
furthermore  we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in the business climate indicate that the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the related asset may be less than previously anticipated 
if the net book value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset  the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of its expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions in projecting future cash flows  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the amount of any write offs for impairment 
goodwill goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances indicate possible impairment 
we identified three reporting units transportation operations  insurance operations and mexican operations 
we allocated goodwill to the transportation operation as it principally resulted from the acquisition of clc in if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the goodwill within the reporting unit is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill 
we performed our annual assessment during the second quarter of we used a combination of discounted cash flows and valuation of our capital structure to estimate the fair value 
projections for future cash flows were based on our recent operating trends 
if actual cash flows turn out to be significantly less than projections  then the impairment analysis could change  possibly resulting in future impairment charges 
deferred tax assets we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
if  on the basis of available evidence  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  the asset must be reduced by a valuation allowance 
since realization is not assured as of december   management has deemed it appropriate to establish a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets 
any change in the actual future results of operations could impact the valuation of the net deferred tax asset 
environmental liabilities we have reserved for potential environmental liabilities based on the best estimates of potential clean up and remediation estimates for known environmental sites 
we employ a staff of environmental professionals to administer all phases of our environmental programs and use outside experts where needed 
these professionals develop estimates of potential liabilities at these sites based on projected and known remediation costs 
these cost projections are determined through previous experiences with other sites and through bids from third party contractors 
management believes current reserves are reasonable based on current information 
accident claims reserves we currently maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage claims  covering all employees  owner operators and affiliates  and workers compensation insurance coverage on our employees and company drivers 
this insurance includes deductibles of million per incident for property damage and million for workers compensation for periods after september  as such  we are subject to liability as a self insurer to the extent of these deductibles under the policy 
we are self insured for damage to the equipment we own or lease  for cargo losses  and for pollution legal liability 
in developing liability reserves  we rely on professional third party claims administrators  insurance company estimates and the judgment of our own safety department personnel  and independent professional actuaries and attorneys 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trends in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management believes reserves are reasonable given known information  but as each case develops  estimates may change to reflect the effect of new information 

table of contents revenue recognition transportation revenues  including fuel surcharges  and related costs are recognized on the date the freight is delivered 
other service revenues  consisting primarily of lease revenues from affiliates  owner operators and third parties  are recognized ratably over the lease period 
tank wash revenues are recognized when the wash is performed 
insurance brokerage revenues are recorded as a contractual percentage of premiums received ratably over the period that the insurance covers 
as a result of the irregularities at ppi  we have recognized all revenues  including the premiums for the insurance policies that were not renewed with third party insurance carriers in connection with the restatement at ppi  on a gross basis as the principal and primary obligor with risk of loss in relation to our responsibility for completion of services as contracted by our customers 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for all potentially uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
these factors are continuously monitored by our management to arrive at the estimate for the amount of accounts receivable that may be ultimately uncollectible 
the receivables analyzed include trade receivables  as well as loans and advances made to owner operators and affiliates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
historically  our actual losses have been consistent with these allowances 
pension plans we maintain two noncontributory defined benefit plans resulting from a prior acquisition that cover certain full time salaried employees and certain other employees under a collective bargaining agreement 
both plans are frozen and  as such  no future benefits accrue 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles  which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates and assumed rates of return 
material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plans and other factors 
the discount rate is based on a model portfolio of aa rated bonds with a maturity matched to the estimated payouts of future pension benefits 
the expected return on plan assets is based on our expectation of the long term rates of return on each asset class based on the current asset mix of the funds  considering the historical returns earned on the type of assets in the funds  plus an assumption of future inflation 
the current investment policy target asset allocation is equities and bonds  and the current inflation assumption is 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by gaap in the united states  the effects of the modifications are amortized over future periods 
based on the information provided by our independent actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable 
new accounting pronouncements on october   the american jobs creation act of was signed into law 
this legislation contains a number of changes to the internal revenue code that may affect us 
we are in the process of analyzing the law in order to determine its effects  if any  on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payments 
sfas no 
r would require the company to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will require additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas no 
r is effective beginning in the quarter ending september  the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to be comparable to the effect disclosed on a pro forma basis as a result of applying the current fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations during the second quarter of  we sold the levy petroleum trucking division and closed the levy mining trucking operation  as well as closed bulknet  our internet based load brokerage subsidiary

transportation revenue increased by million or compared to at the end of  we acquired the liquid tank business of one of our competitors  which provided million of additional revenue for since the end of  five new affiliates  representing ten terminals  joined us providing approximately million of revenues in however  one of these new affiliates  which generated million in revenue was associated with the orange juice business that was sold in additionally  the five affiliates that joined us during  generated million of incremental business in as compared with the remainder of the increase is attributable to stronger demand from existing customers  additional new business secured during the past twelve months and rate increases 
the revenue per mile change accounted for million of the transportation increase 
the increased demand from existing customers is a reflection of the gradual strengthening of the chemical industry as evidenced by a increase in revenue from generated by our ten largest customers 
other service revenue increased by million or in versus this increase was primarily due to a million increase in tractor  trailer and other rental revenues as a result of our converting company owned terminals to affiliates and a million increase in tank washing revenue 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in ppi revenues due to a decline in business volume after the irregularities were disclosed as well as the sale of certain ppi assets in july fuel surcharge revenue increased million or from as a result of higher fuel prices and volume increases 
we operated a total of  trailers and  tractors at the end of compared to  trailers and  tractors at december  the decrease in trailers is largely due to identifying trailers that are no longer being utilized by us and are being held for sale 
operating expenses  totaled million in  an increase of million or from the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher purchased transportation resulting from increased revenue and the impact of several conversions of company terminals to affiliates during and as terminals are converted  we reduce overhead expense as well as fuel  supplies and maintenance expense and increase purchased transportation expense  representing the affiliates percentage of revenues 
this also accounts for the reduction in fuel  supplies and maintenance expense 
additionally  million of start up costs and operating losses related to our recently divested orange juice transportation operations were included in purchased transportation 
compensation expense decreased million  or 
the reduction is primarily due to a decrease of million as a result of converting company owned terminals to affiliates and the sale of the levy glass division

insurance expense decreased million  or due to a million decrease in ppi expenses since including expenses in for the establishment of ppi reserves on uninsured claims as well as fines and penalties 
we reduced our exposure to self insurance losses related to ppi shortly after the discovery of the irregularities and disposed of the majority of the ppi assets and customer lists in july this decrease was offset in part by an increase in insurance expense of million recorded in the second quarter of resulting from adverse developments of insurance claims 
the million reserve for fines and penalties established in the fourth quarter of was reduced by million in the second quarter of and by million in the fourth quarter of due to the settlement with certain states and customers

other service revenue increased by million or in versus primarily due to an increase of million in trailer rental revenues as a result of our converting company owned terminals to affiliates 
fuel surcharge increased million from as a result of higher fuel prices and volume increases 
we operated a total of  trailers and  tractors at the end of compared to  trailers and  tractors at december  the increase in tractors is largely due to the addition of new affiliates who provided their own tractors 
the increase in trailers is also due to the addition of new affiliates that previously ran independently and  thus  already owned trailers and to the acquisition of new business that had been serviced by in house fleets where the customer provided its own trailers

as a direct result of these conversions  company drivers decreased from to  which caused a million decrease in driver compensation during fuel  supplies and maintenance decreased million  or  as company terminals were converted to affiliates  and these costs were assumed by the affiliates 
additionally  the number of company owned tractors decreased from at december  to at december   thereby reducing the maintenance expenses for which we are responsible 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  as we reduced the number of company owned tractors and as trailers acquired in the merger with clc became fully depreciated during

the remaining increase in our insurance claims expense of million is the result of higher insurance claims than in the previous year relating to our transportation business

discontinued operations accounted for a million loss in the discontinued operations consisted of the sale and disposal of the canadian petroleum and mining trucking divisions of levy  and the closure of bulknet  our internet based load brokerage subsidiary 
we incurred a million loss on the ultimate disposition of the operations  due largely to the write off of goodwill  sale of assets associated with the canadian petroleum and mining trucking divisions and write down of all software and development costs at bulknet

qd llc has the ability to incur additional debt  subject to limitations imposed by the credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes 
under the indentures governing the qd llc notes which includes the senior subordinated notes and the senior floating rate notes  in addition to specified permitted indebtedness qd llc will be able to incur additional indebtedness so long as on a pro forma basis qd llc s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the respective indentures for the qd llc notes to consolidated fixed charges is to or greater 
we believe that based on current operations and anticipated growth  our cash flow from operations  together with available sources of liquidity  including borrowings under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and make required payments of principal and interest on our debt  including obligations under our credit agreement and satisfy other long term contractual commitments for the next twelve months 
however  for periods extending beyond months  if our operating cash flow and borrowings under the revolving credit facility are not sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditures  debt service and other long term contractual commitments  we will be required to seek alternative financing 
these alternatives would likely include another restructuring or refinancing of our long term debt  the sale of a portion or all of our assets or operations or the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
if these alternatives are not available in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms  or are not permitted under our existing agreements  we may default on some or all of our obligations 
if we default on our obligations  including our financial covenants required to be maintained under the credit facility  and the debt under the indenture for the new notes were to be accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full all of our indebtedness  and we may be forced into bankruptcy 
other issues we have historically sought to acquire smaller local operators as part of our program of strategic growth 
we continue to evaluate potential accretive acquisitions in order to capitalize on the consolidation occurring in the industry and expect to fund such acquisitions from available sources of liquidity  including borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
management does not expect to incur any additional expenses in connection with the irregularities discovered at ppi discussed in the explanatory note in the introduction to this report that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity during while uncertainties relating to environmental  labor and regulatory matters exist within the trucking industry  management is not aware of any trends or events  other than ppi  likely to have a material adverse effect on liquidity or the accompanying financial statements 
our credit rating is affected by many factors  including our financial results  operating cash flows and total indebtedness 
as a holding company with no significant assets other than ownership of of qd llc s membership units  we also depend upon qd llc s cash flows to service our debt 
qd llc s ability to make distributions to us is restricted by the covenants contained in the credit facility and the indentures governing the qd llc notes 
however  apollo as our controlling stockholder  may have an interest in pursuing reorganizations  restructurings or other transactions involving us that  in their 
table of contents judgment  could enhance their equity investment even though those transactions might involve increasing qd llc s leverage or impairing qd llc s creditworthiness in order to decrease qdi s leverage 
while the restrictions in the indenture governing the qd llc notes cover a wide variety of arrangements that have traditionally been used to effect highly leveraged transactions  the indentures governing the qd llc notes may not afford the holders of the notes protection in all circumstances from the adverse aspects of a highly leveraged transaction  reorganization  restructuring  merger or similar transaction 
although qdi has no current intention to engage in these types of transactions  there can be no assurance it will not do so in the future if permitted under the terms of the credit facility and the indentures governing the qd llc notes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk from time to time  we utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the instruments primarily used to mitigate these risks are interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contacts 
all derivative instruments held by us are designated as hedges  and  accordingly  the gains and losses from changes in derivative fair values are recognized as comprehensive income as required by sfas gains and losses upon settlement are recognized in the statement of operations or recorded as part of the underlying asset or liability as appropriate 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these financial instruments  however  counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions  and the risk of loss due to nonperformance is considered by management to be minimal 
we do not hold or issue interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
we had approximately million of variable interest debt outstanding at december  we entered into interest rate swap agreements designated as a partial hedge of our portfolio of variable rate debt during the purpose of these swaps is to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuation 
as of december  and  there were no outstanding interest rate swaps 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our variable rate borrowings under qd llc s credit facility 
interest rates for the revolving credit facility are based  at qd llc s option  on either the administrative agent s base rate plus or upon the eurodollar rate plus  and interest rates for the term loan are based  at qd llc s option  upon the administrative agent s base rate plus or upon the eurodollar rate plus  in each case subject to reductions in the applicable margins for the revolving credit facility and term loan only if we reduce our total consolidated leverage below certain levels

foreign currency exchange rate risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may impact future earnings and or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations canada and mexico represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and of our consolidated revenue in the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect of these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
while we may hedge specific transaction risks  we generally do not hedge translation risks because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
at december   we had no outstanding forward contracts or option contracts to buy or sell foreign currency 
for the three year period ended december   there were no gains or losses included in our consolidated statements of operations on forward contracts and option contracts 
assets and liabilities for our canadian operations are matched in the local currency  which reduces the need for dollar conversion 
our mexican operations use the united states dollar as their functional currency 
any foreign currency impact on translating assets and liabilities into dollars is included as a component of shareholders equity 
our revenue results for fiscal year were positively impacted by a million foreign currency movement  primarily due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profits for related to the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we estimate that a adverse change in the canadian dollar foreign exchange rate would have decreased our revenues by approximately million in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
as discussed above  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  global politics and other market factors 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can be unpredictable as well as the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations
