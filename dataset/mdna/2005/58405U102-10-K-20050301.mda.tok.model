fiscal years  and each consist of weeks 
unless otherwise stated  references to years in the consolidated financial statements relate to fiscal years 
principles of consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all of its subsidiaries

see note  debt  for additional information 
accounts receivable  net 
accounts receivable  net  includes billed and estimated unbilled receivables from manufacturers and clients 
in addition  rebates payable to clients are estimated and accrued as a reduction in accounts receivable  net  based upon the prescription drugs dispensed by the pharmacies in the company s retail networks  or dispensed by the company s mail order pharmacies 
when rebates due to be passed back to clients are greater than the corresponding client accounts receivable balances  the net liability is reclassified to claims and other accounts payable 
unbilled receivables from manufacturers are generally billed beginning days from the end of each quarter 
unbilled receivables from clients are typically billed within days based on the contractual billing schedule agreed upon with each client 
at the end of any given reporting period  unbilled receivables from clients can represent up to two weeks of dispensing activity and will fluctuate at the end of a fiscal month depending on the timing of these billing cycles 
as of december  and december   respectively  unbilled receivables from clients and manufacturers amounted to  million and  million 
accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
inventories  net 
inventories  net  are located in the company s mail order pharmacies and warehouses  consist solely of finished product primarily prescription drugs  and are valued at the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
property and equipment  net 
property and equipment  net  is stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method for assets with useful lives ranging from three to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining life of the lease or the useful lives of the assets 
the company complies with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over three to five years 
costs for general and administrative expenses  overhead  maintenance and training  as well as the cost of software coding that does not add functionality to the existing system  are expensed as incurred 
property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when such events occur  the company compares the carrying amount of the assets to undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings 
if this comparison indicates that there is an impairment  the amount of the impairment would be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
net revenues 
product net revenues consist principally of sales of prescription drugs to clients  either through the company s network of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or through the company s mail order pharmacies  and are recognized when those prescriptions are dispensed and received by the clients members 
the company evaluates client contracts using the indicators of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting gross revenue as a principal vs 
net as an agent  to determine whether the company acts as a principal or as an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through the retail pharmacy network 
the company acts as a principal in most of its transactions with clients and revenues are recognized at the prescription price ingredient cost plus dispensing fee negotiated with clients  including the portion of the price allocated by the client to be settled directly by the member co payment  as well as the company s administrative fees gross reporting 
gross reporting is appropriate because the company a has separate contractual relationships with clients and with pharmacies  b is responsible to validate and economically manage a claim through its claims adjudication process  c commits to set prescription prices for the pharmacy  including instructing the pharmacy as to how that price is to be settled co payment requirements  d manages the overall prescription drug relationship with the patients  who are members of clients plans  and e has credit risk for the price due from the client 
in limited instances where the company adjudicates prescriptions at pharmacies that are under contract directly with the client and there are no financial risks to the company  such revenue is recorded at the amount of the administrative fee earned by the company for processing the claim net reporting 
rebates  guarantees  and risk sharing payments paid to clients and other discounts are deducted from product net revenue as they are earned by the client 
rebates are generally paid to clients subsequent to collections from pharmaceutical manufacturers  although there are certain instances where rebates are paid to clients on a more accelerated basis 
other contractual payments made to clients are generally made upon initiation of contracts as implementation allowances  which may  for example  be designated by clients as funding for their costs to transition their plans to the company or as compensation for certain information or licensing rights granted by the client to the company 
the company considers these payments to be an integral part of the company s pricing of a contract and believes that they represent only a variability in the timing of cash flows that does not change the underlying economics of the contract 
accordingly  these payments are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of product net revenue  generally on a straight line basis  over the life of the contract where the payments are refundable upon cancellation of the contract or relate to noncancelable contracts 
amounts capitalized are assessed periodically for recoverability based on the profitability of the contract 
in each of and  the company had one client that represented of net revenues 
this client represented of net revenues in service revenues consist principally of sales of prescription services to pharmaceutical manufacturers and other parties  and administrative fees earned from clients and other non product related revenues 
client administrative fees are earned for services that are comprised of claims processing  eligibility management  benefits management  pharmacy network management and other related customer services 
service revenues are recorded by the company when performance occurs and collectibility is assured 
cost of revenues 
cost of product net revenues includes the cost of inventory dispensed from the mail order pharmacies  costs incurred in the mail order front end prescription order processing pharmacies and back end prescription dispensing pharmacies  along with associated depreciation 
cost of product net revenues also includes ingredient costs of drugs dispensed by and professional fees paid to retail network pharmacies 
in addition  cost of product net revenues includes the operating costs of the company s call center pharmacies  which primarily respond to member and retail pharmacist inquiries regarding member prescriptions  as well as physician calls 
cost of product net revenues also includes an offsetting credit for rebates earned from pharmaceutical manufacturers whose drugs are included on the company s preferred drug lists  which are also known as formularies 
these rebates generally take the form of formulary rebates  which are earned based on the volume of a specific drug dispensed under formularies  and market share rebates  which are based on the achievement of contractually specified market share levels for a specific drug 
rebates receivable from pharmaceutical manufacturers are accrued in the period earned by multiplying estimated rebatable prescription drugs dispensed through the company s retail network and through the company s mail order pharmacies by the contractually agreed manufacturer rebate amount 
rebates receivable estimates are revised to actual  with the difference recorded to cost of revenues  upon billing to the manufacturer  generally to days subsequent to the end of the applicable quarter 
these billings are not issued until the necessary specific eligible claims and third party market share data is received and thoroughly analyzed 
historically  the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized and recorded to actual amounts billed has not been material to the company s results of operations 
cost of service revenues consists principally of labor and operating costs for delivery of services provided  costs associated with member communication materials  and certain information acquisition costs 
goodwill  net 
goodwill  net  of  million at december  and december   net of accumulated amortization of million through december  primarily represents the push down of the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the company s net assets from the acquisition of the company by merck in and  to a significantly lesser extent  the company s acquisition of provantage health services  inc in the company tests its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or whenever events  such as a protracted decline in the company s stock price or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  using a two step fair value based test 
the most recent assessment of goodwill impairment was performed as of december   and the recorded goodwill was determined not to be impaired 
intangible assets  net 
intangible assets  net  primarily reflect the value of client relationships of  million at december  and  million at december   net of accumulated amortization of  million at december  and million at december  that arose in connection with the acquisition of the company by merck in and that have been pushed down to the consolidated balance sheets of the company 
these intangible assets are recorded at cost and are reviewed for impairment whenever events  such as losses of significant clients  or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when these events occur  the carrying amount of the assets is compared to the pre tax undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings 
if this comparison indicates that there is an impairment  the amount of the impairment would be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
the company continually assesses the useful lives of the intangible assets  taking into account historical client turnover experience  including recent losses of clients and expected future losses  to ensure they reflect current circumstances 
until december   the intangible asset from the merck acquisition was being amortized over a weighted average useful life of years 
effective as of the beginning of fiscal year  the weighted average useful life of the intangible asset was revised to years  with the annual intangible asset amortization expense increasing by million compared to effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year  the weighted average useful life was revised from years to years  with the annual intangible asset amortization expense increasing to million from million in stock based compensation 
prior to the spin off from merck  the company s employees had participated in merck stock option plans under which employees were granted options to purchase shares of merck common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant 
these options generally were exercisable in three to five years and expired within five to years from the date of grant 
certain merck stock options granted in and converted to medco options upon the spin off the converted options 
the rate of conversion was determined based on a formula that preserved the economic position of the option holder immediately before and after the spin off 
subsequent to the spin off  the company granted medco options to employees to purchase shares of medco common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant 
under the terms of the medco health solutions  inc stock incentive plan  as of december   million shares of the company s common stock are available for awards under the plan 
the company accounts for employee options to purchase stock  and for employee participation in the medco health solutions  inc  employee stock purchase plan espp and the medco health solutions  inc  employee stock purchase plan espp  under the intrinsic value method of expense recognition in accounting principles board apb no

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
see recent accounting pronouncements below for a discussion of sfas no 
revised  share based payment statement r which revises sfas no 
and supersedes apb  and its related implementation guidance 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense is the amount by which the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of an option on the date of grant 
employee stock options are granted to purchase shares of stock at the fair market value on the date of grant 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized in the company s consolidated statements of income for any stock options  the espp or the espp 
if the fair value method of accounting for the medco options  merck options  espp and the espp had been applied  net income in  and would have been reduced 
the fair value method requires recognition of compensation expense ratably over the vesting period 
prior to december   pro forma compensation expense utilizing the fair value method of accounting for the company s stock options had been calculated using the black scholes model based on a single option valuation approach using the straight line method of amortization 
in january  the company revised the assumptions utilized by the black scholes model in determining pro forma compensation expense  based on updated option exercise data  such that the expense is determined using separate expected term assumptions for each vesting tranche  with the expense attributed under the method prescribed in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans fin 
as a result  beginning in january  the company has calculated pro forma compensation expense for any stock options granted since that time using the fin methodology 
for the year ended december   this change in methodology resulted in an increase of million  net of tax  in the pro forma compensation expense over the amount calculated had the single option value straight line method of amortization been utilized 
the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value method for recognizing employee stock based compensation to the medco options  merck options  espp and espp is as follows in millions  except for per share data fiscal years net income  as reported medco stock based compensation expense  net of tax pro forma net income including medco stock based compensation expense merck stock based compensation expense  net of tax pro forma net income including all stock based compensation expense basic earnings per share as reported pro forma diluted earnings per share as reported pro forma notes subsequent to the spin off in august  the company granted  restricted stock units to key employees and directors 
these restricted stock units generally vest over two or three years 
additionally  in april  the company granted  restricted stock units to directors  which vest over one year 
the company recorded unearned compensation within stockholders equity at an amount equivalent to the market value on the date of grant of million in and million in  and is amortizing such amount to compensation expense over the vesting period 
net income  as reported  includes stock based compensation expense related to the restricted stock units for the year ended december  of million million pre tax 
for the year ended december   compensation expense related to the restricted stock units was million million pre tax 
at december   the net unearned compensation recorded within stockholders equity is million 
for the year ended december   the medco pro forma stock based compensation expense  determined using the fair value method for stock based awards  net of tax  includes million million pre tax for the medco options  million million pre tax for the converted options  as well as million million pre tax for the espp 
prior to the spin off  the converted options were valued with option assumptions applicable to merck and upon spin off were re valued using the sfas fair value method assumptions applicable to medco 
the resulting increase in the fair values of the converted options is recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period of the option grant 
the company is reflecting the merck stock based compensation for its employees in the pro forma net income for the periods the company was wholly owned by merck 
upon spin off from merck  the company s employees had no remaining service requirements to merck and the merck stock options became fully vested  with the compensation expense of million reflecting the accelerated vesting 
there has been no impact on the company s post spin off pro forma earnings  nor will there be any impact on future pro forma earnings relating to the merck options 
the fair value was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model based on the weighted average market price on the grant date and weighted average assumptions specific to the underlying options 
the medco volatility assumption is based on the volatility of the largest competitors within the pbm industry combined with the company s stock price volatility for the period the company has been publicly traded 
the historical merck assumptions relate to merck stock and were therefore based on merck s valuation assumptions 
the assumptions utilized for option grants during the years presented are as follows fiscal years medco stock options black scholes assumptions weighted average expected dividend yield n a risk free interest rate n a expected volatility n a expected life years n a merck stock options black scholes assumptions weighted average expected dividend yield n a risk free interest rate n a expected volatility n a expected life years n a not applicable 
see note  stock based compensation  for additional information concerning the company s stock based compensation plans 
business transactions with merck during the merck ownership period 
the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of merck from november  through august   and entered into intercompany transactions with merck as further discussed in note the net amount due from merck as of december  was classified as equity and formed a part of the continuing equity of the company 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
prior to the date of its incorporation  the company was structured as a single member limited liability company with merck as the sole member 
as described further in note  taxes on income  under the terms of the tax responsibility allocation agreement  the company is responsible for the payment of federal income taxes and all state income taxes on income earned subsequent to the date of the spin off  except that the company is also generally responsible for state income taxes on income earned subsequent to the date of incorporation in states where merck did not file a unitary or combined return 
these federal and state income tax liabilities are reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
merck is responsible for the payment of federal and state income taxes on income earned prior to the aforementioned transition dates 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
use of estimates 
the consolidated financial statements include certain amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments 
estimates are used in determining such items as accruals for rebates receivable and payable  depreciable useful lives  testing for impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions  amounts recorded for contingencies  and other reserves 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
operating segments 
the company conducts and reports its operations as a single operating segment  which primarily consists of sales of prescription drugs to clients either through the company s networks of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or through its mail order pharmacies  and in one geographic region the united states and puerto rico 
management reviews the operating and financial results on a consolidated basis 
pbm services to clients are delivered and managed under a single contract for each client 
earnings per share 
the company reports earnings per share eps in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share sfas 
basic eps are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding during the reporting period 
diluted eps are calculated to give effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the reporting period 
the dilutive effect of outstanding options  and their equivalents  is reflected in diluted eps by application of the treasury stock method 
from february  to june   merck granted under its employee stock options plans  options that converted into million medco options on august  the rate of conversion was determined based on a formula that preserved the economic position of the option holder immediately before and after the spin off 
for purposes of calculating fiscal year diluted eps  the converted options were assumed to have converted to medco options on their original date of grant 
subsequent to the spin off in august  the company granted options of million shares in fiscal and million shares in fiscal at the fair market value on the date of grant 
these options may have a dilutive effect on future eps if the exercise price of the options is less than the market price during a future reporting period 
options granted by merck to medco employees prior to february  remain options to purchase merck stock and became fully vested upon the spin off 
these merck options have no impact on medco share dilution 
for the year ended december   there were outstanding options to purchase million shares of medco stock where the exercise price of the options exceeded the average stock price  which is calculated as the average of the nyse price for each trading day in the fiscal period 
accordingly  these options are excluded from the diluted eps calculation 
the following is a reconciliation of the number of weighted average shares used in the basic and diluted eps calculation amounts in millions fiscal years weighted average shares outstanding dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding stock options and restricted stock units weighted average shares outstanding assuming dilution other comprehensive income loss 
total comprehensive income includes  in addition to net income  unrealized investment gains and losses and changes in the minimum pension liability excluded from the consolidated statements of income that were recorded directly into a separate section of stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets 
these items are referred to as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is based on assumptions used by actuaries for discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
see note  pension and other postretirement benefits  for more information concerning the company s pension and other postretirement benefits assumptions 
contingencies 
the company is currently involved in various legal proceedings and other disputes with third parties that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
the company has considered these proceedings and disputes in determining the necessity of any reserves for losses that are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the company s recorded reserves are based on estimates developed with consideration given to the potential merits of claims  the range of possible settlements  advice from outside counsel  and management s strategy with regard to the settlement of such claims or defense against such claims 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in january  the fasb issued staff position fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  or fsp fas 
fsp fas allows for current recognition or a one time deferral of the effects of the act 
the deferral suspends the application of sfas no

in may  the fasb issued staff position fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  or fsp fas  which supercedes fsp fas and provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the act and requires employers that sponsor postretirement healthcare plans that provide prescription drug benefits to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy included in the act 
fsp fas was effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  and the company has elected to take the one time deferral  the impact of which is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement r which revises sfas and supersedes apb and its related implementation guidance

the company s pension plan asset allocation at december   december  and target allocation for by asset category are as follows target allocation percentage of plan assets at asset category december  december  us equity securities international equity securities fixed income instruments real estate cash and other total the investment objectives of the company s qualified pension plan are designed to generate asset returns that will enable the plan to meet its future benefit obligations 
the precise amount for which these obligations will be settled depends on future events  including interest rates  salary increases  and the life expectancy of the plan s members 
the obligations are estimated using actuarial assumptions  based on the current economic environment 
the pension plan seeks to achieve total returns both sufficient to meet expected future obligations  as well as returns greater than its policy benchmark reflecting the target weights of the asset classes used in its targeted strategic asset allocation 
the plan s targeted strategic allocation to each asset class was determined through an asset liability modeling study 
the currently adopted strategic asset allocation targets percent in equity securities and percent in fixed income and diversification within specific asset classes of these broad categories

the projected benefit obligation amounts are higher because they include projected future salary increases through expected retirement 
unrecognized net loss gain amounts reflect experience differentials relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets  differences between expected and actual healthcare cost increases  and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions 
expected returns are based on the market value of assets 
total unrecognized net loss gain amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net pension and other postretirement benefit costs over the average remaining service life of employees 
actuarial assumptions 
actuarial weighted average assumptions used in determining plan information are as follows pension benefits other postretirement benefits fiscal years weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate salary growth rate weighted average assumptions used to determine net cost discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets salary growth rate the company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis 
for  the company changed its expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to for pension benefits  and its discount rates for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits from to 
the expected rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on the plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
in developing the expected rate of return  the company considers long term compound annualized returns of historical market data  as well as historical actual returns on the company s plan assets 
using this reference information  the company develops forward looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted average expected long term rate of return for a targeted portfolio allocated across these investment categories 
actuarial assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment 
a reasonably possible change of plus minus basis points in the discount rate assumption  with other assumptions held constant  would have an estimated million favorable unfavorable impact on net pension and postretirement benefit cost 
a reasonably possible change of plus minus basis points in the expected rate of return assumption  with other assumptions held constant  would have an estimated million favorable unfavorable impact on net pension cost 
since future costs for the postretirement benefit healthcare plan were capped based on costs  employer liability is not affected by healthcare cost trend after the company does not expect to have a minimum pension funding requirement under the internal revenue code irc during the preceding hypothetical changes in discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would not impact the company s funding requirements 
cash flows employer contributions 
the company expects to contribute up to million to its pension plans in the expected contributions to the pension plans during are estimated to reflect amounts necessary to satisfy minimum funding requirements or reflect medco s discretion in bringing the plans to a fully funded accumulated benefit obligation status

the study included formalization during the second quarter of its state income tax position through rulings from and discussions with taxing authorities in key selected states 
as a result of the outcome of the study  the company has determined that its income taxes as a stand alone taxpayer should be provided at a lower effective rate than the rate it used as a member of the merck consolidated group 
for all periods presented  the company s consolidated balance sheets reflect a net deferred tax liability  which arises from its deferred tax liabilities  principally on its intangible assets being only partially offset by its deferred tax assets  principally on client rebates payable and other accruals 
accordingly  a reduction in the company s effective tax rate results in a benefit from the reduction of that net deferred tax liability 
this net deferred tax liability was originally recorded on the company s consolidated financial statements through an intercompany transaction with merck that became part of the company s additional paid in capital 
as a result of the study  the company expects to settle its net deferred tax liability as a stand alone taxpayer at an effective rate lower than it expected to settle as a member of the merck consolidated group 
accordingly  the company in the second quarter of reduced its net deferred tax liability existing as of the spin off date  and recorded the benefit as a million credit to additional paid in capital 
the company also adjusted its net deferred tax liability in the second quarter of for temporary differences arising since the spin off through income tax expense  the impact of which was not material

general 
the company entered into an indemnification and insurance matters agreement with merck in connection with the spin off 
to the extent that the company is required to indemnify merck for liabilities arising out of a lawsuit  an adverse outcome with respect to merck could result in the company making indemnification payments in amounts that could be material  in addition to any damages that the company is required to pay 
the company is also involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to the company s business  principally employment and commercial matters 
the various lawsuits described above arise in an environment of rising costs for prescription drugs and heightened public scrutiny of the pharmaceutical industry  including the pbm industry and its practices 
this public scrutiny is characterized by extensive press coverage  ongoing attention in congress and in state legislatures  and investigations and public statements by government officials 
these factors contribute to the uncertainty regarding the possible course and outcome of the proceedings discussed above 
an adverse outcome in any one of the lawsuits described above could result in material fines and damages  changes to the company s business practices except in those proceedings where non monetary issues have been settled  loss of or litigation with clients  and other penalties 
moreover  an adverse outcome in any one of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  liquidity and operating results 
the company is vigorously defending each of the lawsuits described above  except that it has proposed to settle  or has settled  some of them as described above 
although the range of loss for all of the unresolved matters above is not subject to reasonable estimation and it is not feasible to predict or determine the final outcome of any of the above proceedings with certainty  the company s management does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or liquidity  either individually or in the aggregate 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by the ultimate resolutions of these matters  or changes in the company s assumptions or its strategies related to these proceedings 
the company believes that most of the claims made in these legal proceedings and government investigations would not likely be covered by insurance

the proposed amendment seeks injunctive relief to enjoin the acquisition on the grounds that the named accredo directors and officers allegedly seek to use the acquisition to squeeze out accredo s current stockholders for an unfair price and to insulate themselves from liability for alleged wrongdoing associated with accredo s june acquisition of the sps division of gentiva health services  inc the company has been advised by accredo that it believes the claims asserted in the derivative lawsuit are without merit
