overview cv therapeutics  inc  headquartered in palo alto  california  is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of new small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases 
we apply advances in molecular biology and genetics to identify mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases and targets for drug discovery 
we have four clinical development drug candidates  including our lead drug candidate ranexa ranolazine for the potential treatment of chronic angina  which is subject to an approvable letter from the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
we also have several preclinical programs whose objectives are to bring additional drug candidates into human clinical testing 
in addition  we have entered into an agreement to co promote aceon perindopril erbumine tablets  an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor  or ace inhibitor  with our partner solvay pharmaceuticals  inc in the united states 
in december  the company signed a co promotion agreement with solvay pharmaceuticals to co promote aceon in the united states 
aceon is an ace inhibitor with tissue activity approved in the united states for the treatment of hypertension 
also in december  solvay pharmaceuticals submitted a supplemental new drug application  or snda  for aceon to the fda seeking approval to market the product under a proposed label expansion 
the fda has granted priority review for the snda  with a regulatory action date in june the proposed label expansion is based on the europa european trial on reduction of cardiac events with perindopril in patients with stable coronary artery disease study which assessed the ability of perindopril to reduce cardiovascular death  nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest in a broad population of patients who had stable coronary artery disease but not heart failure or substantial hypertension 
in the europa study  perindopril significantly reduced relative cardiovascular risk by as assessed by the primary combined study endpoint of cardiovascular death  non fatal myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest 
we are developing our lead drug candidate  ranexa  for the potential treatment of chronic angina 
unlike current anti anginal drug therapies  ranexa appears to exert its anti anginal activity without depending on reductions in heart rate or blood pressure 
if approved by the fda  ranexa would represent the first new class of anti anginal therapy in the united states in more than years 
in october  the fda sent us an approvable letter indicating that ranexa is approvable  that there is evidence that ranexa is an effective anti anginal  and that additional clinical information is needed prior to approval 
in june  we reached written agreement with the fda on a protocol for a clinical trial of ranexa which  if successful  could support the approval of ranexa for the treatment of chronic angina in a restricted patient population 
this agreement was reached under the fda s special protocol assessment  or spa  process 
we initiated this potentially approval enabling study  called the evaluation of ranolazine in chronic angina  or erica  in august and completed patient enrollment in 
table of contents november initial data from the erica study are expected in the second quarter of if the study is successful  we would expect to submit an amendment to our new drug application for ranexa in the second half of  seeking product approval from the fda in a restricted patient population 
in order to potentially broaden the product labeling for ranexa  if any  over time  we also reached written agreement with the fda in august on a separate spa agreement for a study of ranexa which could support potential approval of ranexa as first line therapy for patients suffering from chronic angina 
in order to obtain potential approval as first line angina therapy  under the spa we also need to perform a separate successful clinical evaluation of higher doses of ranexa 
the study  if positive  also could result in the approval of ranexa for the treatment and long term prevention of acute coronary syndromes 
the study  known as metabolic efficiency with ranolazine for less ischemia in non st elevation acute coronary syndromes  or merlin timi  began enrollment in october and is being conducted by the harvard based timi study group 
in march  we filed a marketing authorization application  or maa  with the european medicines agency seeking approval of ranolazine for the treatment of chronic angina 
the maa was filed for review under the european regulatory authorities centralized procedure by our european subsidiary  cv therapeutics europe limited 
another one of our late stage compounds is regadenoson  a selective a 
a 
adenosine receptor agonist for potential use as a pharmacologic agent in myocardial perfusion imaging studies 
we initiated a second double blind phase iii clinical trial of regadenoson in april data from one phase iii trial are expected in the third quarter of  and data from the other phase iii trial are expected by the end of tecadenoson is a selective a adenosine receptor agonist for the potential reduction of rapid heart rate during atrial arrhythmias 
adentri is a selective a adenosine receptor antagonist for the potential treatment of congestive heart failure  and has been licensed to biogen inc now biogen idec inc 
in addition  we have several on going research and preclinical development programs whose objectives are to bring additional drug candidates into human clinical testing 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory approvals  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition  use of hazardous materials and retention of key employees 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us and  in some cases  our collaborators  to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies presently involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements valuation of marketable securities we invest our excess cash balances primarily in short term and long term marketable debt securities for use in current operations 
accordingly  we have classified all investments as short term  even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses are included in interest and other income  net 
estimated fair value is based upon quoted market prices for these or similar instruments 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue under our collaborative research arrangement is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract 
amounts received under such arrangements consist of up front license  periodic milestone payments and reimbursements for research activities 
up front or milestone payments which are still subject to future performance requirements are recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized over the performance period 
the performance period is estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is reevaluated at each reporting period 
the reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the appropriate period based on research progress attained and events such as changes in the regulatory and competitive environment 
revenues related to substantive  at risk milestones are recognized upon achievement of the scientific or regulatory event specified in the underlying agreement 
revenues for research activities are recognized as the related research efforts are performed 
research and development expenses and accruals research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contract services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials  manufacturing and process development  research and other consulting activities  costs are expensed upon the earlier of when non refundable amounts are due or as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful accrual of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our consolidated financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
stock option valuation the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including estimates of future stock price volatility 
changes to the subjective input assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our stock options 
we are currently evaluating our option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of a new accounting standard related to employee stock options 
results of operations years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
collaborative research revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to greater reimbursable development costs associated with two phase iii clinical trials undertaken in our collaboration with fujisawa healthcare  inc for the development of regadenoson 

table of contents we do not expect any significant increase in revenues in and expect that any significant increase in revenues for the next several years after will be dependent upon the successful regulatory approval of the aceon supplemental new drug application and the ranexa new drug application and then the successful commercialization of aceon and ranexa  if approved  or any other products 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased outside contract service expenses for two phase iii ranexa studies and two phase iii regadenoson studies as well as the expense associated with accruing a milestone plus million in associated interest due under our license agreement with syntex usa inc now roche palo alto llc for ranexa 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in the future as we continue the merlin timi study 
management categorizes its research and development expenses by project 
the table below shows research and development expenses for our two primary clinical development programs  ranexa and regadenoson  as well as expenses associated with all other projects in our research and development pipeline 
other projects consist primarily of numerous pre clinical research projects  none of which individually constitutes more than of our total research and development expenses for the periods presented 
year ended december  in thousands ranexa regadenoson other projects total research and development sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decreased marketing planning and communications activities for ranexa  and a non cash expense recorded in of approximately million related to a warrant issued to quintiles transnational corp 
upon modification of our commercialization agreement  partially offset by increased personnel expenses associated with pre commercialization activities 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to significantly increase as we start to co promote aceon in the united states in and as we prepare to launch ranexa  if approved  or any other products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to additional personnel and related expenses to support our pre commercialization and research and development efforts 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future in line with our commercialization activities 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to losses recognized on sales of marketable securities in the year ended december   compared to gains recognized on sales of marketable securities in the year ended december  we expect that interest and other income  net will fluctuate in the future with average investment balances and market interest rates and with gains or losses recognized on the sale of marketable securities 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the write off of million of debt issuance costs from the repurchase of approximately million of our previously issued 
table of contents subordinated convertible notes due and the amortization of debt issuance costs and interest associated with the june issuance of our senior subordinated convertible debentures 
our subordinated convertible notes accounted for million and million of the interest expense in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our senior subordinated convertible debentures accounted for million and million of interest expense in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our senior subordinated convertible notes accounted for million of interest expense in the year ended december  we expect that interest and other expense will fluctuate in the future with average loan balances 
other expense  net 
other expense  net increased to million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to million in premium payments above the principal value incurred from the repurchase of approximately million of our previously issued convertible subordinated notes due taxes 
we have not generated taxable income to date 
as of december   the net operating losses potentially available to offset future taxable income for federal and california income tax purposes were approximately million and million  respectively 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards will likely be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the federal carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the california carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the federal research tax credits will expire at various dates beginning in the year  if not utilized 
as a result of annual limitations  a portion of these carryforwards and research tax credits will likely expire before becoming available to reduce our federal and california income tax liabilities 
years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
collaborative research revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million milestone payment from fujisawa recognized in october  earned in conjunction with the initiation of a pivotal phase iii trial of regadenoson  and increased reimbursable development costs related to our collaboration with fujisawa for the development of regadenoson 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decreased development and manufacturing expenses associated with ranexa and decreased clinical trial expenses associated with tecadenoson  which was offset by increased development expenses associated with regadenoson 
management categorizes its research and development expenses by project 
the table below shows research and development expenses for our two primary clinical development programs  ranexa and regadenoson  as well as expenses associated with all other projects in our research and development pipeline 
other projects consist primarily of numerous pre clinical research projects  none of which individually constitutes more than of our total research and development expenses for the periods presented  except in the year ended december   other projects include tecadenoson development expenses of million or of total research and development expense 
year ended december  in thousands ranexa regadenoson other projects total research and development 
table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses of million in preparation for potential ranexa approval  and a non cash expense of approximately million associated with the warrant issued to quintiles to purchase  shares of our common stock in conjunction with modifying our commercialization agreement with quintiles in the warrant was valued using the black scholes model assuming a term of five years  a risk free interest rate of and volatility of 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to fees paid in connection with outside consulting services and additional personnel and facility expenses to support our increased research  development and pre commercialization efforts 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates on our investments 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to amortization of debt issuance costs and interest associated with the june issuance of our senior subordinated convertible debentures 
our subordinated convertible notes accounted for million of the interest expense in each of these years 
our senior subordinated convertible debentures accounted for million of the interest expense in the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  statement r which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july   the beginning of our third quarter 
statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt statement r using the modified prospective method 

table of contents as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb no 
opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our consolidated result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and the valuation model we ultimately select 
we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of statement r related to employee stock options 
current estimates of option values using the black scholes method may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies we ultimately adopt 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public offerings of debt and equity securities  equipment and leasehold improvement financing  other debt financing and payments under corporate collaborations 
we currently estimate that our total net loss for the first half of will be approximately million to million 
for at least the next months  we expect to be able to fund our operations from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available as of december  as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to million at december  net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   and resulted primarily from operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in other assets  accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  and deferred revenue 
net cash provided by investing activities of million in the year ended december  consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of million largely offset by purchases of marketable securities of million and capital expenditures and other investing activities of million 
marketable securities decreased by million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december  was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the issuance of senior subordinated convertible notes  million from the sale of  shares of common stock under our financing agreement with acqua wellington and net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of common stock under the common stock purchase agreement with mainfield enterprises  inc  partially offset by the repurchase of approximately million principal amount of our senior subordinated convertible notes 
in january  we issued  shares of common stock under our financing agreement with acqua wellington for net proceeds of approximately million 
for the year ended december   we invested million in property and equipment 
we expect to continue to make investments in property and equipment to support our growth 
debt financing in march  we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due march  the notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt  as defined in the indenture governing the notes 
interest on the notes accrues at a rate of per year  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
we pay interest semi annually on march and september of each year 
the initial conversion rate  which is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  is shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
this is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share 
we may  at our option  redeem all or a portion of the notes at any time at pre determined prices from to of the face value of the notes per  of principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
in may and june  we repurchased approximately million of these outstanding notes due in connection with the repurchases we 
table of contents recorded a loss of approximately million for the early extinguishment of debt  which included million in unamortized offering costs included in interest expense and million in premium payments above the principal value of the notes included in other expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

the notes are convertible at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
we may redeem some or all of the notes for cash at any time on or after may  at pre determined prices  together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
we have filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission for the resale of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
we have agreed to keep the shelf registration statement effective until june  if we do not comply with these registration obligations  we will be required to pay liquidated damages to the holders of the notes or the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
we may from time to time seek to retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
alternatively  we may from time to time seek to restructure our outstanding debt through exchanges for new debt securities in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise

equity lines of credit in august  we entered into a financing arrangement with acqua wellington to purchase our common stock 
as of april   we and acqua wellington mutually agreed to terminate the financing arrangement in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement 
under the purchase agreement  as amended  we had the ability to sell up to million of our common stock to acqua wellington through december applicable nasdaq national market rules limited the number of shares of common stock that we could issue under our purchase agreement with acqua wellington to approximately  shares 
since we effectively reached the nasdaq limit  as of april   the purchase agreement was terminated in accordance with its 
table of contents terms 
we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock in exchange for aggregate net cash proceeds of million under this arrangement 
in july  we entered into a second financing arrangement with acqua wellington to purchase our common stock 
under the second purchase agreement  we had the ability to sell up to million of our common stock  or  shares of our common stock  whichever occurred first  to acqua wellington through november in january  the purchase agreement with acqua wellington automatically terminated when we reached the million limit of this financing arrangement 
the purchase agreement provided that from time to time  in our sole discretion  we could present acqua wellington with draw down notices constituting offers to sell our common stock for specified total proceeds over a specified trading period 
once presented with a draw down notice  acqua wellington was required to purchase a pro rata portion of shares of our common stock as allocated on each trading day during the trading period on which the daily volume weighted average price for our common stock exceeded a threshold price that we had determined and stated in the draw down notice 
the per share price then equaled the daily volume weighted average price on each date during the pricing period  less a to discount based on our market capitalization 
however  if the daily volume weighted average price fell below the threshold price on any day in the pricing period  acqua wellington was not required to purchase the pro rata portion of shares allocated to that day  but could elect to buy that pro rata portion of shares at the threshold price less the applicable to discount 
upon each sale of our common stock to acqua wellington under the purchase agreement  we had also agreed to pay reedland capital partners  an institutional division of financial west group  member nasd sipc  a placement fee equal to one fifth of one percent of the aggregate dollar amount of common stock purchased by acqua wellington 
further  if during a draw down pricing period we entered into an agreement with a third party to issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock excluding stock or options granted pursuant to our stock option  stock purchase or shareholder rights plans  common stock or warrants issued in connection with licensing agreements and or collaborative agreements and warrants issued in connection with equipment financings at a net discount to the then current market price  if we issued common stock with warrants other than as provided in the prior parenthetical  or if we implemented a mechanism for the reset of the purchase price of our common stock below the then current market price  then acqua wellington could elect to purchase the shares so requested by us in the draw down notice at the price established pursuant to the prior paragraph  to purchase such shares at the third party s price  net of discount or fees  or to not purchase our common stock during that draw down pricing period 
the purchase agreement also provided that from time to time  in our sole discretion  we could grant acqua wellington a right to exercise one or more call options to purchase additional shares of our common stock during a drawn down pricing period  in an amount and for a threshold price that we determined and stated in the draw down notice 
however  the total call amount for any given draw down could exceed a specified maximum amount  and the amount of proceeds we could receive by exercise of a call option for any given trading day was also limited 
if acqua wellington exercised the call option  we were obligated to issue and sell the shares of our common stock subject to the call option at a price equal to the greater of the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on the day acqua wellington exercises its call option  or the threshold price for the call option that we determine  less a to discount based on our market capitalization 
the combined total value of shares that we had the ability to sell to acqua wellington through draw downs and call option exercises under the financing arrangement could not exceed million or  shares of our common stock  whichever occurred first 
as of december   we had issued  shares of our common stock to acqua wellington under this financing arrangement for net cash proceeds of approximately million 
in january  we reached the million limit of this financing arrangement by selling  shares of common stock to acqua wellington for net proceeds of approximately million 
risks and uncertainties related to our product development efforts and future capital requirements according to industry statistics  it generally takes to years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the united states 
drug development in the united states 
is a process that includes 
table of contents multiple steps defined by the fda under applicable statutes  regulations and guidance documents 
after the pre clinical research process of identifying  selecting and testing in animals a potential pharmaceutical compound  the clinical development process begins with the filing of an ind or equivalent foreign filing 
if successful  an ind allows clinical study of the product candidate 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii and iii 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are usually for phase iii trials  which tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after the completion of a successful preclinical and clinical development program  an nda must be filed with the fda  which includes among other things very large amounts of preclinical and clinical data and results and manufacturing related information necessary to support requested approval of the product candidate 
the nda must be reviewed by the fda  and the review and approval process is often uncertain  time consuming and costly 
in light of the steps and complexities involved  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
actual product timelines and costs are subject to enormous variability and are very difficult to predict  as our clinical development programs are updated and changed to reflect the most recent clinical and preclinical data and other relevant information 
in addition  various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the testing  manufacturing  safety reporting  labeling  storage  recordkeeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these regulatory reviews and approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals for our potential products could materially adversely affect our business 
conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval are lengthy  time consuming and expensive processes 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products  we must demonstrate to regulatory authorities through preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans 
we will continue to incur substantial expenditures for  and devote a significant amount of time to  preclinical testing and clinical trials 
the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties that may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources to a significant extent 
we may require substantial additional funding in order to complete our research and development activities and commercialize any potential products 
for at least the next months  we expect to be able to fund our current operations from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which totaled million as of december  however  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional funding prior to then or that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research  development and commercialization programs  the size and complexity of these programs  the timing  scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  our ability to establish and maintain corporate partnerships  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing preclinical and clinical material and other factors not within our control 
we cannot guarantee that the additional financing to meet our capital requirements will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research  development or commercialization programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose  or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
the significant amounts of capital that we are spending to provide and or enhance infrastructure  headcount and inventory in preparation for the sales and marketing of aceon and the potential launch of ranexa could be lost if we do not receive united states marketing approval for the aceon supplemental new drug application or for ranexa 
our aceon and ranexa commercialization efforts include building our sales and marketing infrastructure  increasing our marketing communications efforts  and planning for the hiring and 
table of contents training of a national sales force 
we spent approximately million on these activities from january  through december  if the fda does not approve the aceon supplemental new drug application or ranexa  these expenditures and any future commitments of capital could be lost 
the loss of this investment may harm our business  increase our cash requirements  increase the volatility of our stock price and result in additional operating losses 
in addition  if fda approval of the aceon supplemental new drug application or ranexa is delayed  we will incur additional commercialization expenses at a later date to prepare for a delayed launch of ranexa 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase substantially as we start to co promote aceon in the united states in moreover  if the fda does approve ranexa  we expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in connection with the market launch of the product 
we have experienced significant operating losses since our inception in  including net losses of million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
since our inception  we have been engaged in research  development and pre commercialization activities 
in december we entered into a co promotion arrangement with solvay pharmaceuticals with respect to the cardiovascular product known as aceon  pursuant to which we will start to market and promote our first approved product 
the process of developing and commercializing our product candidates requires significant research and development work  preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as regulatory approvals  significant marketing and sales efforts  and manufacturing capability 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  require significant investments and are expected to continue to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we have not generated any product revenues to date  and even after we generate product related revenues relating to aceon and other approved products  if any  we may never achieve or sustain profitability 
for example  we expect that our marketing and sales costs will significantly increase as we start to co promote aceon in the united states in  and we do not expect to obtain sufficient revenues from aceon alone to achieve or sustain profitability
