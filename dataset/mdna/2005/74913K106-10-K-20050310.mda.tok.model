restatement of financial statements for and on march   the company announced that it was restating its third quarter financial results to reverse all previously recorded revenue associated with infotech 
the company believed at the time of the shipments that collection of the receivable was probable due to the establishment of a credit line by infotech that could be used for payment 
after the shipments of software product  the company has encountered unanticipated delays in obtaining payment from infotech 
based on further analysis of infotech s ability to pay for the software purchased  the accounting for the revenue recognized was revised from an accrual to a cash basis 
as a result  we materially restated our previously announced financial results for the third and fourth quarters of by the deletion of all revenue and commissions that had been recorded related to infotech 

table of contents as a result of this restatement  the company s audit committee retained independent counsel to conduct a full investigation of the infotech relationship 
additionally  the company  in conjunction with new management and under direction of its board of directors  undertook a review of all historical accounting policies and practices 
as a result of this subsequent review  additional accounting inaccuracies were identified affecting the company s financial results for the years ended december  and accordingly the company restated its historical financial results for the years ending december  and this restatement is described in note the financial results for the years ended december  and were restated in august to properly account for transactions that were previously inaccurately reflected in the company s financial results 
the cumulative effect of these restated financial statements increased the previously reported net loss by million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  these inaccuracies a overstated software license revenues due to the timing of delivery of software products and the accounting for certain reseller relationships b overstated professional services revenues due to the timing of adjustments to estimates used in determining the recognition of revenue under the percentage of completion method and c understated the cost of professional services revenue due to the capitalization of software development costs without properly deducting the portion of the cost related to a professional services agreement with a customer 
the restatement also decreased current assets by million and and increased current liabilities by million and million at december  and  respectively 
a summary of the restatement impact is set forth below 
year ended year ended december  december  restated restated decrease in total revenue increase in net loss increase in net loss per share critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the company relied on significant estimates in preparing the financial statements  allocating the purchase price of its acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired  evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debt  the percentage of completion of fixed priced professional service contracts  the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recoverability of capitalized software costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
our license agreements generally provide either that customers pay a license fee based on a specified number of instances of the software on the type of software modules licensed or pay a subscription fee for a set number of years 
customers that purchase licenses  under a perpetual license agreement  generally enter into renewable one year maintenance agreements that entitle the customer to receive unspecified updates on the licensed software  error corrections and telephone support  generally for a fixed fee 
the methodology the company uses to recognize perpetual license software license and related services revenue is dependent on whether the company has established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the separate elements of a multiple element agreement 
if an agreement includes both license 
table of contents and service elements  the license fee is recognized on delivery of the software if the remaining services are not essential to the functionality of the software  the collection of the fees is probable  the fees are fixed and determinable  an agreement is signed and the company has established vsoe of fair value for the remaining services 
revenue from the related services is recognized as the services are provided 
when the related services are essential to the functionality of the base product  or when the company has not established vsoe of fair value for the remaining services  the software license fees are deferred and the entire contract is recognized as the services are provided 
utilizing the criteria provided in sop  we evaluate the vendor specific objective evidence for contracts to determine the fair value of elements delivered in situations where multiple element arrangements exist 
professional services revenue represents software development  implementation and consulting services 
when derived from a fixed price contract and collection of fees is probable  the company recognizes professional services revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
when derived from a time and materials contract  and the collection of fees is probable  the company recognizes professional services revenue as the services are provided 
when revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion basis of accounting  the company s management estimates the costs to complete the services to be provided under the contract 
because the percentage of completion method is an estimation process  it has risks and uncertainties 
the company may encounter budget and schedule overruns caused by external factors beyond our control such as the utilization and efficiency of our consultants and the complexity of our customers it environment 
adjustments to cost estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
estimated losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which the current estimates of the costs to complete the services exceed the revenue to be recognized under the contract 
maintenance revenue is derived from agreements for providing unspecified software updates  error corrections and telephone support 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is generally months 
process management and services revenue represent application hosting  transaction processing and other services 
when the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection of the fees is probable  revenue is recognized over the service period 
when the fees are charged on a per transaction basis and collection of the fees is probable  revenue is recognized as the transactions are processed 
when collection of fees is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected 
the company does not require collateral from its customers 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to pay their accounts receivable balances 
the company assesses financial condition of its customers to determine if there is an impairment of their ability to make payments and additional allowances may be required if the financial condition to the company s customers deteriorates 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in order to determine the realization of our receivables  including assessing the likelihood of collection and the creditworthiness of each customer 
bad debt expense for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
purchase accounting in connection with acquisitions  we assessed the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
items such as accounts receivable  property and equipment  other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities  and other reserves require a high degree of management judgment 
we may used third parties to assist us with such valuations 
we received a third party valuation of assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  for the rogue wave and carescience acquisitions in the fourth quarter and adjusted our asset value accordingly 
in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the 
table of contents acquired businesses 
other intangible assets include  developed technology  customer related assets such as order backlog  and trade name 
the company recorded million of goodwill resulting from its rogue wave and carescience acquisitions 
at december   we had intangible assets of  net of amortization 
software development costs software development costs are required to be expensed until the point that technological feasibility of the product is established 
once technological feasibility is established  development costs are capitalized until the product has reached general availability 
the establishment of technological feasibility and continuing evaluation of the recoverability of the capitalized software development costs requires management s judgment with respect to the impact of external factors such as future revenue  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technologies 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated life  which is generally three years 
the company capitalizes internal and external labor costs incurred in developing the software once technological feasibility is attained 
at december   the company had million of capitalized software development costs  net of amortization 
asset impairments sfas no 
requires that goodwill at each reporting unit be tested annually for impairment and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate assets might be impaired 
the company performed a transitional impairment test upon the adoption of sfas no 
on january  and recorded no impairment because of this test 
the company has identified the fourth quarter as the period for its annual impairment test 
however  due to significant negative industry and economic trends affecting the market value of the company s common stock  the company performed an interim test of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of as a result of this interim test  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill based on the amount that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value 
this impairment charge eliminated goodwill associated with all previous acquisitions 
in connection with the acquisition of rogue wave and carescience  the company has recorded goodwill of approximately million and million  respectively 
these divisions each represent reporting units 
the company performed its annual evaluation of these reporting units during the fourth quarter of  and no impairment was indicated 
however  changes in future market conditions or assumptions used in the evaluation could result in impairments in future periods 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of other long lived assets  including  but not limited to  property and equipment  software  and intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
significant estimates are utilized to calculate expected future cash flows utilized in impairment analyses 
we also utilize judgement to determine other factors within fair value analyses  including the applicable discount rate

recently issued accounting pronouncements in december the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair value 
pro forma disclosure and the intrinsic value method of accounting are no longer alternatives 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we plan to adapt this standard starting july  using a modified prospective 
table of contents method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning july  based on the requirements of sfas no r for all share based payments granted after that date  and for all awards granted to employees prior to july  that had not yet vested based on the requirements of sfas no 
the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and the company has not determined which option pricing model we will use to value the stock options granted 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
risk factors the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in any forward looking statements related to our business 
we have historically incurred losses and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability 
we incurred losses for the years ended december    and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses that may exceed our revenue 
as a result  we may experience losses and negative cash flows in the future 
failure to achieve and maintain profitability may cause our stock price to decline and impair our business and financial prospects 
we face risks related to a formal investigation being conducted by the sec 
we have been cooperating with the sec with respect to a formal order of investigation and subpoena regarding certain transactions in and we cannot predict the outcome of the investigation 
an unfavorable outcome with respect to this investigation could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
if the sec finds wrongdoing on our part  a financial or administrative penalty may be imposed which could jeopardize our financial viability 
in addition  such findings could provide basis for additional lawsuits 
we face risks related to the class action and derivative lawsuits 
certain former officers  independent directors and the company have been named defendants in various class action and derivative lawsuits 
the findings and outcome of the sec investigations may affect these pending lawsuits 
under delaware law  our charter and bylaws  we are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers who are named defendants in any of these lawsuits and advance legal fees and costs 
we are unable to estimate our liability in these matters and we may be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses in aggregate amounts that could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we currently have director and officer liability insurance that may pay a portion of the legal fees and costs incurred in defending against claims  settlement amounts  or  damages awarded 
however  if the plaintiffs are successful  we may not have sufficient insurance to cover the judgment or our insurers may deny coverage

table of contents we have experienced and may encounter ongoing significant employee turnover that could reduce our ability to sell  deliver  and support future commitments 
due to issues experienced in related to our restatements  late sec filings  nasdaq delisting activities and shareholder litigation  we have experienced and could continue to encounter a significant increase in departures of key employees from the company 
while having taken steps to support employee retention  there can be no assurances that key employees will not leave the company for other jobs thus impairing our ability to meet commitments and sustain revenue 
we may be immediately delisted from nasdaq if we cannot meet the more stringent criteria nasdaq established for our continued listing 
we failed to timely file our first quarter form q with the sec and nasdaq 
as a result  the nasdaq stock market initiated delisting procedures 
on august   nasdaq informed us that we had been granted an exception to their continued listing standards 
however  our continued listing depends on our ability to timely file all periodic reports for reporting periods ending on or before september   and we will not be able to request an automatic extension to prolong the deadline 
if we are late in making any filing during that period  we may be delisted immediately with no right to a hearing or appeal 
additionally  we must continue to meet all other continued listing requirements  or failure to do so may result in a notice of delisting to which we would be able to request a hearing 
our continued delisting vulnerability may result in potential loss of investor confidence  loss of analyst coverage and depression of our stock price  which could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial prospects 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  causing our share price to decline  we may lose coverage 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future 
moreover  our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in that event  our stock price would likely decline 
further declines in our stock price may impair our business prospects and our financial condition 
as a result of our limited history of profitable operations  our business strategy  and the evolving nature of the markets in which we compete  we may have difficulty accurately forecasting our revenue in any given period 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this section  a number of factors may cause our revenue to fall short of our expectations or cause fluctuations in our operating results  including delay in our introduction of new applications  services and products offerings and enhancements of our existing solutions  the capital and expense budgeting decisions of our existing and prospective customers  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the implementation of our business strategy  increased product development and engineering expenditures required to keep pace with technological changes  overall economic conditions of the us and the rest of the world  overall economic conditions in the software and information systems  healthcare  telecommunications  financial services and public sector  the loss of one or more major customers the size  type and timing of individual license transactions  the adoption of new technologies  our success in expanding our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  
table of contents our ability to position our products and solutions in the market to drive priority and action within our prospects  obsolescence of our products or the programming languages that our products are designed to enhance  and levels of international sales 
additionally  fluctuating results and declining stock price may cause our analysts to withdraw their coverage  thus reducing our exposure in the market 
we operate in an industry with rapidly changing technology and  if we do not successfully modify our products to incorporate new technologies or introduce new products  our sales will suffer 
the software market in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent introductions of new products  changing customer needs and evolving industry standards 
to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs  we must support existing products and develop new products 
we may not be successful in developing  marketing and releasing new products or new versions of our products that respond to technological developments  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements 
further  we may face significant competition from open source software offerings  provided to users on a no charge basis 
we may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of these enhancements 
in addition  these new products or enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
if release dates of any future products or enhancements are delayed  or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  new products or enhancements by our competitors and open source offerings may cause customers to defer or forego purchases of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face saturated or diminishing markets for some of our key products 
our primary enterprise application integration product offering is sold primarily to the hospital market  and sub segments of this market are close to saturation  and therefore revenues may decrease within this market segment 
in addition  the primary development tools sold by our rogue wave software division target the c programming language  which is diminishing in usage when compared with other programming languages such as java 
we expect that the revenues for these tools may decline over time 
in addition  our performance depends on organizations requiring information delivery  and seeking outside vendors to develop  manage and maintain this software for their critical applications 
many of our potential customers have made significant investments in internally developed systems and would incur significant costs in switching to our products  which may substantially inhibit the growth of our software 
if the market fails to grow  becomes saturated  or declines  our sales will be adversely affected 
in addition  a weakening global economy or diverted focus of information technology departments on issues related to regulatory compliance may lead to longer sales cycle and slower sales growth 
we are engaged in several large software development projects  failure to complete any one of these projects could have adverse consequences on our services revenues and business prospects 
we are engaged in several large  multi year  custom software development projects 
these projects require that we staff them with experienced personnel 
personnel turnover could affect our ability to staff and manage these projects 
additionally  these types of development project require close collaboration with the client  particularly in managing the change order process  and presents factors that are often outside of our control 
the length and nature of these projects expose us to the risk of not completing the project on time or at all  the technology solution could fail to meet client expectations  or within budget  any of which could result in our not being paid for work already performed or could lead to complex and expensive litigation  any of which could materially  adversely affect our financial and business prospects 

table of contents we have risk in sustaining professional service revenue in our markets 
professional services is a very competitive market that is highly dependent on the quality of our staff and service image 
we face much larger competitors in this market segment who have considerably more resources to draw from than we have 
additionally  we face smaller competitors that can be more cost competitive in the delivery of solutions 
our vulnerability to competition is a risk factor in this business 
these issues also impact our service image to present and prospective customers and could cause contract delays 
consequently  professional services revenue may continue to decline for the company 
our public stock price has fallen substantially negatively impacting its investment desirability 
since the disclosure of our restatement of financial statements and the formal investigation by the sec  our stock price has been trading well below the per share minimum threshold established by many institutional investors as criteria for ownership 
we have no assurance that the stock price will rise to previous levels 
these factors may have contributed to reducing the trading activity in our stock and could continue to impair the investment quality of our stock 
several segments of our business rely on the effectiveness of channel partners and third party influencers to help achieve revenue goals 
if we fail to increase and maintain our channel relationships  our business may suffer 
relationships with established channel partners are critical to our success 
these relationships include independent software vendor isv  distributor  co marketer and system integrator relationships 
we rely on these partners ability to assist us in generating increased acceptance and use of our applications  services  and product offerings 
we have established a number of these relationships  and future plans depend on establishing new relationships and maintaining existing ones 
the other parties to these relationships may not view these relationships with us as significant to their own business  and they may reassess their commitment to us or decide to compete directly with us in the future 
we generally do not have agreements that prohibit them from competing against us directly or from contracting with our competitors 
additionally  we cannot guarantee that any such party will perform its obligations as agreed or contemplated or that we would be able to specifically enforce any agreement with it 
our failure to establish and maintain these relationships may significantly impair our business and financial prospects 
we are subjected to many risks because our business is dependent on our intellectual property rights 
we are exposed to infringement risks 
our intellectual property is important to our business 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and the functionality of our applications overlaps with competitive offerings 
these claims  whether or not meritorious  could be expensive  divert our attention from operating our company  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing on their intellectual property rights  we would be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the applications that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in the event an intellectual property claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology or redesign to avoid infringement  most of our contracts would require us to refund a portion of the software license fees  in which case our business  financial condition and results of operations would be seriously harmed 
in addition  we may not be able to protect against misappropriation of our intellectual property 
third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights  we may not detect this unauthorized use and we may be unable to enforce our rights 
we rely on third parties for technology in our products 
we depend upon third party suppliers and licensors to provide software that is incorporated in certain of our products and the products that we distribute 
we have no control over the scheduling and quality of work of these third party software suppliers and 
table of contents licensors 
additionally  the third party software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our agreements to license certain third party software will terminate after specified dates unless they are renewed 
in the event we were to have a dispute with a third party regarding our rights under an agreement  the third party may have the right to terminate our use of such software and or obtain damages 
we expect to sell multiple products to the same customers and problems with the third party technology in one product may adversely affect sales of other products to the same customer 
certain products include so called open source software 
in some cases open source software imposes on us certain requirements to license others both the open source software as well as software that relates to  or interacts with  or is a derivative work of open source software 
these open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products  including the obligation to make source code available 
because open source software is generally available  it cannot be protected as a trade secret and competitors and others would have access to such software and the right to modify or distribute such software 
also  in many instances where we obtain open source software  we would not be able to determine if the provider of such code has legal right to provide such code to the company on the open source license terms 
our products may be affected by unknown software defects 
our products depend on complex software  both internally developed and licensed from third parties 
complex software often contains defects  particularly when first introduced or when enhancements or new versions are released 
although we conduct extensive testing  we may not discover software defects that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed 
to date  we have not experienced any material software defects  however despite continued testing  defects may occur in our software 
these defects could cause performance interruptions  which could damage our reputation with existing or potential customers  increase our service costs  cause us to lose revenue  delay market acceptance or divert our development resources  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
if security of our customer and patient information is compromised  we could be liable for damages and our reputation could decline 
we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace to be secure 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
if we fail to meet our clients expectations  we could be liable for damages and our reputation could suffer 
our insurance may not protect us from this risk 
if compliance with government regulation of healthcare becomes costly and difficult for our customers  we may not be able to grow our business 
participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under numerous federal  state and local laws 
some of these laws apply directly to our business  many other indirectly affect the way we do business 
our healthcare service provider  payer and plan customers are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 
the healthcare market is highly regulated and subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
these factors affect the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations 
changes in current healthcare financing and reimbursement systems  such as the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma  as well as changes in healthcare administration and communications requirements  such as the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  may cause us to make unplanned enhancements of software applications or services  result in delays or cancellations of orders  or result in the revocation of endorsement of our applications and services by healthcare participants 
the immediate and long term effect of the laws such as mma and hipaa is difficult to predict 
there can be no assurances that our products and services will adequately address the business and 
table of contents compliance needs created by these and other enactments  or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state level 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare market participants operate 
at present  there is renewed and increasing interest in healthcare at the federal and state levels  including but not limited to proposing additional privacy  security and or transaction standards for communicating health information  implementing national provider  payer and or patient identifiers  revamping the scope or manner of coverages by state and federal health care programs  and promoting while likely increasing the regulation of systems that enable the exchange of electronic health information 
healthcare market participants may respond to anticipated change in these areas by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in our applications and services 
we do not know what effect these or other proposals would have on our business 
the uncertainty over if  when  and in what form any such proposals would be implemented could have a deleterious impact on our business as customers may choose to wait to see the final form of any such legislation or regulations and or demand guarantees or other concessions related to potential changes 
as we continue to build our international sales  we are subject to increased regulation and uncertainties in the international marketplace 
among other things  our core products contain strong encryption technology that is subject to export control regulation 
these regulations prohibit us from selling in certain countries and to certain persons 
our inadvertent failure to properly restrict our sales could subject us and our management to fines and other sanctions and impair our financial condition and our reputation 
additionally  in the international marketplace we face increased uncertainty of enforcement of contractual provisions and enforcement of judgments in our dealings with non us persons 
our inability to properly defend or enforce our contract rights could materially impair our business prospects and financial condition 
we may face product related liabilities that could force us to pay damages  which would hurt our reputation and financial condition 
although both we and our customers test our applications  services and product offerings  they may contain defects or result in system failures 
these defects or problems could result in the loss of or delay in generating revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation or increased insurance costs 
in particular  we market software products that are designed to assist our healthcare customers in meeting their hipaa compliance obligations 
failure of these products to perform as intended could cause our customers to incur significant fines and penalties for non compliance  which in turn could result in damages and claims against us 
our contracts generally limit our liability arising from our errors  however  these provisions may not be enforceable and may not adequately protect us from liability 
while we have general liability insurance that we believe is adequate  including coverage for errors and omissions  we may not be able to maintain this insurance on reasonable terms in the future 
in addition  our insurance may not be sufficient to cover large claims and our insurer could disclaim coverage on claims 
if we are liable for an uninsured or underinsured claim or if our premiums increase significantly  our financial condition could be materially harmed 
if we do not establish and maintain our brands  our reputation could be adversely affected 
in order to increase our customer base  we must establish  maintain and strengthen our brands 
for us to be successful in establishing our brands  professionals in the healthcare and other targeted markets must perceive us as offering quality  cost effective communications  information and administrative services 
our reputation and brand names could be harmed if we experience difficulties in introducing new applications  services and product offerings  if these applications  services and product offerings are not accepted by customers  if we are required to discontinue existing applications  services and product offerings or if our products and services do not function properly 

table of contents goodwill is a major asset and is subject to an annual test for impairment 
goodwill at december  totaled million which is of total assets 
the goodwill balance resulted from our acquisitions 
because we have adopted financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test goodwill annually for impairment and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate assets might be impaired 
risks described elsewhere in this section could impair the market value of our common stock or our ability to generate cash flow in the future  which could result in the impairment of this asset 
we are in a highly competitive market 
the markets for application development tools and for systems integration and business process management software are highly competitive 
competition  when coupled with the rapid evolution of technology and business practices  presents each of our operating divisions with a challenging environment 
our success and ability to compete depend in part on our proprietary technology  our brand recognition and market awareness  and the features  functionality and quality of our products 
we face many competitive factors which could contribute to our loss of market share  reduced profit margins  increased operating expense or discounted offerings 
competition in the application development market and the healthcare market is strong and many of our competitors have greater financial and organizational resources than we do 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we currently develop and market our products primarily in the united states 
as a majority of sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our product less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
due to the short term term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material interest risk exposure 
based on the foregoing  no quantitative disclosures have been provided
