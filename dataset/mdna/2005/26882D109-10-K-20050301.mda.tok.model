item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s overview our operations consist primarily of integrated technology based products and services for fiduciary management and claims administration applications 
our solutions enable clients to optimize the administration of large and complex bankruptcy  class action  mass tort  and other similar legal proceedings 
we have two operating segments case management and document management 
our case management segment generates revenue primarily through integrated technology based products and services for class action  mass tort and bankruptcy proceedings that support client engagements that generally last several years and has a revenue profile that typically includes a recurring component 
our document management segment generates revenue primarily through legal noticing services  reimbursement for costs incurred related to postage on mailing services  media campaign and advertising management and document custody services 
document management revenue is generally less recurring due to the unpredictable nature of the frequency  timing and magnitude of the clients business requirements 
the number of new bankruptcy filings each year may vary based on the level of consumer and business debt  the general economy  interest rate levels and other factors 
for the government fiscal years ended september    and  the administrative office of the us courts reported approximately million  million  and million new bankruptcy filings  respectively 
we believe an important indicator of future bankruptcy filings is the level of consumer and business debt outstanding 
the most recent available federal reserve flow of funds accounts of the united states  dated december   reported increases in both consumer and business debt outstanding as compared with the same period of the prior year 
during  we determined that our infrastructure software segment was no longer aligned with our long term strategic objectives  and we developed a plan to sell this segment within a year 
accordingly  our infrastructure software results for   and  including our gain on disposition of the infrastructure software business  are included entirely within the discontinued operations section of our income statement 
we believe this disposition will enhance long term shareholder value by enabling us to focus our management and financial resources on the operations of our case management and document management operations 
we have acquired a number of businesses during the past several years 
in january  we acquired bsi to expand our offerings to include an integrated solution of a proprietary technology platform and professional services for chapter restructurings 
in january  we acquired poorman douglas and expanded our product and service offerings to include class action  mass tort  and other similar legal proceedings 
as discussed under the caption results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  below  the increase in both our revenue and our costs during is primarily attributable to our acquisition of poorman douglas 
poorman douglas has significant reimbursed revenue  primarily related to postage  on which we realize little or no profit 
as a result  we now separately report revenue before reimbursed revenue  which we refer to as operating revenue  and which management believes is a more relevant measure of our performance 
the acquisitions of poorman douglas and bsi have also affected our operating revenue mix 
for the year ended december   which was prior to our acquisition of either poorman douglas or bsi  document management operating revenue represented of our total operating revenue 
for the year ended december   during which we acquired bsi  our document management operating revenue represented of our total operating revenue 
for the year ended december   during which we acquired poorman douglas  our document management operating revenue represented of our total operating revenue 
this increase in the mix of document management revenue versus case management revenue may result in increased revenue fluctuations from period to period based on our clients business requirements 
also during  we had notable changes to our capital structure 
during june  we issued million of convertible notes 
net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay and terminate our subordinated term loan and to pay in full our revolving loan 
during july  we entered into a new credit facility with keybank national association as administrative agent 
this facility consists of a million senior term loan  with amortizing quarterly principal payments of million beginning september   and a million senior revolving loan 
during the term of the loan we have the right  subject to compliance with our covenants  to increase the senior revolving loan to million 
the senior term loan and the senior revolving loan mature june  critical accounting policies we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  business combinations  goodwill  and identifiable intangible assets to be critical policies in understanding our historical and future performance 
revenue recognition 
we have agreements with customers obligating us to deliver various products and services each month 
case management fees paid are contingent upon the month to month delivery of the products and services defined by the contracts and are related primarily to the size and complexity of the ongoing engagement 
the formula based fees earned each month become fixed and determinable on a monthly basis as a result of our completion of all contractually required performance obligations related to products delivered and services rendered by us during the month 
document management revenues are recognized in the period the services are provided 
significant sources of revenue include a monthly fee from financial institutions based on a percentage of total liquidated assets on deposit and on the number of trustees  fees for database conversions  database processing  maintenance and software upgrades  monthly revenue based on the number of cases in a database  fees based on the number of claims in a case  and fees for services  including technology services  claims reconciliation  document printing  noticing  balloting  voting tabulation and other professional services 
business combination accounting 
we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting  often referred to as purchase accounting  requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in amounts equal to the fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized on a straight line basis over the intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of amortizable identifiable intangible assets range from two to years 
goodwill and certain other identifiable intangible assets are not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 
goodwill 
we assess goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  for impairment as of each july and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
this assessment is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
a change in events or circumstances  including a decision to hold an asset or group of assets for sale  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
during november  we determined that our infrastructure software segment was no longer aligned with our long term strategic objectives and we developed a plan to sell this segment within a year 
as a result  we recognized a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million related to goodwill during the year ended december  the estimate of fair value is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than the reporting unit s carrying value  then we will recognize an impairment charge 
if goodwill on our balance sheet becomes impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our unimpaired  recognized goodwill totaled million as of december  identifiable intangible assets 
each period we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each identifiable intangible asset 
if events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an identifiable intangible asset s remaining useful life  then the remaining carrying amount of the identifiable intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
furthermore  information developed during our annual assessment  or other events and circumstances  may indicate that the carrying value of one or more identifiable intangible assets is not recoverable and its fair value is less than the identifiable intangible asset s carrying value and would result in recognition of an impairment charge 
during november  we determined that our infrastructure software segment was no longer aligned with our long term strategic objectives and we developed a plan to sell this segment within a year 
as a result  we recognized a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million related to identifiable intangible assets during the year ended december  a change in the estimate of the remaining life of one or more identifiable intangible assets or the impairment of one or more identifiable intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our identifiable intangible assets carrying value  net of amortization  was million as of december  results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  consolidated results revenue total revenue of million for the year ended december  represents an approximate increase compared with million of revenue for the same period in the prior year 
with our acquisition of poorman douglas  revenue related to reimbursed expenses  such as postage pertaining to document management services  increased significantly 
we reflect the revenue from these reimbursed expenses as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of income 
while revenues from reimbursed expenses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  these fluctuations have a minimal effect on our operating income as we realize little or no margin from this revenue 
revenue exclusive of revenue related to reimbursed expenses  which we refer to as operating revenue  increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
all revenue is directly related to a segment and changes in revenue by segment are discussed below 
operating expenses direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase primarily results from the inclusion of poorman douglas expenses subsequent to the acquisition date 
as a result of the poorman douglas acquisition  we realized a higher ratio of document management revenue relative to case management revenue than during the same period in the prior year  which resulted in an increase in reimbursed expenses 
in addition  corporate administrative costs not attributable to segment operations increased primarily due to significant increased expenses related to compliance with regulations and standards imposed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  increased amortization expense primarily resulting from our acquisition of additional operating software licenses  increased travel expense primarily related to additional locations  and increased insurance coverage due to business expansion 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
all identifiable intangible assets are directly related to a segment and changes in amortization of identifiable intangible assets by segment are discussed below 
acquisition related expenses of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  result from non capitalized expenses for executive bonuses  legal  accounting and valuation services  and travel incurred in connection with potential and completed transactions 
expenses related to financing expenses related to financing totaled million during the year ended december  compared with million of interest income during the same period in the prior year 
this increase related to various financing components 
during the year ended december   we recognized a million charge for the write off of loan fees related to a credit facility we terminated 
variable interest expense related to our credit facilities  fixed interest expense related to our convertible debt  and interest accreted on debt with no stated interest rate totaled million during the year ended december  amortization of loan fees related to our credit facilities and related to our convertible debt offering totaled million during the year ended december  our convertible debt facility includes a provision allowing the convertible debt holders to extend the debt maturity from three years to six years 
under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  this provision is accounted for as an embedded option 
at inception  the embedded option was valued at million and the convertible debt balance was reduced by the same amount 
the convertible debt accretes approximately million each quarter such that  at the end of three years  the convertible debt balance will total million 
the embedded option must be revalued at each period end based on the probability weighted discounted cash flows related to the additional interest rate payments which would be made if the convertible debt maturity is extended an additional three years 
while the changes in fair value of the embedded option and carrying value of the convertible debt do not affect our current cash flow  the aggregate of these changes in value  totaling million of expense for the year ended december   is accounted for as a current income or expense item and is included on our accompanying consolidated statements of income as a component of interest expense 
if the embedded option is eventually exercised  the value assigned to the embedded option will be amortized to income as a reduction to our convertible debt interest expense over the periods payments are made 
if the option is not exercised by some or all convertible debt holders  any remaining related value assigned to the embedded option will be recognized as a gain during that period 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate related to income from continuing operations increased slightly from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  our tax rate is higher than the statutory federal rate of primarily due to state taxes  including taxes related to our new york operations which are subject to relatively high state and local new york tax rates 
discontinued operations our infrastructure software results are included entirely within the discontinued operations section of our income statement 
pre tax income from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from our gain on sale of the business  partly offset by operating losses through the date of sale 
pre tax loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  was primarily the result of a million impairment charge to reduce goodwill  other intangible assets  software and other long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
business segments revenue case management operating revenue increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  this increase is a result of the inclusion of operating revenue related to the poorman douglas acquisition subsequent to the acquisition date 
exclusive of poorman douglas operating revenue  operating revenue declined by million due primarily to a decrease in non recurring bankruptcy case management professional service revenue  partly offset by an increase in bankruptcy deposit based revenue 
document management operating revenue increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  document management revenue for reimbursed expenses of million for the year ended december  increased approximately compared with the same period in the prior year 
the increases in both operating revenue and reimbursed revenue for the document management segment were primarily the result of the acquisition of poorman douglas 
exclusive of poorman douglas revenue  our document management operating revenue declined million due primarily to a decrease in bankruptcy noticing services 
document management revenues can fluctuate materially from period to period based on clients business requirements 
operating expenses case management direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase primarily results from the inclusion of poorman douglas expenses subsequent to the acquisition date 
exclusive of poorman douglas expenses  case management s direct and administrative expenses  including depreciation and software amortization  increased million due primarily to increases in operating software amortization and wage related expense 
our case management cost structure is relatively stable and generally does not fluctuate materially with changes in operating revenues 
document management direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase primarily results from the inclusion of poorman douglas expenses  including reimbursed expenses  subsequent to the acquisition date 
exclusive of poorman douglas expenses  our document management expenses declined million due primarily to a decline in postage and print expense related to a decrease in noticing services 
document management direct expenses include reimbursed expenses and other operating expenses which are more variable than case management direct expenses and will fluctuate based on document management business requirements delivered 
both the case management and document management segments have identifiable intangible assets 
amortization of case management s identifiable intangible assets increased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
amortization of document management s identifiable intangible assets increased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
for both segments  this increase is due primarily to the amortization expense related to the acquired intangible assets resulting from the poorman douglas transaction and the february commencement of amortization related to the bsi trade name 
note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the total identified intangible assets  the scheduled amortization expense and the scheduled amortization periods for intangible assets acquired through the poorman douglas and bsi acquisitions 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  consolidated results revenue total revenue of million for the year ended december  represents an approximate increase compared with million of revenue during the prior year 
our segment reporting reflects the revenue from reimbursed expenses as a separate line item 
although reimbursed revenues and expenses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  these fluctuations have a minimal effect on our operating income as we realize little or no margin from this revenue 
revenue exclusive of reimbursed expenses  which we refer to as operating revenue  increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million during the prior year 
all revenue is directly related to a segment and changes in revenue by segment are discussed below 
operating expenses direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
this increase results primarily from the inclusion of bsi s expenses subsequent to the bsi acquisition date 
in addition  corporate administrative costs not attributable to segment operations also increased as a result of our growth  including increases in administrative and compensation expense and travel expense to support integration of the operations of bsi into our consolidated operations 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
all identifiable intangible assets are directly related to a segment and changes in amortization of identifiable intangible assets by segment are discussed below 
acquisition related expenses  consisting of executive bonuses  legal  accounting and valuation services  and travel  increased million  to million for the year ended december   due to the investigation of potential acquisitions and non capitalized expenses related to completed acquisitions 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate related to income from continuing operations increased to for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of bsi 
bsi primarily generates revenue in the city and state of new york  both of which have relatively high corporate tax rates 
discontinued operations our infrastructure software results are included entirely within the discontinued operations section of our income statement 
the million increase in infrastructure software s loss before income tax benefit  to a million loss during the year ended december  as compared with million loss during the year ended december   is primarily the result of a million impairment charge to reduce goodwill  other intangible assets  software and other long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
business segments revenue case management operating revenue increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase primarily results from the inclusion of bsi s operating revenue subsequent to the acquisition of bsi on january  the remainder of the increase in our case management operating revenue resulted primarily from an increase in fees related to bankruptcy trustee deposits 
document management operating revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
document management revenue for reimbursed expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
both the increase in operating revenue and the increase in revenue from reimbursed expenses result primarily from the inclusion of bsi s operating revenue and reimbursed revenue subsequent to the bsi acquisition date

document management s direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
this increase is attributable primarily to the inclusion of bsi s expenses subsequent to the bsi acquisition date 
both the case management and document management segments have identifiable intangible assets 
amortization of case management s identifiable intangible assets increased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase primarily results from the amortization expense related to the acquired intangible assets resulting from the bsi transaction 
amortization of document management s identifiable intangible assets was million for the year ended december  document management did not have any identifiable intangible assets prior to the january acquisition of bsi 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities during the year ended december   our operating activities provided net cash of million 
the primary sources of cash from operating activities were net income of million and adjustments for non cash charges and credits  primarily depreciation and amortization and deferred tax charges  of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities as a direct result of assets acquired or liabilities assumed have been excluded from our consolidated statements of cash flows 
however  subsequent to the poorman douglas acquisition  cash flows related to these acquired assets and assumed liabilities are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
for example  accounts payable and accrued expenses assumed as a part of the transaction are not reflected as a source of cash 
the subsequent payment of assumed accounts payable and accrued expenses are  however  reflected as an operating use of cash 
changes in operating assets and liabilities used net cash of million 
the most significant use of cash related to changes in operating assets and liabilities was our payment of approximately million of liabilities assumed in our acquisition of poorman douglas that were the direct result of acquisition related transactions  primarily withholding taxes resulting from the vesting of restricted poorman douglas stock concurrent with the acquisition  and that were due and payable shortly after the transaction closed 
in addition  a reduction in trade payables and accrued expenses  exclusive of the liabilities acquired in the poorman douglas acquisition  used million of cash 
the most significant source of cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was a reduction in accounts receivable of million 
investing activities our most significant use of cash for investing activities was the acquisition of poorman douglas 
net of million cash acquired in the acquisition  we used cash of approximately million related to this transaction 
during the year ended december   we used cash of approximately million to purchase property and equipment 
enhancements to our existing software and development of new software is essential to our continued growth and  during the year ended december   we used cash of approximately million to fund internal costs related to development of software for which technological feasibility has been established 
during april  we completed the sale of our infrastructure software business for cash and a note receivable payable in monthly installments over months 
during the year ended december   we realized cash proceeds of million related to this transaction 
financing activities in conjunction with our acquisition of poorman douglas  we replaced our million line of credit with a million credit facility 
the credit facility consisted of a million senior term loan  with amortizing quarterly principal payments of million beginning april   a million senior revolving loan  and a million subordinated term loan 
at inception of this facility  we borrowed approximately million that  in combination with available cash on hand  was used to finance our acquisition of poorman douglas 
during june  we issued million of contingent convertible subordinated notes 
net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay and terminate our subordinated term loan and to pay in full our revolving loan 
during july  we entered into a new credit facility with keybank national association as administrative agent 
this facility consists of a million senior term loan  with amortizing quarterly principal payments of million beginning september   and a million senior revolving loan 
during the term of the loan  we have the right  subject to compliance with our covenants  to increase the senior revolving loan to million 
the senior term loan and the senior revolving loan mature june  at inception of the new credit facility  we borrowed the million term loan and million of the revolving loan 
we used these proceeds plus available cash on hand to pay in full the borrowings outstanding under our prior credit facility and that credit facility was terminated 
as of december   our borrowings consisted of million from the contingent convertible subordinated notes including the fair value of the embedded option  million under the new credit facility s senior term loan  million under the new credit facility s senior revolving loan  and approximately million of obligations related to capitalized leases and deferred acquisition price 
we believe that the funds generated from operations plus amounts available under our new credit facility s senior revolving loan will be sufficient over the next year to finance currently anticipated working capital requirements  software expenditures  property and equipment expenditures  payments for contractual obligations  interest payments due on our credit facility borrowings  and the required quarterly principal payments of million on our senior term loan 
we may pursue an acquisition in the future and we may use the availability under our revolving loan and cash on hand to finance a future acquisition 
if the acquisition price exceeds the capacity of these sources of financing  we may decide to issue equity  restructure our credit facility  partly finance the acquisition with a note payable  or some combination of the preceding 
covenants contained in our credit facility may limit our ability to consummate an acquisition 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt and future accretion employment agreements capital lease obligations operating leases total a portion of the bsi purchase price was paid in the form of a non interest bearing note  which was discounted using an imputed rate of per annum 
the discount is accreted over the life of the note and each period s accretion is added to the note s principal 
the amount in the above contractual obligation table includes both the note s principal  as reflected on our december  consolidated balance sheet  and all future accretion 
convertible debt is included at stated value of the principal redemption and excludes adjustments related to the embedded option  which will not be paid in cash 
any conversion to our common stock of part or all of the convertible debt will reduce our cash obligation related to the convertible debt 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas expanded the scope of apb opinion no 
to require that the nonmonetary exchange of similar productive assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
epiq is required and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas for our quarter ending september  we do not anticipate that adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of sfas r  likely using the modified version of prospective application  for our quarter ending september  adoption of sfas r will materially increase our recognized compensation expense and will have a material impact on our consolidated income statements and balance sheets 
we are unable to estimate the impact of adoption of this statement on our consolidated financial statements as the impact will depend  in part  on stock awards and stock option awards made prior to the adoption date  whether awards granted were qualified or non qualified  the vesting period of those awards  and forfeitures related to both existing awards and new awards 
subsequent to december   our compensation committee approved acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested options for employees  including an executive officer and non employee directors 
this action will reduce the impact of adoption of sfas r on our consolidated financial statements 
if  subsequent to december   no new awards were issued and no existing awards were forfeited  we estimate that adoption of sfas r would increase our pre tax compensation expense  on an annualized basis  by approximately million 
we do not anticipate that adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
during the year ended december   certain transactions created an exposure to market risk related to other than trading instruments 
we do not actively manage these market risks 
during  we issued million of convertible notes with a fixed interest rate 
while we do not have cash flow risk related to this instrument  the instrument does contain an embedded option related to the right of security holders to extend the maturity of the convertible notes which creates an earnings risk 
a increase in our stock value would result in a million increase in the fair value of the embedded option and a corresponding decrease in earnings 
a decrease in our stock value would result in a million decrease in the fair value of the embedded option and a corresponding increase in earnings 
the estimated changes in fair value were calculated using a pricing model that incorporates assumptions regarding future volatility  interest rates and credit risk 
at december   we have borrowings outstanding under a credit facility 
interest on borrowings under our credit facility is computed at a variable rate based on the libor rate and the prime rate and results in a market risk related to interest rates 
a increase or decrease in the libor rate and the prime rate would have increased or decreased  respectively  our annual interest expense on variable rate borrowings outstanding as of december  by approximately million
