see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  merchandise held for disposition  allowance for losses on cash advances  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  empirical data and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
finance and service charges revenue recognition 
the company accrues finance and service charges revenue only on those pawn loans that the company deems collectible based on historical loan redemption statistics 
pawn loans written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked for performance 
loan transactions may conclude based upon redemption  renewal  or forfeiture of the loan collateral 
the gathering of this empirical data allows the company to analyze the characteristics of its outstanding pawn loan portfolio and estimate the probability of collection of finance and service charges 
in the event the future actual performance of the loan portfolio differs significantly positively or negatively from expectations  revenue for the next reporting period would be likewise affected 
due to the short term nature of pawn loans  the company is able to quickly identify performance trends 
for  million  or  of recorded finance and service charges represented cash collected from customers and the remaining million  or  represented an increase in the finance and service charges receivable during the year 
at the end of the current year and based on the revenue recognition method described above  the company had accrued million of finance and service charges receivable 
assuming the year end accrual of finance and service charges revenue was over estimated by  finance and service charges revenue would decrease by million in and net income would 
table of contents decrease by million 
some or all of the decrease would potentially be mitigated through the profit on the disposition of the related forfeited loan collateral 
merchandise held for disposition 
merchandise held for disposition consists primarily of forfeited collateral from pawn loans not repaid 
the carrying value of the forfeited collateral is stated at the lower of cost cash amount loaned or market 
management provides an allowance for shrinkage and valuation based on its evaluation of the merchandise 
because pawn loans are made without the borrower s personal liability  the company does not investigate the creditworthiness of the borrower  but evaluates the pledged personal property as a basis for its lending decision 
the amount the company is willing to finance is typically based on a percentage of the pledged personal property s estimated disposition value 
the sources for the company s determination of the estimated disposition value are numerous and include the company s automated product valuation system as well as catalogues  blue books  newspapers  internet research and previous experience with similar items 
the company performs a physical count of its merchandise in each location on a cyclical basis and reviews the composition of inventory by category and age in order to assess the adequacy of the allowance  which was million  representing of the balance of merchandise held for disposition at december  adverse changes in the disposition value of the company s merchandise may result in the need to increase the valuation allowance 
allowance for losses on cash advances 
the company maintains an allowance for losses on company owned cash advances including fees and interest and accrues losses for bank owned cash advances at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses in the outstanding combined cash advance portfolio 
the company s cash advance product primarily services a customer base of non prime borrowers 
these advances are typically offered for a term of to days 
cash advances written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked to develop a performance history 
the company stratifies the outstanding portfolio by age  delinquency and stage of collection when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for losses 
current portfolio performance as well as the performance of cash advances made in the same period twelve months ago and collection history are utilized to develop expected loss rates which are used for the establishment of the allowance 
increased defaults and credit losses may occur during a national or regional economic downturn  or could occur for other reasons  resulting in the need to increase the allowance 
unlike pawn loans  cash advances are unsecured  and the performance of the portfolio depends on the company s ability to collect on defaulted loans 
the company believes it effectively manages the risks inherent in this product by utilizing a variety of underwriting criteria  maintaining a customer database of performance and by closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio 
any remaining unpaid balance of a cash advance is charged off once it becomes days past due  or sooner if deemed uncollectible 
at december   allowance for losses on cash advances was million and accrued losses on bank owned cash advances were million  in aggregate representing of the combined cash advance portfolio 
during fiscal year  the cash advance loss provision for the combined cash advance portfolio  which increases the allowance for loan losses  was million and reflects of gross combined cash advances written by the company and third party banks 
assuming future loss rates increased  or decreased  by for  the cash advance loss provision would increase  or decrease  by million and net income would decrease  or increase  by million  assuming the same volume of cash advances written in valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets may not be recoverable  impairment is measured based on the excess of the assets carrying value over the estimated fair value 

table of contents income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
an expense  or benefit  must be included within the tax provision in the statement of operations for any increase  or decrease  in the valuation allowance for a given period 
management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize the deferred tax assets resulting from capital losses 
the valuation allowance is based on company estimates of capital gains expected to be recognized during the period over which the capital losses may be used to offset such gains 
in the event that the company determined that it would not be able to realize all or part of its other net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to provision for income taxes in the period that such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would reduce the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination was made

higher levels of merchandise available for disposition over the long term could result in lower profit margins which is generally offset by higher proceeds 
the addition of superpawn operating results in should increase the average profit margin slightly due to a higher amount of jewelry sales which has historically produced higher gross profit margins 
however  the increases in jewelry merchandise levels could reduce inventory turnover

accordingly  actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements  and such statements should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the results expressed in the statements will be achieved 
risk factors important risk factors that could cause results or events to differ from current expectations are described below 
these factors are not intended to be an all encompassing list of risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business 
changes in customer demand for the company s products and specialty financial services could adversely affect results 
although the company s products and services are a staple of its customer base  a significant change in the needs or wants of customers and the company s failure to adapt to those needs or wants could result in a significant decrease in the revenues of the company 
the actions of third parties who offer products  services or support at the company s locations could adversely affect results 
the company makes products and services available to its customers through various third parties 
a failure of a third party provider to provide its product or service or to maintain the quality and consistency of its product or service could result in a loss of customers and a 
table of contents related loss in revenue from those products or services 
the company also utilizes third parties to support and maintain certain of its computerized point of sale and information systems 
the failure of such a third party to fulfill its support and maintenance obligations could cause a disruption in the company s unit operations 
circumstances could adversely affect the ability of the company to open and acquire new operating units in accordance with its plans 
the company s expansion program is subject to numerous factors which cannot be predicted or controlled  such as the availability of attractive acquisition candidates and the company s ability to attract  train and retain qualified unit management personnel 
another such factor is the availability of sites with acceptable restrictions and suitable terms and general economic conditions 
changes in competition from various sources such as banks  savings and loans  short term consumer lenders  and other similar financial services entities  as well as retail businesses that offer products and services offered by the company  could put additional pressure on the company 
the company encounters significant competition in connection with its lending and merchandise disposition operations from other pawnshops  cash advance companies and other forms of financial institutions such as consumer finance companies 
significant increases in these competitive influences could adversely affect the company s operations through a decrease in the number of cash advances and pawn loans originated  resulting in lower levels of earning assets in these categories 
changes in economic conditions could reduce earnings 
while the credit risk for most of the company s consumer lending is mitigated by the collateralized nature of pawn lending  a sustained deterioration in the economic environment could adversely affect the company s operations through a deterioration in performance of its pawn loan or cash advance portfolios  or by reducing consumer demand for the purchase of pre owned merchandise 
adverse real estate market fluctuations could affect the company s profits 
a significant rise in real estate prices could result in an increase in the cost of store leases as the company opens new locations and renews leases for existing locations 
interest rates could rise and affect earnings 
although the softness in the us economy over the past several years has resulted in relatively low interest rates offered by lending institutions  the federal reserve bank has embarked on a program to gradually increase the federal funds rates 
if current trends continue in interest rates  this could increase the cost of borrowing to the company 
changes in the capital markets or the company s financial condition could reduce available capital 
the company regularly accesses the debt capital markets to refinance existing debt obligations and to obtain capital to finance growth 
efficient access to these markets is critical to the company s ongoing financial success  however  the company s future access to the debt capital markets could become restricted should the company experience deterioration of its cash flows  balance sheet quality  or overall business or industry prospects 
changes in tax and other laws and governmental rules and regulations applicable to the specialty financial services industry can have adverse effects 
the company s lending activities are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations 
the company faces the risk that new laws and regulations could be enacted that could have a negative impact on the company s us lending activities 
other factors are discussed under quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
other risks that are indicated in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission may apply as well 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and gold prices 
the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
management s objective is to minimize the cost of borrowing through an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate cap agreements  may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from ongoing business operations 
after considering the effectiveness  if any  of the interest rate cap agreements  the company had net variable rate borrowings outstanding of million and million at december  and  respectively 
if prevailing interest rates were to increase basis points over the rates at december  and  respectively  and the variable rate borrowings outstanding remained constant  the company s interest expense would increase by million and million  and net income after taxes would decrease by million and million in and  respectively 
if prevailing interest rates were to decrease basis points from the rates at december  and  respectively  the combined fair values of the company s outstanding fixed rate debt million and million  respectively would increase by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
gold price risk 
the company periodically uses forward sale contracts with a major gold bullion bank to sell a portion of the expected amount of refined gold produced in the normal course of business from its liquidation of forfeited gold merchandise 
a significant decrease in the price of gold would result in a reduction of proceeds from the disposition of refined gold to the extent that amounts sold were in excess of the amount of contracted forward sales 
in addition  a significant and sustained decline in the price of gold would negatively impact the value of some of the goods pledged as collateral by customers and identified for liquidation as refined gold 
in this instance  management believes some customers would be willing to add additional items of value to their pledge in order to obtain the desired loan amount 
however  those customers unable or unwilling to provide additional collateral would receive lower loan amounts  possibly resulting in a lower balance of pawn loans outstanding for the company 
foreign exchange risk 
the notes receivable received in the sale of the company s foreign operations are subject to the risk of unexpected change in the swedish kronor exchange rates 
as a result of fluctuations in the swedish kronor  the company recorded foreign currency transaction gains of million in a hypothetical decline in the exchange rate of the swedish kronor at december  would have decreased net income by million
