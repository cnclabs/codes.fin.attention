we intend to retain our earnings to finance future growth  and therefore have not paid dividends  nor do we presently anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
under the program  shares may be purchased in such amounts as market conditions warrant  subject to regulatory and other considerations 
as of february   no shares had been repurchased under the program 
the authorization expires on september in february  we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the exercise of warrants issued as part of the consideration for our acquisition of mind corporation in these warrants were exercised by four former stockholders of mind 
the consideration for these exercises was paid in the form of the surrender of  shares of our common stock under the warrants as a net exercise  which shares were valued at a total of thousand  based on the average closing price of our common stock over the ten consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date of exercise 
we issued these  shares pursuant to the registration exemption under section of the securities act of as of december   there were outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock with a weighted average fair value of per share and a weighted average exercise price of per share 
item selected consolidated financial data the selected consolidated financial data presented below have been derived from our consolidated financial statements 
this data may not be indicative of our future condition or results of operations and should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
year ended december  in thousands  except per share data consolidated statements of operations data total revenue income loss from operations income loss before provision for income taxes net income loss earnings loss per share basic diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic diluted year ended december  in thousands consolidated balance sheet data total cash and short term investments working capital long term license installments  net total assets capital lease obligation  including current portion stockholders equity item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview our total revenue for decreased to million from million in  due to a decrease in our license revenue  which was partially offset by an increase in our services revenue 
excluding the anticipated million reduction in revenue associated with the restructured first data resources fdr agreement  total revenue increased versus the decrease in our license revenue in was due primarily to a decline in term license renewals  extensions and additions  and to an anticipated decline in license revenue from fdr 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in license revenue from new customers  most of which was derived from sales of perpetual licenses of products based on our pegarules technology 
the increase in our services revenue in was primarily due to implementation services associated with new customer signings and to maintenance services associated with an expanded installed base of software 
historically  our mix of license and services revenue has fluctuated from year to year  and we believe that the composition of license and services revenue will continue to fluctuate 
in  new customers ie  organizational units  divisions  or companies from whom we have not previously derived any license revenue accounted for million  or  of our total revenue 
profit before taxes decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a million decrease in license gross margin  and a million increase in selling and marketing expense  partially offset by a million improvement in service margins 
net income for decreased to million from million in due to the decrease in profit before taxes and a higher effective tax rate in we generated million in positive cash flow from operations during  and ended the period with million in cash and marketable securities and million in combined short and long term license installment receivables 
we see three significant trends in our business first  we are increasingly licensing our software pursuant to perpetual licenses  under which a customer pays a single license fee at the commencement of the license  rather than pursuant to term licenses  under which a customer pays a monthly fee during the license term and must renew the license for additional fees to continue to use the software past the original term 
we expect that our use of perpetual licenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future  although we expect to enter into new term licenses in certain instances at the request of our customers 
our increased use of perpetual licenses rather than term licenses has the effect  with respect to a given transaction  of increasing our license revenue and cash flow in the short term  but of decreasing the amount of renewal revenue and cash flow in the future 
second  the percentage of our license revenue relating to our pegarules technology has been increasing 
our pegarules products can be used by a wide range of customers outside of our traditional financial services and health care markets  which has enabled us to increase our sales to customers outside of these traditional markets 
our pegarules products often require less customization and implementation assistance than prior generations of our software products  which in some cases has enabled us to shorten the length of the sales process and the time required to receive customer acceptance of the software product 
however  our experience with these new products is limited in time  and it is too early to determine if shorter sales and implementation cycles will be the norm 
third  we are increasing our reliance on partners to provide implementation services that our customers demand for solutions based upon our products 
we have developed a network of trained and qualified partners that have the capability to provide these services to our customers 
by utilizing these partners  we have increased the supply of skilled service consultants that can assist our customers 
in certain cases  our partners are also able to offer lower prices to our customers due to the use of resources located in other countries  thereby increasing the value to our customers of the overall solution 
some of our partners have more headcount dedicated to consulting services for our products than we have 
we believe that this trend is good for our business because of the breadth of domain expertise that our partners can bring to solutions 
this reliance on partners also reduces the time period for revenue recognition in some instances  because our customers accept our software products upon delivery and obtain additional services from our partners rather than from us 
as a result  we expect that our services revenue may grow more slowly over time than if we did not rely on our partners  but the time from software license signing to license revenue recognition may shorten 
statement of income information the following shows certain items reflected in our statements of income as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  software license revenue services revenue total revenue cost of software license cost of services total cost of revenue gross profit research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations installment receivable interest income other interest income  net other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income international revenues international revenue was  and of total consolidated revenue in  and  respectively 
our international revenue may fluctuate in the future because such revenue is generally dependent upon a small number of product acceptances by our customers during a given period 
historically  most of our contracts have been denominated in us dollars 
we expect  however  that in the future more of our contracts may be denominated in foreign currencies which may expose us to increased currency exchange risk 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue our total revenue for decreased to million from million in this decrease was due to a decline in license revenue  partially offset by an increase in services revenue 
the following table summarizes our revenue composition in millions year ended december  license revenue perpetual licenses and licenses accounted for on a subscription basis term license renewals  extensions and additions total license revenue services revenue implementation  consulting and training services maintenance total services revenue total revenue total license revenue for decreased to million from million for this decrease in total license revenue was the result of a million decrease in term license renewals  extensions and additions  and an anticipated million decline in perpetual license revenue from fdr  partially offset by an million increase in other perpetual and subscription license revenue 
the million decrease in term license renewals  extensions and additions reflects a lower value of scheduled renewals in versus  as well as a reduction in license add ons and extensions associated with those renewals 
in addition  fewer customers renewed term licenses in advance of their scheduled renewal date during as compared to term license renewals scheduled for are modestly higher than renewals in while historically a majority of customers have renewed their term licenses  there can be no assurance that a majority of customers will continue to do so 
services revenue for increased to million from million for this increase was due primarily to an increase in new license implementations in  and higher customer maintenance revenue 
implementation  consulting and training services revenue in increased to million from million for this increase was due primarily to implementation projects associated with new customer signings and more projects reaching completion in typically  we derive substantial revenue from services provided in connection with the implementation of software licensed by new customers 
going forward  as we continue to complement our direct selling and support efforts with those of our alliance partners  we do not expect to sustain this rate of services revenue growth 
maintenance revenue in increased to million from million in the increase in maintenance revenue was due to a larger installed base of software and improved pricing for maintenance support 
deferred revenue at december  consisted primarily of billed fees from arrangements for which acceptance of the software license or service milestone had not occurred  and advance payment of maintenance fees 
deferred revenue balances decreased to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the unearned portion of services revenue related to new software implementations and a decrease in deferred license revenue  partially offset by an increase in the unearned portion of services revenue related to advance payments of maintenance fees 
cost of revenue cost of services consists primarily of the cost of providing implementation  consulting  maintenance  and training services 
our cost of services for decreased to million from million in  primarily due to the redeployment of some of our services staff to pre sales support activities 
cost of services as a percentage of services revenue decreased to for from for the percentage decrease was primarily due to the increase in our services revenue and the redeployment of some of our services staff to pre sales support activities 
services gross margin was million for compared to million for the increase in services gross margin reflects recognition of deferred margin on completed services engagements and improved effectiveness of our professional services staff  achieved in part through the increased use of third party contractors when necessary to meet higher demand 
operating expenses research and development expenses for decreased to million from million for as a percentage of our total revenue  research and development expenses decreased to in from in the decrease in spending was primarily due to reduced r d staff and staff related expenses as well as reduced spending on outsourced r d contractors 
r d headcount at the end of was compared to at the end of selling and marketing expenses for increased to million from million for this increase was due to an increase in our sales personnel  and an increase in sales commissions associated with increased new license bookings  partially offset by a decrease in marketing program spending 
many of the additional sales personnel were hired late in as a percentage of total revenue  selling and marketing expenses increased to in from in  due to the combined effect of increased spending and lower total revenue in selling and marketing headcount at the end of was compared to at the end of general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million for as a percentage of our total revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for from for these increases were primarily due to increased spending in on audit and compliance activities associated with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations as well as increased staff costs 
general and administrative headcount was at the end of compared to at the end of installment receivable interest income installment receivable interest income  which consists of the portion of all term license fees under software license agreements attributable to the time value of money  decreased in to million from million for the decrease was due primarily to a lower average discount rate for our portfolio of term software licenses and a lower total value of that portfolio 
a portion of the fee from each term license arrangement is initially deferred and recognized as installment receivable interest income over the remaining term of the license 
for purposes of the present value calculations  the discount rates used are estimates of customers borrowing rates  typically below prime rate  and have varied between and during the past few years 
it is expected that installment receivable interest income will decline further in due to the lower total value of our portfolio of term software licenses 
other interest income  net other interest income  net  increased to million for from million for the increase was due to increased cash and investment balances and improved yields 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  which consists primarily of currency exchange gains and losses  was million for versus million for the decrease was due to lower currency exchange gains in versus  and expenses incurred in the second quarter of associated with restructuring our investment portfolio 
income before provision for income taxes income before provision for income taxes decreased to million for from million in this decrease was due to a million decrease in license revenue  a million increase in operating expenses primarily due to investments in sales and marketing  a million decrease in other income and expense  partially offset by million improvement in service gross margin 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes in was million compared to million in the effective tax rate was in compared to for this increase in effective rate was due to lower benefits from the recognition of loss and credit carry forwards in compared to  partially offset by improved estimates in of tax benefits related to export sales 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue total revenue for increased to million from million for the increase was due to an increase in services revenue  which was partially offset by a decrease in software license revenue 
total revenue from new customers was of total revenue for  compared with in the increase in services revenue was due primarily to more new license implementation activity in the decrease in license revenue was due mainly to the reduction in revenue from the restructured arrangement with fdr

license revenue  excluding revenue from fdr  grew in from a substantial majority of our software license revenue in and was from existing customers 
the million decrease in perpetual and subscription license revenue in compared to was primarily due to a million reduction in license revenue from fdr  partially offset by an increase in license revenue from new customers 
under the terms of the perpetual license agreement entered into during the first quarter of  when we restructured our arrangement with fdr  fdr made monthly payments through december we recognized revenue under the fdr agreement  through the third quarter of we did not recognize license revenue from this fdr agreement in  however we continued to earn maintenance revenue 
the following table summarizes the revenue we recognized in and under the fdr perpetual license and the prior agreements with fdr in millions year ended december  perpetual licenses and licenses accounted for on a subscription basis implementation  consulting and training services maintenance total revenue term license revenue in was primarily from customers renewing and extending their use of pegasystems software 
discount rates used to recognize term license revenue vary directly with market interest rates 
the discount rates used to recognize term license revenue are estimates of customer borrowing rates at the time license revenue is recognized 
a decrease in the average discount rate resulted in an increase in license revenue of approximately million for versus services revenue for increased to million from million for the increase was due to more new license implementation activity in and new customer maintenance revenue

operating expenses research and development expenses for increased to million from million for as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses remained flat at 
the increase in spending was primarily due to increased investment in our pegarules technology and applications built upon that technology 
increases in spending on outsourced r d contractors were partially offset by decreases in staff related costs

the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
under the program  shares may be purchased in such amounts as market conditions warrant  subject to regulatory and other considerations 
as of february   no shares had been repurchased under the program 
the authorization expires on september  we believe that current cash  cash equivalents  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our business for at least the next twelve months 
material risks to cash flow from operations include delayed or reduced cash payments accompanying sales of new licenses or a decline in our services business 
there can be no assurance that changes in our plans or other events affecting our operations will not result in materially accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
in addition  there can be no assurance that additional capital if needed will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such time as we require 
as of december   we did not have material commitments for capital or operating expenditures other than capital and operating leases 
our principal administrative  sales  marketing  support  and research and development operations are located in an  square foot leased facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
the lease for this facility expires in  with the option to extend for two additional five year periods 
we also lease space for our other offices in the united states  canada  australia  france  and the united kingdom 
these leases expire at various dates through rent expense under operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis  under which scheduled rent increases are expensed in advance of payment 
the excess of expense over current payments is recorded as deferred rent and included in other long term liabilities 
our known contractual obligations as of december  were as follows payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total our liquidity is affected by the manner in which we collect cash for certain types of license transactions 
historically  our term licenses have provided for monthly license payments  generally over five years 
the following amounts of cash are due for receipt in connection with our existing term license agreements years ending december  license installments in thousands and thereafter critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from two primary sources software license fees and service fees 
we offer both perpetual and term software licenses 
perpetual license fees are generally payable at the time the software is delivered  and are generally recognized as revenue when the software is delivered  any acceptance required by contract is obtained  and no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support 
payments subject to refund are recognized as revenue when refund provisions lapse 
term software license fees are generally payable on a monthly basis under term license agreements that generally have a five year term and may be renewed for additional years at the customer s option 
the present value of future license payments is generally recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance  provided that no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support 
a portion of the license fees payable under each term license agreement equal to the difference between the total license payments and the discounted present value of those payments is initially deferred and recognized as installment receivable interest income and is not part of total revenue over the license term 
many of our license agreements provide for license fee increases based on inflation 
when such an increase occurs  as determined by the terms of the license agreement  we recognize the present value of such increases as revenue  the remainder of the increase is recognized as installment receivable interest income over the remaining license term 
for purposes of the present value calculations  the discount rates used are estimates of customers borrowing rates at the time of recognition  typically below prime rate  and have varied between and for the past few years 
as a result  revenue that we recognize relative to these types of license arrangements would be impacted by changes in market interest rates 
for term license agreement renewals  license revenue is recognized with the same present value approach  when the customer becomes committed to the new license terms and no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support 
in certain circumstances  such as when license fees are not fixed or determinable  some term licenses are accounted for on a subscription basis  where revenue is recognized as payments become due over the term of the license 
our services revenue is comprised of fees for software implementation  consulting  maintenance  and training services 
our software implementation and consulting agreements typically require us to provide services for a fixed fee or at an hourly rate 
revenues for time and material projects are recognized as services are delivered and fees are billed 
until the fair value of the elements of a contract can be determined  the recognition of services revenue for fixed price projects is limited to amounts equal to direct costs incurred  resulting in no gross profit 
we do not have a reliable track record for accurately estimating the time and resources needed to complete fixed price service projects 
as a result  determination of the fair value of the elements of the contract has generally occurred late in the implementation process  typically when implementation is complete and remaining services are no longer significant to the project 
if the fair values of the elements of a contract are then apparent  the remaining revenue and profit associated with the fixed price services elements will be recognized when the project is completed 
to the extent that a software license is included in the contract  any residual amounts remaining after revenue is allocated to the services elements are recorded as license revenues 
all costs of services are expensed as incurred 
software license customers are offered the option to enter into a maintenance contract  which usually requires the customer to pay a monthly maintenance fee over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically renewable annually 
prepaid maintenance fees are deferred and are recognized evenly over the term of the maintenance agreement 
we generally recognize training fees revenue as the services are provided 
we reduce revenue for estimates of the fair values of potential concessions  such as disputed services  when revenue is initially recorded 
these estimated amounts are deferred or reserved until the related elements of the agreement are completed and provided to the customer or the dispute is resolved 
our agreements with customers generally require us to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes third party patent  copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights 
such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
as of december   we had not experienced any material losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding 
we do not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations  and consequently  we have concluded that the fair value of these obligations is negligible and we have not established any related reserves 
deferred revenue deferred revenue consists primarily of billed fees from arrangements for which acceptance of the software license or service milestone has not occurred  the unearned portion of services revenue and advance payment of maintenance fees 
we estimate the value of committed and undelivered services to be delivered after license implementation  and defer that amount until the related elements of the agreement are completed and provided to the customer 
we base these estimates on our historical experience 
the timing of revenue recognized under our arrangements with customers is impacted by these estimates  but the total value of revenue recognized during the arrangements is not 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts using estimates that we make based on factors we believe appropriate such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different assumptions  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase bad debt expense 
stock based compensation we periodically grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees  non employee directors and non employee contractors with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of the grant 
we account for stock option grants to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation associated with stock awards to employees and directors is determined as the difference  if any  between the current fair value of the underlying common stock on the date compensation is measured and the price the employee or director must pay to exercise the award 
the measurement date for employee awards is generally the date of grant 
stock options granted to non employee contractors are accounted for using the fair value method 
under the fair value method  compensation associated with stock awards to non employee contractors is determined based on the estimated fair value of the award itself  measured using either current market data or an established option pricing model 
at december   we had four stock based compensation plans  which are described more fully in note of the notes to the financial statements 
no stock based employee compensation expense is reflected in net income in  and  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and were granted to employees and directors 
the fair value method requires use of an option pricing model  and assumptions required by the selected model 
assumptions required in using these models include average life of options from the vesting date  volatility of our stock price and risk free rate of return 
we have used the black scholes multiple option pricing model during the past few years for our pro forma disclosures in notes to the financial statements regarding what the impact would have been of adopting the fair value method 
we have based our assumptions for average life of options on analyses of the history of activity by holders of in the money options for our common stock 
we have based our assumptions for volatility of our stock price on analyses of the history of the price of our common stock as reported by nasdaq  looking back over a time period approximating the assumed average life of options 
we have assumed a risk free rate of return based on yields of us treasury notes 
we disclose the pro forma effect on our financial results in note m of the notes to the financial statements 
the effects on pro forma net income and earnings per share of the estimated fair value of stock options and estimated dilutive shares are not necessarily representative of the effects on the results of operations in the future 
in addition  the estimates made utilize a pricing model developed for traded options with relatively short lives  our option grants typically have a life of up to ten years and are not transferable 
therefore  the actual fair value of a stock option grant may be different from our estimates 
we believe that our estimates incorporate all relevant information and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non traded stock options 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we are evaluating the two methods of adoption allowed by sfas no 
r  the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective transition method 
adoption of sfas no 
r will significantly increase compensation expense 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires that excess tax benefits related to stock compensation expense be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flow from operations 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and loss and credit carry forwards 
we continue to provide a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the likelihood of their realization 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including deferred tax liabilities that can be used to offset deferred tax assets  estimates of future taxable income of appropriate character within the carry forward period available under the tax law  and tax planning strategies 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws  and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in either a tax benefit  if it is estimated that future taxable income is likely  or a reduction in the value of the deferred tax assets  if it is determined that their value is impaired  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
principal differences between our book and tax accounts are related to the treatment of our license transactions 
we use the operating lease method of recognizing license revenue for tax purposes  so that to the extent we continue to enter into term license contracts  we establish deferred tax liabilities for such future taxable income 
in addition  because we defer recognition of this income into future periods for tax purposes  we have generated substantial tax loss carry forwards which partially offset the related liabilities 
we also earn tax credits in various jurisdictions for our ongoing investment in research and development activities 
as of december   our remaining valuation allowance related to credits  which we expect will expire before we will be able to utilize them  and to loss carry forwards acquired in the mind acquisition  the recognition of which will generally reduce goodwill 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of conducting a global business enterprise  there are many transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transactions and arrangements made among related parties  transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries  and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates 
we estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and estimate the probability for such outcomes 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
provisions have been made for such uncertainties  with reserves totaling approximately million as of december  in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 application of fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp clarifies that the manufacturer s deduction provided for under the american jobs creation act of ajca should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas and not as a tax rate reduction 
until the treasury department or congress provides additional clarifying language on key elements of this deduction  the impact of the adoption of fsp on our results of operations or financial position for and subsequent years cannot be determined 
the fasb also issued fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
the ajca introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
the fsp provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
until the treasury department or congress provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision  the tax impact of foreign earnings that might be repatriated by us  if any  cannot be determined 
the fsp grants an enterprise additional time beyond the year ended december   in which the ajca was enacted  to evaluate the effects of the ajca on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted earnings 
the fsp calls for enhanced disclosures of  among other items  the status of a company s evaluations  the effects of completed evaluations  and the potential range of income tax effects of repatriations 
such disclosures are included in note of the notes to the financial statements 
contingencies from time to time  we are threatened with or become party to litigation 
we periodically assess each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for contingencies  should be recorded 
in making this determination  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated 
should a loss be probable and estimable  we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations that may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operating results to date  and we do not expect it to have a significant impact in the future 
our unbilled license and maintenance fees are typically subject to annual increases based on recognized inflation indices 
significant customers no customer accounted for or more of our total revenue in first data resources accounted for and of our total revenue in and  respectively 
in  another customer accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
factors relating to our revenues we have increasingly been entering into perpetual license transactions with new customers rather than term licenses  which  with respect to such transactions  has the effect of increasing our license revenue and cash flow in the short term and of decreasing the amount of license revenue and cash flow in the future 
in prior years  we typically licensed our software under term licenses requiring the customer to make monthly payments over the license term 
more recently  we have been selling perpetual licenses to our software with a single license fee typically being payable at the commencement of the license 
we expect that our use of perpetual licenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future  although we expect to enter into new term licenses in certain instances at the request of our customers 
our increased use of perpetual licenses has the effect  with respect to such transactions  of increasing our license revenue and cash flow in the short term  but of decreasing the amount of license revenue and cash flow in the future 
if we are unable to increase the volume of new license transactions  given the anticipated decline in the recurring revenue from term license arrangements  our license revenue and cash flow will likely decline in future periods 
if existing customers do not renew their term licenses  our financial results may suffer 
term license renewal negotiations have required more effort due to economic pressures and consolidation among our customers 
a significant portion of our total revenue has been attributable to term license renewals  although this portion has been declining in recent periods due to the increase in perpetual licenses 
while historically a majority of customers have renewed their term licenses  there can be no assurance that a majority of customers will continue to renew expiring term licenses 
in addition  customers may choose to renew their expiring term licenses  but on business terms that require us to account for such renewals on a subscription basis  thereby reducing the amount of revenue we can recognize at the time of renewal under our existing revenue recognition practices 
a decrease in term license renewal revenue absent offsetting revenue from other sources would have a material adverse effect on future financial performance 
our professional services revenue is dependent to a significant extent on closing license transactions with new customers 
we derive a substantial portion of our professional services revenue from implementation of software licensed by new customers and the development of applications by our customers using our software 
increasingly  we are relying on business partners to provide the implementation services for our customers  thus reducing the amount of professional services revenue we derive relative to a given level of license revenue 
accordingly  it is imperative that we close more license transactions with new customers if we are to maintain or grow our services revenue 
factors relating to fluctuations in our financial results the timing of our license revenue is difficult to predict accurately  due to the uncertain timing of the completion of implementation services and product acceptance by the customer 
our quarterly revenue may fluctuate significantly  in part because a large portion of our revenue in any quarter is attributable to product acceptance or license renewal by a relatively small number of customers 
fluctuations also reflect our policy of recognizing revenue upon product acceptance or  in the case of term licenses  license renewal 
customers often will not accept products until the end of a lengthy sales cycle and an implementation period  typically ranging from six to twelve months but in some cases significantly longer 
we recently introduced a new set of products based on our new pegarules technology 
in some cases  these new products have a shorter sales cycle and implementation period than our traditional product line 
however  our experience with these new products is limited in time  and we may experience longer sales and implementation cycles in some cases 
any increases in these cycles may adversely affect our financial performance  due in part to the recognition of sales staff and commission costs in advance of revenue recognition 
in addition  risks over which we have little or no control  including customers budgets  staffing allocation  and internal authorization reviews  can significantly affect the sales and acceptance cycles 
changes requested by customers may further delay product implementation and revenue recognition 
our quarterly operating results have varied considerably in the past and are likely to vary considerably in the future 
historically  most of our revenue in a quarter has been attributable to a small number of transactions 
this has caused our quarterly revenue to fluctuate  sometimes significantly 
these fluctuations could cause us to be unprofitable on an annual or quarterly basis and to fail to meet analysts expectations regarding our earnings or revenue 
our current strategy to rely more heavily on third party services in support of license sales may increase these fluctuations because we will have less control over the timing of customer acceptance of our software 
while future fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may be buffered to some extent by the increasing percentages of our total revenue from maintenance services and by an increase in the number of license transactions  we expect those fluctuations will continue to be significant at least in the near term 
we plan selling and marketing expenses  product development and other expenses based on anticipated future revenue 
if revenue falls below expectations  financial performance is likely to be adversely affected because only small portions of expenses vary with revenue 
as a result  period to period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon to predict future performance 
our stock price has been volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
factors that are difficult to predict  such as quarterly revenues and operating results  statements and ratings by financial analysts  and overall market performance  will have a significant effect on the price for shares of our common stock 
factors relating to our products and markets we will need to develop new products  evolve existing ones  and adapt to technology change 
technical developments  customer requirements  programming languages and industry standards change frequently in our markets 
as a result  success in current markets and new markets will depend upon our ability to enhance current products  to develop and introduce new products that meet customer needs  keep pace with technology changes  respond to competitive products  and achieve market acceptance 
product development requires substantial investments for research  refinement and testing 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make necessary product development investments 
we may experience difficulties that will delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or implementation of new or enhanced products 
inability to introduce or implement new or enhanced products in a timely manner would adversely affect future financial performance 
our products are complex and may contain errors 
errors in products will require us to ship corrected products to customers 
errors in products could cause the loss of or delay in market acceptance or sales and revenue  the diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs which would have an adverse effect on financial performance 
the market for our offerings is increasingly and intensely competitive  rapidly changing  and highly fragmented 
the market for business process management software and related implementation  consulting and training services is intensely competitive and highly fragmented 
we currently encounter significant competition from internal information systems departments of potential or existing customers that develop custom software 
we also compete with companies that target the customer interaction and workflow markets and professional service organizations that develop custom software in conjunction with rendering consulting services 
competition for market share and pressure to reduce prices and make sales concessions are likely to increase 
many competitors have far greater resources and may be able to respond more quickly and efficiently to new or emerging technologies  programming languages or standards or to changes in customer requirements or preferences 
competitors may also be able to devote greater managerial and financial resources to develop  promote and distribute products and provide related consulting and training services 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by us will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we have historically sold to the financial services and healthcare markets 
these markets are continuing to consolidate  and face uncertainty due to many other factors 
we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenue from customers in the financial services and healthcare markets  and increased sales to these markets are important for our future growth  although we have been increasing our sales to other markets 
competitive pressures  industry consolidation  decreasing operating margins within these markets  currency fluctuations  geographic expansion and deregulation affect the financial condition of our customers and their willingness to pay 
in addition  customers purchasing patterns are somewhat discretionary 
as a result  some or all of the factors listed above may adversely affect the demand by customers 
the financial services market is undergoing intense domestic and international consolidation 
consolidation may interrupt normal buying behaviors and increase the volatility of our operating results 
in recent years  several customers have been merged or consolidated 
future mergers or consolidations may cause a decline in revenues and adversely affect our future financial performance 
we rely on certain third party relationships 
we have a number of relationships with third parties that are significant to sales  marketing and support activities  and product development efforts 
we rely on relational database management system applications and development tool vendors  software and hardware vendors  large system integrators and technology consulting firms to provide marketing and sales opportunities for the direct sales force and to strengthen our products through the use of industry standard tools and utilities 
we also have relationships with third parties that distribute our products 
in particular  we benefit from our non exclusive relationship with first data resources for the distribution of products to the credit card market and with pfpc inc for distribution of products to the mutual fund market 
there can be no assurance that these companies  most of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources  will not develop or market products that compete with ours in the future or will not otherwise end their relationships with or support of us 
we face risks from operations and customers based outside of the us sales to customers headquartered outside of the united states represented approximately of our total revenue in  in  and in we  in part through our wholly owned subsidiaries based in the united kingdom  singapore  canada  and australia  market products and render consulting and training services to customers based in canada  the united kingdom  france  germany  the netherlands  belgium  switzerland  austria  ireland  sweden  south africa  mexico  australia  hong kong  and singapore 
we have established offices in continental europe and australia 
we believe that growth will necessitate expanded international operations requiring a diversion of managerial attention and financial resources 
we anticipate hiring additional personnel to accommodate international growth  and we may also enter into agreements with local distributors  representatives  or resellers 
if we are unable to do one or more of these things in a timely manner  our growth  if any  in our foreign operations will be restricted  and our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
most of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  any appreciation of the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of those countries in which we distribute our products may place us at a competitive disadvantage by effectively making our products more expensive as compared to those of our competitors 
additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  increased tariffs and other trade barriers  the costs of localizing products for local markets and complying with local business customs  longer accounts receivable patterns and difficulties in collecting foreign accounts receivable  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights  heightened risks of political and economic instability  the possibility of nationalization or expropriation of industries or properties  difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation  increased accounting and internal control expenses  and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our foreign operations  and  consequentially  our business  operating results  and financial condition 
factors relating to our internal operations and potential liabilities we depend on certain key personnel  and must be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
the business is dependent on a number of key  highly skilled technical  managerial  consulting  sales  and marketing personnel  including mr 
alan trefler  our chief executive officer 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect financial performance 
we do not have any significant key man life insurance on any officers or employees and do not plan to obtain any 
our success will depend in large part on the ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
the number of potential employees who have the extensive knowledge of computer hardware and operating systems needed to develop  sell and maintain our products is limited  and competition for their services is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
if we are unable to do so  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may face product liability and warranty claims 
our license agreements typically contain provisions intended to limit the nature and extent of our risk of product liability and warranty claims 
there is a risk that a court might interpret these terms in a limited way or could hold part or all of these terms to be unenforceable 
also  there is a risk that these contract terms might not bind a party other than the direct customer 
furthermore  some of our licenses with our customers are governed by non us law  and there is a risk that foreign law might give us less or different protection 
although we have not experienced any material product liability claims to date  a product liability suit or action claiming a breach of warranty  whether or not meritorious  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and our resources 
we face risks related to intellectual property claims or appropriation of our intellectual property rights 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secrets laws  as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
in october  we were granted a patent by the united states patent and trademark office relating to the architecture of our systems 
we cannot assure that such patent will not be invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted thereunder or the description contained therein will provide competitive advantages to our competitors or others 
moreover  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain the use of information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
we are not aware that any of our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
although we attempt to limit the amount and type of our contractual liability for infringement of the proprietary rights of third parties  these limitations often contain certain exclusions  and we cannot be assured that these limitations will be applicable and enforceable in all cases 
even if these limitations are found to be applicable and enforceable  our liability to our customers for these types of claims could be material in amount given the size of certain of our transactions 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results  and financial condition 
investor confidence and share value may be adversely impacted if our management is unable to provide an unqualified assessment regarding the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting  or if our independent auditors are unable to provide us with their attestation regarding our management s assessment  for our fiscal year or beyond  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of the securities and exchange commission  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in its annual reports on form k that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the company s independent auditors must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
for the year ended december   management s assessment is included on page of this annual report on form k and our independent auditors attestation is included on page of this annual report on form k 
these reports  however  speak only as of a single point in time 
for future periods  although we intend to diligently and regularly review and update our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the section requirements  our management may not be able to provide an unqualified assessment for our fiscal year or beyond  and our independent auditors may be unwilling to provide an attestation for any of these years 
any such event could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our shares 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in connection with such fluctuations 
foreign currency exposure we derived approximately of our total revenue in from sales to customers based outside of the united states 
some of our international sales are denominated in foreign currencies  such as the british pound and euro 
the price in united states dollars of products and services sold outside the united states in foreign currencies will vary as the value of the united states dollar fluctuates against those foreign currencies 
there can be no assurance that sales denominated in foreign currencies will not be material in the future and that there will not be increases in the value of the united states dollar against such currencies that will reduce the dollar return to us on the sale of our products and services in such foreign currencies 
the foreign currency exposure related to revenue is largely offset by the expenses we incur in foreign currencies 
we had net assets valued in foreign currencies  consisting primarily of cash  investments  license installments  and receivables  partially offset by accounts payable and accruals  with a carrying value of million as of december  a ten percent change in currency exchange rates would change by approximately million the carrying value of those net assets as reported on our balance sheet as of december   with most of that change recognized in the statement of income as other income expense 
interest rate exposure our balance sheet contains interest bearing assets which have fixed rates of interest 
these assets are license installments receivable generated in the normal course of business through transactions with customers and investments of excess cash in marketable debt securities 
license installments receivable bear interest at the rate in effect when the license revenue was recognized  which does not vary throughout the life of the contractual cash flow stream 
we believe that at current market interest rates  the fair value of license installments receivable approximates the carrying value as reported on our balance sheets 
however  there can be no assurance that the fair market value will approximate the carrying value in the future 
changes in market rates do not affect net earnings  as the license installments receivable are carried at cost and  since they are not financial instruments and are held until maturity  are not marked to market to reflect changes in the fair value of the portfolio 
factors such as increasing interest rates can reduce the fair market value of the license installments receivable 
the carrying value of million as of december  reflects the weighted average of historic discount rates used to record each term license arrangement 
the average rate changes with market rates as new license installments receivable are added to the portfolio  which mitigates exposure to market interest rate risk 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our license installments receivable by approximately million as of december we have invested in fixed rate marketable debt securities 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our marketable debt securities by approximately million as of december  changes in market rates and the related impact on fair value of the investments do not generally affect net earnings as our investments are fixed rate securities and are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
