item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the following discussion pertains to emmis communications corporation and its subsidiaries collectively  emmis or the company 
we own and operate radio  television and publishing properties located primarily in the united states 
our revenues are mostly affected by the advertising rates our entities charge  as advertising sales represent more than of our consolidated revenues 
these rates are in large part based on our entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
broadcast entities ratings are measured principally four times a year by arbitron radio market reports for radio stations and by ac nielsen company for television stations 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  our strategy is to use market research  advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are usually lowest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
our television division s revenues typically fluctuate from year to year due to political spending  which is the highest in our odd numbered fiscal years 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services  which can be used by the station in its business operations 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
the following table summarizes the sources of our revenues for each of the past three years 
the category non traditional principally consists of ticket sales and sponsorships of events our stations and magazines conduct in their local markets 
the category other includes  among other items  revenues generated by the websites of our entities and barter 
year ended february  of total of total of total net revenues local national political publication sales non traditional other total net revenues a significant portion of our expenses varies in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions  and bad debt 
our costs that do not vary as much in relation to revenue are mostly in our programming and general and administrative departments  such as talent costs  syndicated programming fees  utilities and office salaries 
lastly  our costs that are highly discretionary are costs in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience and market share 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that encompass significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially derive materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles under sfas no 
require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by macro economic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under sfas no 
to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  or to the extent that market values decrease 
allocations for purchased assets we typically engage an independent appraisal firm to value assets acquired in a material acquisition 
we use the appraisal report to allocate the purchase price of the acquisition among different categories of assets 
to the extent that purchased assets are not allocated appropriately  depreciation and amortization expense could be materially different 
deferred taxes and effective tax rates we estimate the effective tax rates and associated liabilities or assets for each legal entity in accordance with fas these estimates are based upon our interpretation of united states and local tax laws as they apply to our legal entities and our overall tax structure 
audits by local tax jurisdictions  including the united states government  could yield different interpretations from our own and cause the company to owe more taxes than originally recorded 
we utilize experts in the various tax jurisdictions to evaluate our position and to assist in our calculation of our tax expense and related liabilities 
the company evaluates on a quarterly basis its ability to realize its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to support realization of certain deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets 
insurance claims and loss reserves the company is self insured for most healthcare claims  subject to stop loss limits 
claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on historical experience and industry trends  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
the company also maintains large deductible programs ranging from thousand to thousand per occurrence for workers compensation claims  automotive liability losses and media liability 
valuation of stock options the company determines the fair value of its employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different than these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
the company has used historical data for its stock price and option life when determining expected volatility and expected term  but each year the company reassesses whether or not historical data is representative of expected results 
acquisitions  dispositions and investments during the three year period ended february   we acquired one television station  nine international radio stations in belgium  and a controlling interest in six domestic radio stations for an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
we also disposed of two domestic radio stations two international radio stations and one television production company and we exchanged three domestic radio stations for one domestic radio station  collectively receiving cash proceeds of million 
a recap of the transactions completed during the three years ended february  is summarized hereafter 
these transactions impact the comparability of operating results year over year 

table of contents on january   emmis completed its exchange with bonneville international corporation bonneville whereby emmis swapped three of its radio stations in phoenix ktar am  kmvp am and kklt fm for bonneville s wlup fm located in chicago and million in cash including payments for working capital items 
emmis used the cash to repay amounts outstanding under its senior credit facility 
emmis has long sought a second radio station in chicago to complement its existing station in the market  wkqx fm 
this transaction achieves that goal by marrying the heritage alternative rock format wkqx with the heritage classic rock format wlup 
emmis began programming wlup fm and bonneville began programming ktar am  kmvp am and kklt fm under time brokerage agreements on december  the assets and liabilities of the three radio stations in phoenix and their results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these three radio stations had historically been included in the radio reporting segment 
the company recorded million of goodwill associated with the asset swap  but none of this goodwill is deductible for tax purposes 
on may   emmis sold to its minority partners for million in cash its entire interest in votionis  sa votionis  which owns and operates two radio stations in buenos aires  argentina 
in connection with the sale  emmis recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million in fiscal in fiscal  emmis recorded income from discontinued operations of million  consisting of operational losses of million  offset by tax benefits of million 
the argentine peso substantially devalued relative to the us dollar early in the million loss in fiscal was primarily attributable to the devaluation of the peso and resulting non cash write off of cumulative currency translation adjustments 
votionis had historically been included in the radio reporting segment 
on december   the flemish government awarded licenses to operate nine fm radio stations in the flanders region of belgium to several not for profit entities that have granted emmis the exclusive right to provide the programming and sell the advertising on the stations for the duration that the not for profit entities retain the licenses 
five of these licenses are for the stations that emmis began programming in august and the remaining four related to new stations that emmis began operating in may the licenses and emmis exclusive right are for an initial term of nine years and do not require the payment of any license fees to the flemish government 
on july   emmis effectively acquired a controlling interest of in a partnership that owns six radio stations in the austin  texas metropolitan area for a cash purchase price of approximately million  including transaction costs of million 
these six stations are klbj am  klbj fm  kdht fm  formerly kxmg fm  krox fm  kgsr fm and keyi fm 
this acquisition allowed emmis to diversify its radio portfolio and participate in another large  high growth radio market 
the acquisition was financed through borrowings under the credit facility and was accounted for as a purchase 
the company recorded million of goodwill  all of which is deductible for income tax purposes 
in addition  emmis has the option  but not the obligation  to purchase its partner s entire interest in the partnership after a period of approximately five years from the acquisition date based on an multiple of trailing month cash flow 
effective march   emmis completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of television station wbpg tv in mobile  al pensacola  fl from pegasus communications corporation for approximately million  including transaction costs of million 
we financed the acquisition through borrowings under the credit facility  and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
this acquisition allowed us to achieve duopoly efficiencies in the market  such as lower programming acquisition costs and consolidation of general and administrative functions  since we already owned a television station in the market  wala 
effective may  emmis completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of kalc fm in denver  colorado to entercom communications corporation for million 
emmis had purchased kalc fm on january   from salem communications corporation for million in cash plus a commitment fee of million and transaction related costs of million 
on february   emmis entered into a definitive agreement to sell kalc fm to entercom and entercom began operating kalc fm under a time brokerage agreement on march  proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
since the agreed upon sales price for this station was less than its carrying amount as of february   we recognized an impairment loss of million in fiscal additionally  in fiscal we recorded an incremental million loss in connection with the sale  which is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
effective may  emmis completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of kxpk fm in denver  colorado to entravision communications corporation for million

table of contents typically monitor the performance of our stations against the aggregate performance of the markets in which we operate based on reports for the periods prepared by the independent accounting firm miller  kaplan  arase co  llp miller  kaplan 
for the year ended february   on a pro forma basis  net revenues of our domestic radio stations were up  whereas miller  kaplan reported that net revenues of our domestic radio markets were up 
the pro forma effect of including wlup in our results reduced our domestic radio growth by 
still  we believe we were able to outperform the markets in which we operate due to our commitment to training and developing local sales forces  as well as higher ratings driven by our continued investment in quality on air personalities and format revisions 
the higher ratings allowed us to charge higher rates for the advertisements we sold 
our advertising inventory sellout percentage decreased slightly year over year 
the increase in television net revenues for the year ended february  is principally due to a substantial increase in net political revenues  as there were more political election campaigns in our fiscal than there were in our fiscal net political advertising revenues for fiscal and were approximately million and million  respectively 
excluding political net revenues  we exceeded the average local revenue growth of our markets in fiscal we believe our commitment to training and developing local sales forces has contributed to our local revenue share growth 
in fiscal  our television stations sold a higher percentage of their inventory and charged higher rates for the inventory sold due to ratings improvements at our stations and strong demand in several of our markets  primarily the result of political advertisements 
our publishing division has experienced slow  steady growth  as our magazines are generally mature properties with limited direct competition

in all other respects  the stock compensation program remains comparable to the stock compensation programs in effect for each of the last two calendar years 
effective january   we further curtailed our stock compensation program by eliminating mandatory participation for employees making less than  per year 
for calendar  this change is expected to result in an estimated million decrease in the company s noncash compensation expense and a corresponding increase in the company s cash operating expense 
no formal decisions have been made regarding the stock compensation program s status beyond december as a result of the modifications to our stock compensation programs for calendar and  the noncash compensation expense of the stock compensation program decreased approximately million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the remaining decrease of million is primarily attributable to a higher portion of bonuses and incentive awards being paid in cash at the election of the company as opposed to being paid in the form of stock in the prior periods 
on march   emmis granted approximately  shares of restricted stock to certain of its employees in lieu of stock options  which significantly reduced the company s annual stock option grant

table of contents television operating income increased due to substantially higher net revenues  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
in fiscal there were many more political elections than the prior fiscal year 
in addition  our television stations have collectively gained market revenue share as they monetize higher station ratings 
accordingly  our television operating income was substantially higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal however  given that our political advertising net revenues will be significantly lower in our next fiscal year  we expect our television operating income to be lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal publishing operating income increased slightly 
as previously stated  our publishing division has experienced slow  steady growth as our magazines are generally mature properties with limited direct competition 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we initiated the launch of a new magazine targeting acculturated  bilingual  affluent hispanics in los angeles  with the first issue expected to be released in our quarter ended may  we expect to incur approximately million of operating losses in our fiscal related to this new venture

the company does not have any majority owned and controlled subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements  nor does the company have any interests in or relationships with any special purpose entities that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements or disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
summary disclosures about contractual cash obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of february  payments due by period amounts in thousands less than to to after total year years years years contractual cash obligations long term debt operating leases tv program rights payable future tv program rights payable radio broadcast agreements purchase obligations employment agreements total contractual cash obligations tv program rights payable represents payments to be made to various program syndicators and distributors in accordance with current contracts for the rights to broadcast programs 
future tv program rights payable represents commitments for program rights not available for broadcast as of february  includes contractual commitments to purchase goods and services  including audience measurement information  network affiliation fees and music license fees 
certain of our network affiliation fees are variable based on the financial and or ratings performance of the station or network 
amounts included above are estimates based on current performance projected through the life of the corresponding affiliation agreement 
we expect to fund these payments primarily with cash flows from operations  but we may also issue additional debt or equity or sell assets 

table of contents sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and cash available through revolving loan borrowings under our credit facility 
our primary uses of capital have been historically  and are expected to continue to be  capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  funding acquisitions and preferred stock dividend requirements 
since we manage cash on a consolidated basis  any cash needs of a particular segment or operating entity are met by intercompany transactions 
see investing activities below for discussion of specific segment needs 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million 
the increase in net working capital primarily relates to the repayment of million of senior debt classified as current as of february  with the proceeds from our radio station asset exchange with bonneville 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended february   compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended february   as compared to the same period in the prior year  is due to our increase in net revenues less station operating expenses and corporate expenses  including an increase of approximately million in net political revenues in the current year 
cash flows provided by operating activities are historically the highest in our third and fourth fiscal quarters  as a significant portion of our accounts receivable collections is derived from revenues recognized in our second and third fiscal quarters  which are our highest revenue quarters 
investing activities cash flows provided by investing activities were million for the year ended february   compared to cash used in investing activities of million in the same period of the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to cash received from the sale of two international radio stations and cash received in connection with an exchange of domestic radio stations in the year ended february  as opposed to our purchase of radio stations in the year ended february  investing activities include capital expenditures and business acquisitions and dispositions 
as discussed in results of operations above and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  on january   emmis closed on its exchange of three radio stations in phoenix for million in cash and one radio station in chicago 
on may   emmis sold to its minority partners for million in cash its interest in votionis  sa  which owns and operates two radio stations in buenos aires  argentina 
the proceeds from both transactions were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
on july   emmis effectively acquired a controlling interest of in a partnership that owns six radio stations in the austin  texas metropolitan area for a cash purchase price of approximately million  including transaction costs of million  all of which was funded with borrowings under the credit facility 
in the years ended february   and  we had capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to leasehold improvements to various office and studio facilities  broadcast equipment purchases  tower upgrades and costs associated with our conversion to digital television 
we expect that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business and digital conversion upgrade costs 
although all but one of our television stations as of april were broadcasting a digital signal  we expect to incur approximately million of costs in our fiscal  million in our fiscal and million beyond fiscal through the end of the digital transition to upgrade the digital transmission facilities of our local television stations and satellite stations  and to accommodate the channel changes required by the fcc s second periodic review 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
emmis recently entered into an agreement with ibiquity digital corporation to employ high definition hd radio technology at seventeen of our radio stations over the next three years 
under the agreement  the company incurred approximately million to implement hd radio at two of our stations in fiscal and expects to incur approximately million beyond fiscal to convert 
table of contents the remaining fifteen stations 
amounts related to our digital radio build out are included in contractual cash obligations under the heading purchase obligations 
financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended february  cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the same period of the prior year 
on may   emmis refinanced substantially all of its long term debt 
emmis received million in proceeds from the issuance of its senior subordinated notes due in the principal amount of million  net of the initial purchasers discount of million  and borrowed million under a new billion senior credit facility 
the gross proceeds from these transactions and million of cash on hand were used to i repay the million remaining principal indebtedness under its former credit facility  ii repurchase million aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated notes due  iii repurchase million aggregate accreted value of its senior discount notes due  iv pay million in accrued interest  v pay million in transaction fees and vi pay million in prepayment and redemption fees 
on may   emmis gave notice to redeem the remaining million of principal amount of its senior subordinated notes due these notes were redeemed on june  at plus accrued and unpaid interest and the redemption was financed with additional borrowings on our new credit facility 
the transaction resulted in an additional loss on debt extinguishment of million  which emmis recorded in its quarter ended august  the new senior credit facility provides for total borrowings of up to billion  including i a million term loan and ii a million revolver  of which million may be used for letters of credit 
the new senior credit facility also provides for the ability to have incremental facilities of up to million  of which up to million may be allocated to a revolver 
emmis may access the incremental facility on one or more occasions  subject to certain provisions  including a potential market adjustment to pricing of the entire credit facility 
all outstanding amounts under the new credit facility bear interest  at the option of emmis  at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate or an alternative base rate as defined in the new credit facility plus a margin 
the margin over the eurodollar rate or the alternative base rate varies under the revolver ranging from to  depending on emmis ratio of debt to consolidated operating cash flow  as defined in the agreement 
the margins over the eurodollar rate or the alternative base rate are and  respectively  for the term loan facility 
interest is due on a calendar quarter basis under the alternative base rate and at least every three months under the eurodollar rate 
beginning one year after closing  the new credit facility requires emmis to maintain fixed interest rates  for at least a two year period  on a minimum of of its total outstanding debt  as defined including the senior subordinated debt  but excluding the senior discount notes 
this ratio of fixed to floating rate debt must be maintained if emmis total leverage ratio  as defined  is greater than at any quarter end 
both the term loan and revolver mature on november  the borrowings due under the term loan are payable in equal quarterly installments in an annual amount equal to of the term loan during each of the first six and one quarter years of the loan beginning on february   with the remaining balance payable november  on august   emmis exchanged the million aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated notes for a new series of notes registered under the securities act 
the terms of the new series of notes were substantially the same as the terms of the senior subordinated notes 
the notes have no sinking fund requirement and are due in full on may  interest is payable semi annually on may and november of each year 
prior to may   emmis may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at a price of of the principal amount thereof plus the payment of a make whole premium 
after may   emmis can choose to redeem some or all of the notes at specified redemption prices ranging from to plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on or after may   the notes may be redeemed at plus accrued and unpaid interest 
upon a change of control as defined  emmis is required to make an offer to purchase the notes then outstanding at a purchase price equal to plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the payment of principal  premium and interest on the notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  by emmis and most of emmis existing wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the new credit facility 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in april  emmis completed the sale of million shares of its class a common stock at per share resulting in total proceeds of million 
fifty percent of the net proceeds were used in april to repay outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
the remainder was invested  and in july used to redeem approximately of our million  face value  senior discount notes see discussion below 
as indicated in investing activities above  we paid million on july  for a controlling interest in six radio stations in austin  
table of contents texas 
these funds were borrowed under our senior credit facility 
also  net proceeds of million from the sale of two radio stations in denver were also used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility during the year ended february  as of february   emmis had  million of long term corporate indebtedness outstanding under its credit facility million  senior subordinated notes million  senior discount notes million and an additional million of other long term indebtedness 
emmis also had million of convertible preferred stock outstanding 
all outstanding amounts under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate or an alternative base rate plus a margin 
as of february   our weighted average borrowing rate under our credit facility was approximately  and our overall weighted average borrowing rate  after taking into account amounts outstanding under our senior subordinated notes and senior discount notes  was approximately 
emmis has incurred significant debt as a result of numerous acquisitions in our radio  television and publishing divisions since these acquisitions were financed primarily with debt as the company did not want to dilute the ownership of its common shareholders 
the company has repaid approximately million of debt  net of new borrowings  since march with the proceeds from stock sales  station sales and cash from operations 
the company expects to continue to use its significant cash flows from operations to primarily repay outstanding debt obligations 
under the terms of emmis credit facility  our total consolidated debt to ebitda leverage ratio was x as of february   and the maximum debt to ebitda leverage ratio permitted under our credit facility was x as of february  the debt service requirements of emmis over the next twelve month period net of interest under our credit facility are expected to be million 
this amount is comprised of million for interest under our senior subordinated notes  million for repayment of term notes under our credit facility and million in preferred stock dividend requirements 
although interest will be paid under the credit facility at least every three months  the amount of interest is not presently determinable given that the credit facility bears interest at variable rates 
the terms of emmis preferred stock provide for a quarterly dividend payment of 
per share on each january  april  july and october on march   we acquired a national radio network in slovakia for approximately million  which was financed with borrowings under our credit facility 
at april   we had million available under our credit facility  net of million in outstanding letters of credit and exclusive of term b loan mandatory repayments of up to million see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio and television stations  as well as publishing properties 
if we elect to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities  we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity or debt securities  depending on market conditions and other factors 
in addition  emmis has the option  but not the obligation  to purchase our minority partner s entire interest in six radio stations in austin  texas after a period of approximately five years from the acquisition date based on an multiple of trailing month cash flow 
on may   emmis announced that it has engaged advisors to assist in evaluating strategic alternatives for the company s television assets 
this process could result in a decision to sell all or a portion of its television assets 
on may   emmis also announced that its board of directors approved a dutch auction tender offer to purchase up to  shares of its class a common stock at a price per share not less than and not greater than 
the purchase will be financed from a combination of new borrowings under emmis existing credit facility and new financing 
as a result  the tender offer will be subject to the receipt of debt financing on terms and conditions satisfactory to emmis  in its reasonable judgment  in an amount sufficient to purchase the class a shares in the tender offer and to pay related fees and expenses 
in addition  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to be made effective after the completion of the tender offer 
the share repurchase program would permit emmis  to the extent that it does not purchase  class a shares in the tender offer  to purchase up to a number of class a shares equal to the shortfall plus an additional number of class a shares equal to of the total outstanding shares after the tender offer 
whether or to what extent emmis chooses to make such purchases will depend upon market conditions and emmis capital needs  and there is no assurance that emmis will conclude such purchases for any or all of the authorized amounts remaining 

table of contents intangibles at february   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  subscription lists and similar assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio and television stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations for compliance with regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all of our fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards  including employee stock options  using a fair value method and record such expense in their consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
r requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas no 
r was expected to be effective as of september  for emmis  but the sec recently delayed the effective date  and it is now expected to be effective as of march  for emmis 
we expect the adoption of this accounting pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial results 
the historical effect of this accounting pronouncement on our stock options for the years ended february  and is presented in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on september   the eitf issued topic d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill 
for all of the company s acquisitions completed prior to its adoption of sfas no 
on june   the company allocated a portion of the purchase price to the acquisition s tangible assets in accordance with a third party appraisal  with the remainder of the purchase price being allocated to the fcc license 
this allocation method is commonly called the residual method and results in all of the acquisition s intangible assets  including goodwill  being included in the company s fcc license value 
although the company has directly valued the fcc license of stations acquired since its adoption of sfas no 
 the company had retained the use of the residual method to perform its annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas no 
for acquisitions effected prior to the adoption of sfas no 
eitf topic d prohibits the use of the residual method and precludes companies from reclassifying to goodwill any goodwill that was originally included in the value of the fcc license  resulting in a write off 
implementation of eitf topic d was required no later than emmis fiscal year ending february   but the company elected to adopt it as of december  and recorded a noncash charge of million  net of tax  in its fourth quarter as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
this loss has no impact on the company s cash flows or compliance with its debt covenants 
since its adoption of sfas no 
on march   the company no longer amortizes goodwill for financial statement purposes 
accordingly  reported and pro forma results reflecting the impact of this accounting pronouncement are the same for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on january   the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin addresses consolidation of business enterprises which are variable interest entities 
fin was effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after january  and for the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company has not acquired any variable interest entities subsequent to january  and has no interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
the company adopted fin in its quarter ended may   and the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
seasonality our results of operations are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations  which result in higher second and third quarter revenues and operating income 
for our radio operations  this seasonality is due to the younger demographic composition of many of our stations 
advertisers increase spending during the summer months to target these listeners 
in addition  advertisers generally increase spending across all of our segments during the months of october and november  which are part of our third quarter  in anticipation of the holiday season 
finally  particularly in our television operations  revenues from political advertising tend to be higher in our odd numbered fiscal years 

table of contents inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on our operating results  particularly since our senior bank debt is entirely floating rate debt 
risk factors the risk factors listed below  in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report  could affect the business and future results of the company 
past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
decreased spending by advertisers or a decrease in our market ratings or market share can adversely affect our advertising revenues 
we believe that advertising is a discretionary business expense 
spending on advertising tends to decline disproportionately during an economic recession or downturn as compared to other types of business spending 
consequently  the recent downturn in the united states economy had an adverse effect on our advertising revenue and  therefore  our results of operations 
a recession or another downturn in the united states economy or in the economy of any individual geographic market  particularly a major market such as los angeles  new york or orlando  in which we own and operate sizeable stations  could have a significant effect on us 
even in the absence of a general recession or downturn in the economy  an individual business sector that tends to spend more on advertising than other sectors might be forced to reduce its advertising expenditures if that sector experiences a downturn 
if that sector s spending represents a significant portion of our advertising revenues  any reduction in its advertising expenditures may affect our revenue 
in addition  since political advertising at times accounts for a significant portion of our advertising revenues  normal election cycles may cause our revenues to fluctuate 
changes in government limitations on spending or fundraising for campaign advertisements may also have a negative effect on our earnings derived from political advertising 
we may lose audience share and advertising revenue to competing television and radio stations or other types of media competitors 
we operate in highly competitive industries 
our television and radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other television and radio stations and station groups  as well as with other media 
shifts in population  demographics  audience tastes and other factors beyond our control could cause us to lose market share 
any adverse change in a particular market  or adverse change in the relative market positions of the stations located in a particular market  could have a material adverse effect on our revenue or ratings  could require increased promotion or other expenses in that market  and could adversely affect our revenue in other markets 
other television and radio broadcasting companies may enter the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
our television and radio stations may not be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenue in the face of such competition 
in addition  from time to time  other stations may change their format or programming  a new station may adopt a format to compete directly with our stations for audiences and advertisers  or stations might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns 
these tactics could result in lower ratings and advertising revenue or increased promotion and other expenses and  consequently  lower earnings and cash flow for us 
any failure by us to respond  or to respond as quickly as our competitors  could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
because of the competitive factors we face  we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain or increase our current audience ratings and advertising revenue 

table of contents we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the television and radio broadcasting industries are subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of competition from new media technologies and services 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
various new media technologies and services are being developed or introduced  including satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of new subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous niche formats  audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  personal communications systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  mp players and other personal audio systems that create new ways for individuals to listen to music and other content of their own choosing  in band on channel digital radio  which provides multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  low power fm radio  which could result in additional fm radio broadcast outlets  and digital video recorders that allow viewers to digitally record and play back television programming  which may decrease viewership of commercials and  as a result  lower our advertising revenues 
in addition  cable providers and direct broadcast satellite companies are developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences  reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized niche markets 
competitors who target programming to such sharply defined markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues 
lowering the cost of creating channels may also encourage new competitors to enter our markets and compete with us for advertising revenue 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have on the television and radio broadcasting industries or on our financial condition and results of operations 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
at february   our total indebtedness was approximately  million  and our shareholders equity was approximately million 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates because some of our debt is at variable rates of interest  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and 
table of contents limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our credit facility and our other debt instruments  our ability to borrow additional funds 
failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default  which if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 
the terms of our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our direct and indirect subsidiaries may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or to take some actions 
our credit facility and our bond indenture impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  issue preferred stock  incur liens  pay dividends  enter into asset sale transactions  merge or consolidate with another company  dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or make certain other payments or investments 
these restrictions currently limit our ability to grow our business through acquisitions and could limit our ability to respond to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs 
they also could restrict our corporate activities in other ways 
these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 
to service our indebtedness and other obligations  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness  to pay dividends and to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this ability to generate cash  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
our businesses might not generate sufficient cash flow from operations 
we might not be able to complete future offerings  and future borrowings might not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot assure investors that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our operating results have been and may again be adversely affected by acts of war and terrorism 
acts of war and terrorism against the united states  and the country s response to such acts  may negatively affect the us advertising market  which could cause our advertising revenues to decline due to advertising cancellations  delays or defaults in payment for advertising time  and other factors 
in addition  these events may have other negative effects on our business  the nature and duration of which we cannot predict 
for example  the war in iraq caused the networks to pre empt regularly scheduled programming in the last month of the first quarter of fiscal and caused several advertisers to cancel their advertising spots  resulting in a loss of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal after the september  terrorist attacks  we decided that the public interest would be best served by the presentation of continuous commercial free coverage of the unfolding events on our stations 
this temporary policy had a material adverse effect on our advertising revenues and operating results for the month of september future events like those of september  or the war in iraq may cause us to adopt similar policies  which could have a material adverse effect on our advertising revenues and operating results 
additionally  the attacks on the world trade center on september  resulted in the destruction of the transmitter facilities that were located there 
although we had no transmitter facilities located at the world trade center  broadcasters that had facilities located in the destroyed buildings experienced temporary disruptions in their ability to broadcast 
since we tend to locate transmission facilities for stations serving urban areas on tall buildings or other significant structures  such as the empire state building in new york  further terrorist attacks or other disasters could cause similar disruptions in our broadcasts in the areas affected 
if these disruptions occur  we may not be able to locate adequate replacement facilities in a cost effective or timely manner or at all 
failure to remedy disruptions caused by terrorist attacks or other disasters and any resulting degradation in signal coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents television programming costs may negatively impact our operating results 
one of our most significant operating cost components is television programming 
we may be exposed in the future to increased programming costs which may adversely affect our operating results 
acquisitions of program rights are usually made two or three years in advance and may require multi year commitments  making it difficult to accurately predict how a program will perform 
in some instances  programs must be replaced before their costs have been fully amortized  resulting in write offs that increase station operating costs 
in addition  we have recently experienced increased competition to acquire programming  primarily due to the increased acquisition of syndicated programming by cable operators 
our television stations depend on affiliations with major networks that may be canceled or revoked by the networks 
all of our television stations are affiliated with a network 
under the affiliation agreements  the networks possess  under certain circumstances  the right to terminate the agreement without giving the station enough advance notice to implement a contingency plan 
the affiliation agreements may not remain in place  and the networks may not continue to provide programming to affiliates on the same basis that currently exists 
the non renewal or termination of any of our stations network affiliation agreements could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the success of our television stations depends on the success of the network each station carries 
the ratings of each of the television networks  which is based in large part on their programming  vary from year to year  and this variation can significantly impact a station s revenues 
the future success of any network or its programming is unpredictable 
to continue to grow our business  we will require significant additional capital 
the continued development  growth and operation of our businesses will require substantial capital 
in particular  additional acquisitions will require large amounts of capital 
we intend to fund our growth  including acquisitions  if any  with cash generated from operations  borrowings under our new credit facility and proceeds from future issuances of debt and equity both public and private 
our ability to raise additional debt or equity financing is subject to market conditions  our financial condition and other factors 
if we cannot obtain financing on acceptable terms when needed  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
our ability to grow through acquisitions may be limited by competition for suitable properties or other factors we cannot control 
we intend to selectively pursue acquisitions of radio and television stations and publishing properties  when appropriate  in order to grow 
to be successful with this strategy  we must be effective at quickly evaluating markets  obtaining financing to buy stations and publishing properties on satisfactory terms and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals  including  as discussed below  approvals of the fcc and the department of justice 
we also must accomplish these tasks at reasonable costs 
the radio industry in particular has rapidly consolidated 
in general  we compete with many other buyers for radio and television stations as well as publishing properties 
these other buyers may be larger and have more resources 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in buying stations or publishing properties  or whether we will be successful with any station or publishing property we acquire 
our strategy is generally to buy underperforming properties and use our experience to improve their performance 
thus  the benefits resulting from the properties we buy may not manifest themselves immediately  and we may need to pay large initial costs for these improvements 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approval for future acquisitions  our growth may be impaired 
although part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional radio and television stations  we may not be able to complete all the acquisitions that we agree to make 
station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
also  the fcc sometimes undertakes review of transactions to determine whether they would result in excessive concentration  even where the transaction complies with the numerical ownership limits 
specifically  the staff has had a policy of flagging for closer scrutiny the anticompetitive impact of any transactions that will put one owner in a position to earn or more of the market s radio advertising revenues or will result in the two largest owners receiving or more of those revenues 
while the fcc has noted flagging in public notices in the past  current transactions may be flagged internally by the fcc without public 
table of contents notice 
as discussed below  the fcc s new rules with respect to media ownership are under court review 
we cannot predict how the fcc s approval process will change based on the outcome of the fcc s media ownership proceeding or whether such changes would adversely impact us 
additionally  since the passage of the telecommunications act of  the us department of justice has become more involved in reviewing proposed acquisitions of radio stations and radio station networks 
the justice department is particularly concerned when the proposed buyer already owns one or more radio stations in the market of the station it is seeking to buy 
recently  the justice department has challenged a number of radio broadcasting transactions 
some of those challenges ultimately resulted in consent decrees requiring  among other things  divestitures of certain stations 
in general  the justice department has more closely scrutinized radio broadcasting acquisitions that result in local market shares in excess of of radio advertising revenue 
we may not be able to integrate acquired stations successfully  which could affect our financial performance 
our ability to operate our company effectively depends  in part  on our success in integrating acquired stations into our operations 
these efforts may impose significant strains on our management and financial resources 
the pursuit and integration of acquired stations will require substantial attention from our management and will limit the amount of time they can devote to other important matters 
successful integration of acquired stations will depend primarily on our ability to manage our combined operations 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquired stations or manage our growth or if we encounter unexpected difficulties during expansion  it could have a negative impact on the performance of acquired stations as well as on our company as a whole 
an accounting principle that affects the accounting treatment of goodwill and fcc licenses could cause future losses due to asset impairment 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets  including broadcast licenses 
under sfas  goodwill and some indefinite lived intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually  with impairment being measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible over its fair value 
in addition  goodwill and intangible assets will be tested more often for impairment as circumstances warrant 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and will be measured for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
after initial adoption  any impairment losses under sfas or will be recorded as operating expenses 
in connection with the adoption of sfas effective march   we recorded an impairment loss of million  net of tax  reflected as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the adoption of this accounting standard reduced our amortization of goodwill and intangibles by approximately million in the year ended february  we also incurred a million impairment loss in the fiscal year ended february  as a result of our annual sfas review 
although we did not recognize any impairment losses in the year ended february  related to sfas  our future impairment reviews could result in additional write downs 
one shareholder controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock  and his interest may conflict with investors 
as of april   our chairman of the board of directors  chief executive officer and president  jeffrey h 
smulyan  beneficially owned shares representing approximately of the outstanding combined voting power of all classes of our common stock  as calculated pursuant to rule d of the exchange act 
he therefore is in a position to exercise substantial influence over the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders  including the election of directors 
the fcc has recently begun more vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the fcc s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of am and am broadcasters risk violating the prohibition on the broadcast of indecent material because of the fcc s broad definition of such material  coupled with the spontaneity of live programming 

table of contents recently  the fcc has begun more vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry as a whole 
two congressional committees have recently conducted hearings relating to indecency 
legislation has also been introduced in congress that would increase the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming  and depending on the number of violations engaged in  would automatically subject broadcasters to license revocation  renewal or qualifications proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material 
the fcc has indicated that it is stepping up its enforcement activities as they apply to indecency  and has threatened to initiate license revocation proceedings against broadcast licensees for future serious indecency violations 
the fcc has found on a number of occasions recently  chiefly with regard to radio stations  that the content of broadcasts has contained indecent material 
the fcc issued fines to the offending licensees 
moreover  the fcc has recently begun imposing separate fines for each allegedly indecent utterance  in contrast with its previous policy  which generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation 
in august of  emmis entered into a consent decree with the fcc  pursuant to which i the company adopted a compliance plan intended to avoid future indecency violations  ii the company admitted  solely for purposes of the decree  that certain prior broadcasts were indecent  iii the company agreed to make a voluntary payment of  to the us treasury  iv the fcc rescinded its prior enforcement actions against the company based on allegedly indecent broadcasts and agreed not to use against the company any indecency violations based on complaints within the fcc s possession as of the date of the decree or similar complaints based on pre decree broadcasts  and v the fcc found that neither the alleged indecency violations nor the circumstances surrounding a civil suit filed by a wkqx announcer raised any substantial and material questions concerning the company s qualifications to hold fcc licenses 
a petition requesting that the fcc reconsider its approval of the decree has been filed and remains pending 
if the petition were to be granted by the fcc  or if a court appeal were taken and the court were to invalidate the decree  then any indecent broadcasts that may have occurred on the company s stations could be considered by the fcc  which could have an adverse impact on the company s fcc licenses 
in addition  petitions have been filed against the license renewal applications of stations wkqx and kpnt  and an informal objection has been filed against the license renewals of the company s indiana radio stations  in each case based primarily on the matters covered by the decree 
consequently  any invalidation of the decree could result in the petitions and objections being considered in connection with those and possibly other license renewals 
the communications act provides that the fcc must renew a broadcast license if i the station involved has served the public interest  convenience and necessity and ii there have been no serious violations of the act or fcc rules  and no other violations of the act or rules which taken together  would constitute a pattern of abuse 
if the commission were to determine that indecency or other violations by one or more of our stations fall within either or both of those definitions  the agency could x grant the license renewal applications of the stations with burdensome conditions  such as requirements for periodic reports  y grant the applications for less than the full eight year term in order to allow an early reassessment of the stations  or z order an evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge to determine whether renewal of the stations licenses should be denied 
if a station s license renewal were ultimately denied  the station would be required to cease operation permanently 
as a result of these developments  we have implemented measures to reduce the risk of broadcasting indecent material in violation of the fcc s rules 
these and other future modifications to our programming to reduce the risk of indecency violations could have an adverse effect on our competitive position 
legislation is pending in congress which would  among other things  i increase very substantially the fines for indecent broadcasts  ii specify that all indecency violations are serious violations for license renewal purposes and iii mandate an evidentiary hearing on the license renewal application of any station that has had three indecency violations during its license term 
our need to comply with comprehensive  complex and sometimes unpredictable federal regulations could have an adverse effect on our businesses 
we are dependent on licenses from the fcc  which regulates the radio and television broadcasting industries in the united states 
the radio and television broadcasting industries in the united states are subject to extensive and changing regulation by the fcc 
among other things  the fcc is responsible for the following assigning frequency bands for broadcasting  determining the particular frequencies  locations and operating power of stations  issuing  renewing  revoking and modifying station licenses  
table of contents determining whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses  regulating equipment used by stations  and adopting and implementing regulations and policies that directly affect the ownership  operation  programming and employment practices of stations 
the fcc has the power to impose penalties for violation of its rules or the applicable statutes 
while in the vast majority of cases licenses are renewed by the fcc  we cannot be sure that any of our united states stations licenses will be renewed at their expiration date 
even if our licenses are renewed  we cannot be sure that the fcc will not impose conditions or qualifications that could cause problems in our businesses 
the fcc regulations and policies also affect our growth strategy because the fcc has specific regulations and policies about the number of stations  including radio and television stations  and daily newspapers that an entity may own in any geographic area 
as a result of these rules  we may not be able to acquire more properties in some markets or  on the other hand  we may have to sell some of our properties in a particular market 
for example  as a result of our acquisition of lee enterprises in october  we own two top rated television stations in the honolulu market  which is not permitted by fcc rules 
as a result  we have been operating both stations under various temporary waivers to the fcc s ownership rules 
the fcc has adopted new local television ownership rules which continue to prohibit the ownership of two top rated television stations in a single market  and in so doing the fcc ordered companies with temporary waivers including us to file divesting applications to achieve compliance 
however  the implementation of the new rules has been appealed in federal court by a number of broadcasters including us and other groups  and the court has issued an indefinite stay  which has prevented the new rules from becoming effective 
we cannot predict when or how the court will rule on the appeal 
when and if the stay is lifted  we will likely have to either file a divesting application or seek a permanent waiver of the new rules 
if we are required to divest a station on short notice  we may not realize the full value of that station 
jeffrey h 
smulyan s voting interest in the company has fallen below for fcc control purposes 
the fcc does not take into account stock options exercisable within days as does exchange act rule d as a result  the company is no longer eligible for an exemption from the fcc s ownership attribution rules 
therefore  the media interests of minority shareholders who have voting interests in the company of or more or more in the case of certain categories of institutional investors will be attributed to us 
attribution of minority shareholders media interests to us could materially and adversely affect our business as a result of the increased cost of regulatory compliance and monitoring activities  the increased obstacles to our growth strategy or the mandatory divestment of our properties 
further  though we obtained fcc approval for the reduction in mr 
smulyan s voting interest  we may need to seek additional approval prior to further material reductions in his interest 
fcc regulations also limit the ability of non us persons to own our capital stock and to participate in our affairs  which could limit our ability to raise equity 
our articles of incorporation contain provisions which place restrictions on the ownership  voting and transfer of our capital stock in accordance with the law 
a court decision invalidated an fcc rule that prohibited common ownership of a broadcast station and a cable television system in the same market 
the elimination of that restriction could increase the amount of competition that our television stations face 
finally  a number of federal rules governing broadcasting have changed significantly in recent years and additional changes may occur  particularly with respect to the rules governing digital television  digital audio broadcasting  satellite radio services  multiple ownership and attribution 
we cannot predict the effect that these regulatory changes may ultimately have on our operations 
any changes in current fcc ownership regulations may negatively impact our ability to compete or otherwise harm our business operations 
in june of  the fcc substantially modified its rules governing ownership of broadcast stations 
the new rules i increase to the national cap on the number of television stations that can be owned nationwide by an entity or affiliated group  ii generally permit common ownership of two television stations within a given market and three stations in some of the largest markets  iii allow  for the first time in many years  common ownership of broadcast stations and daily newspapers in most markets  iv generally allow common ownership of television and radio stations within a given market  and v change the definition of market for purposes of the rules restricting the number of radio stations that may be commonly owned within a given market 
the new rules were appealed in federal court  and in september of  the court stayed the effectiveness of the new rules  pending a decision in the appeal 
as a result of the stay  the former ownership rules were reinstated 
we cannot predict the outcome of the appeal 

table of contents recent federal legislation set the national tv ownership cap at  superseding the increase to adopted by the fcc 
this represents an increase from the limit previously in place  and its immediate effect is to allow on a permanent basis the existing levels of station ownership by the fox and cbs networks  which previously had been allowed only as a result of a temporary waiver of the limit 
this may give fox and cbs a competitive advantage over us  since they have much greater financial and other resources than we have 
we cannot predict the impact of these developments on our business 
in particular  we cannot predict the outcome of fcc s media ownership proceeding or its effect on our ability to acquire broadcast stations in the future or to continue to own and freely transfer stations that we have already acquired 
in  we acquired a controlling interest in five fm stations and one am station in the austin  texas market 
under the method of defining radio markets contained in the new ownership rules  it appears that we would be permitted to own or control only four fm stations in the austin market ownership of one am station would continue to be allowed 
the new rules do not require divestiture of existing non conforming station combinations  but do provide that such clusters may be transferred only to defined small business entities 
consequently  if the new rules go into effect and we wish to sell our interest in the austin stations  we will have to either sell to an entity that meets the fcc definition or exclude at least one fm station from the transaction 
as a result of our acquisition of lee enterprises in october  we own two top rated television stations in the honolulu market  which is not permitted by fcc rules 
as a result  we have been operating both stations under various temporary waivers to the fcc s ownership rules 
the fcc has adopted new local television ownership rules which continue to prohibit the ownership of two top rated television stations in a single market  and in so doing the fcc ordered companies with temporary waivers including us to file divesting applications to achieve compliance 
however  the implementation of the new rules has been appealed in federal court by a number of broadcasters including us and other groups  and the court has issued an indefinite stay  which has prevented the new rules from becoming effective 
we cannot predict when or how the court will rule on the appeal 
when and if the stay is lifted  we will likely have to either file a divesting application or seek a permanent waiver of the new rules 
if we are required to divest a station on short notice  we may not realize the full value of that station 
our business strategy and our ability to operate profitably depends on the continued services of our key employees  the loss of whom could materially adversely affect our business 
our ability to maintain our competitive position depends to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team and certain key employees 
although all of our executive officers are currently under employment agreements  their managerial  technical and other services would be difficult to replace if we lose the services of one or more of them or other key personnel 
our business could be seriously harmed if one of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise competes directly or indirectly against us 
our radio and television stations employ or independently contract with several on air personalities and hosts of syndicated radio and television programs with significant loyal audiences in their respective broadcast areas 
these on air personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of a station and  thus  the ability of the station to sell advertising 
these individuals may not remain with our radio and television stations and may not retain their audiences 
our current and future operations are subject to certain risks that are unique to operating in a foreign country 
we currently have several international operations  including a interest in a national radio station in hungary  as well as operations in slovakia and belgium  and  therefore  we are exposed to risks inherent in international business operations 
we may pursue opportunities to buy additional broadcasting properties in other foreign countries 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries include the following changing regulatory or taxation policies  currency exchange risks  changes in diplomatic relations or hostility from local populations  seizure of our property by the government or restrictions on our ability to transfer our property or earnings out of the foreign country  
table of contents potential instability of foreign governments  which might result in losses against which we are not insured  and difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems 
our failure to comply under the sarbanes oxley act of could cause a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 
we have undergone a comprehensive effort to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of compliance was required as of february  this effort included documenting and testing our internal controls 
as of february   we did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal controls as defined by the public company accounting oversight board 
in future years  there are no assurances that we will not have material weaknesses that would be required to be reported or that we will be able to comply with the reporting deadline requirements of section a reported material weakness or the failure to meet the reporting deadline requirements of section could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 
this loss of confidence could cause a decline in the market price of our stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of emmis due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
emmis is exposed to market risk from changes in domestic and international interest rates ie prime and libor and foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage interest rate exposure  emmis periodically enters into interest rate derivative agreements 
emmis does not use financial instruments for trading and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
as of february   emmis was not a party to any interest rate derivative agreements 
interest rates at february   the entire outstanding balance under our credit facility  approximately of emmis total outstanding debt credit facility  senior subordinated debt and senior discount notes  bears interest at variable rates 
the credit facility requires emmis to maintain fixed interest rates  for at least a two year period  on a minimum of of emmis total outstanding debt  as defined including the senior subordinated debt  but excluding the senior discount notes 
this ratio of fixed to floating rate debt must be maintained if emmis total leverage ratio  as defined  is greater than at any quarter end 
emmis currently has no interest rate derivative arrangements  as its total leverage ratio  as defined  was less than as of february  based on amounts outstanding at february   if the interest rate on our variable debt were to increase by  our annual interest expense would be higher by approximately million 
foreign currency emmis owns a interest in a hungarian subsidiary which is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
this subsidiary s operations are measured in its local currency forint 
emmis has a natural hedge against currency fluctuations between the forint and the us dollar since most of the subsidiary s long term obligations are denominated in hungarian forints 
emmis owns nine radio stations in belgium  which are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements  and its investment to date is approximately million 
these subsidiaries operations are measured in their local currency euro 
subsequent to the balance sheet date  emmis purchased a radio network in slovakia for approximately million 
this subsidiary is measured in its local currency koruna 
while emmis management cannot predict the most likely average or end of period forint to dollar  euro to dollar  or koruna to dollar exchange rates for calendar  we believe any devaluation of the forint  euro or koruna would have an immaterial effect on our financial statements taken as a whole  as the hungarian  belgian and slovakian stations accounted for approximately of emmis total revenues and approximately of emmis total assets as of  and for the year ended  february  at february   the hungarian subsidiary had million of us dollar denominated loans outstanding 
the hungarian subsidiary repaid less than million of us dollar denominated loans during fiscal the belgium stations had no us dollar denominated loans outstanding during fiscal or at february  emmis currently does not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to foreign currency translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
