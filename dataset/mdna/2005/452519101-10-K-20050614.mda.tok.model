item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a pharmaceutical company advancing the development and commercialization of oral drugs to treat infectious diseases and extending our proprietary aromatic cation technology platform to the treatment of cancer  diabetes and other diseases 
we have advanced clinical programs that include new treatments for malaria  pneumocystis pneumonia and african sleeping sickness trypanosomiasis  and drug development programs for fungal infections and tuberculosis 
we hold worldwide patents and patent applications  licenses and rights to license technology  primarily from a scientific consortium that has granted us a worldwide license and exclusive right to commercialize products from  and license rights to  the technology 
we are working with our scientific and foundation partners to i complete the clinical programs for malaria  pneumocystis pneumonia and african sleeping sickness  ii advance new drug candidates into the clinic and iii validate the broad application of our technology platform and illustrate its low toxicity and oral deliverability see item products and programs above 
we believe we can build a sustainable and profitable business by selling drugs in niche markets in certain developing countries as we target treatments for multi billion dollar markets such as fungal infections  tuberculosis  cancer and diabetes 
the united states food and drug administration fda has granted fast track designation to our first oral drug candidate  db  to treat african sleeping sickness 
fast track designation may allow for accelerated fda review of db to treat african sleeping sickness  however  there is no guarantee that fast track designation will result in faster product development or impact the likelihood or timing of product approval 
since our formation in october  we have engaged in pharmaceutical research and drug development  expanding our scientific capabilities and collaborative network  developing technology licensing agreements and  since obtaining the rights thereto in  advancing the commercialization of the aromatic cation technology platform 
to minimize stockholders dilution  we use foundation and government grants  the expertise and resources of strategic partners and third parties in a number of areas  including i discovery research  ii pre clinical and human clinical trials and iii manufacture of pharmaceutical drugs 
we have licensing and exclusive commercialization rights to an aromatic cationic anti infective pharmaceutical technology platform and are developing drugs intended for commercial use based on that technology 
dication drugs a structural class of aromatic cation drugs defined by molecules with positive charges on each end held together by a linker bind in the minor groove of an organism s dna  and  in so doing  interfere with the activity of enzymes needed for microbial growth  thereby killing the infectious organisms that cause fungal  parasitic  bacterial and viral diseases 
structurally  dications are chemical molecules that have two positively charged ends held together by a chemical linker shaped like a molecular barbell 
the composition of the dications  with positive charges on the ends and linkers of different length  shape  flexibility and curvature  allows binding to specific sites of the dna or other receptors  interfering with key biochemical processes fundamental to microbe growth and development 
with the exception of certain research funding agreements and certain grants  we have not generated any revenue from operations 
for the period from inception october  to march   we incurred cumulative net losses of approximately  we have incurred additional losses since such date and we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we expect that our cash sources for at least the next year will be limited to o payments from the university of north carolina at chapel hill  charitable foundations and other research collaborators under arrangements that may be entered into in the future  o research grants  such as small business technology transfer program sttr grants and small business innovation research sbir grants  and o borrowing funds or the issuance of securities 
the timing and amounts of grant and payment revenues  if any  will likely fluctuate sharply and depend upon the achievement of specified milestones  and results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the fair value of our preferred and common stock and related options and warrants  the recognition of revenues and costs related to our research contracts  and the useful lives or impairment of our property and equipment 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
grants to perform research are our primary source of revenue and are generally granted to support research and development activities for specific projects or drug candidates 
revenue related to grants to perform research and development is recognized as earned based on the performance requirements of the specific grant 
upfront cash payments from research and development grants are reported as deferred revenue until such time as the research and development activities covered by the grant are performed 
we use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based awards granted to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and its related interpretations 
we record stock based compensation expense for non employees at the fair value of the options or warrants granted in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas and emerging issues task force no 
eitf 
the fair value of options granted to non employees is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the model considers a number of factors  including the market price and volatility of our common stock at the date of measurement 
we measure the compensation expense for options and warrants granted to non employees as the underlying options vest 
the compensation expense related to all grants is being amortized using the graded vesting method  in accordance with sfas  eitf and fasb interpretation no 
 over the vesting period of each respective stock option 
we believe that the accounting policies affecting these estimates are our critical accounting policies 
research and development expenses all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  payroll and personnel expenses  lab supplies  preclinical studies  raw materials to manufacture clinical trial drugs  manufacturing costs  sponsored research at other labs  consulting and research related overhead

even if development is completed on schedule  there is no guarantee that any of our products will be licensed for sale 
human trials conducted in foreign and developing countries have additional risks  including governmental and local militia uprisings that may interrupt or displace our work
