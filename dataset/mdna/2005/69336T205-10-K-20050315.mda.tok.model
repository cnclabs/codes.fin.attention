operating revenues in the air medical segment increased million  or  due to the additional air medical operations established during the year  further discussed below 
in addition  the international segment had an increase of million in operating revenues due to an increase in rates and flight hours 
these amounts were offset in part by a decrease in technical services operating revenues of million due to completion of that segment s principal contract during the year 
domestic oil and gas operating revenues also decreased million due to a decrease in flight hours to  for compared to  in  which resulted from a decrease in activities in the gulf of mexico by our customers 
total flight hours were  for compared to  for  a decrease of 
all of the decrease occurred in the domestic oil and gas segment  but was largely offset by increases of  hours in the air medical segment and  hours in the international segment 
the number of aircraft at december   was compared to at december  aircraft in the domestic oil and gas segment decreased by  and aircraft in the air medical segment increased by nine 
direct operating expense was million in compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
air medical direct expense increased million due to the increased operations 
this amount was offset in part by a decrease in the domestic oil and gas segment of million due to additional insurance premium cost in the prior year million  termination of certain manufacturer warranty agreements million and a reduction in recurring warranty expense million 
there was also a decrease in flight hours and fewer aircraft in that segment 
in addition  there was a decrease of million in the international segment due to a decrease in aircraft component repairs  and a decrease of million in technical services segment due to reduced labor and parts costs resulting from completion of its principal contract 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million  all of which was due to the expansion in the air medical segment 
as discussed in the september   form q  the expansion of the air medical segment continued into late  and we also plan to continue the expansion in operating revenues from the new locations were million for this is further discussed in the segment detail  air medical operations 
late in  we took delivery of two transport category aircraft which will be placed in service in the domestic oil and gas segment in the first quarter we will take delivery of two additional transport category aircraft with a total cost of million in the second quarter of  also to be placed in service in the domestic oil and gas segment 
based on customer commitments in that segment  we have placed orders for another nine medium and light aircraft with a total cost of million 
additionally  we expect to continue the expansion of the air medical segment in and have placed orders for eight aircraft for that segment at a cost of million 
these plans are further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources of management s discussion and analysis

net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was due to the increase in accounts receivable related to the increased operations in the air medical segment 
capital expenditures were million for compared to million for gross proceeds from aircraft sales were million for compared to million for on april   we issued million in principal amount of series a senior unsecured notes due in a private offering that was exempt from registration under rule a under the securities act of the securities act 
all of the notes were subsequently exchanged for our series b senior notes due the series b senior notes  pursuant to an exchange offer that was registered under the securities act 
the series b senior notes bear annual interest at payable semi annually on may and november of each year and mature in may the series b senior notes contain restrictive covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  liens  dividends  repurchases of capital stock and other payments affecting restricted subsidiaries  issuance and sales of restricted subsidiary stock  dispositions of proceeds of asset sales  and mergers and consolidations or sales of assets 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
on june   we amended our million revolving credit facility with a commercial bank  which was scheduled to expire july  the amendment reduced the revolving credit facility from million to million  and extends the expiration date to july  the credit agreement includes covenants related to working capital  funded debt to net worth  and consolidated net worth 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we believe that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund operating requirements and required interest payments on the notes for the next twelve months 
we expect to finance the acquisition of new aircraft  discussed below  with operating leases  the issuance of debt or equity securities or some combination thereof 

table of contents the table below sets out our contractual obligations related to operating lease obligations  notes payable and the senior notes issued in the operating leases are not recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet  but payments are treated as an expense as incurred 
each contractual obligation included in the table contains various terms  conditions  and covenants which  if violated  accelerate the payment of that obligation 
we currently lease four aircraft included in the lease obligations below 
payment due by year beyond total thousands of dollars purchase commitments aircraft lease obligations facility lease obligations notes payable long term debt these commitments are for aircraft for which we intend to execute an operating lease or obtain other external financing 
these commitments are discussed below 
estimated interest costs on the debt obligations set forth above  without considering any additional debt that may be obtained relative to purchase commitments for aircraft  are as follows in thousands     and  in  we took delivery of two transport category aircraft and entered into a year operating lease with annual payments of approximately million annually for each aircraft 
we also exercised our option to acquire two additional transport category aircraft due to customer commitments 
these aircraft are scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of the cost of these additional two aircraft is million 
in addition  we have an option to acquire two additional transport category aircraft from the same manufacturer  which would be exercised based on customer requirements 
based on customer commitments in the domestic oil and gas segment  we placed orders for nine additional aircraft 
the cost of these aircraft is million with deliveries scheduled in and the first quarter additionally  we will continue the expansion of the air medical operations in  and have placed orders for an additional eight aircraft 
the cost of these aircraft is million and deliveries are scheduled throughout critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  long lived assets and self insurance liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is estimated based on an evaluation of individual customer financial strength  current market conditions  and other information 
if our evaluation of our significant customers and debtors 
table of contents creditworthiness should change or prove incorrect  then we may have to recognize additional allowances in the period that it identifies the risk of loss 
we maintain inventory to service our own aircraft and the aircraft and components of customers 
portions of that inventory are used parts that are often exchanged with parts removed from aircraft or components and reworked to a useable condition 
we use systematic procedures to estimate the valuation of the used parts  which includes consideration of their condition and continuing utility 
if our valuation of these parts should be significantly different from amounts ultimately realizable or if we discontinue using or servicing certain aircraft models  then we may have to record a write down of our inventory 
we also record provisions against inventory for obsolescent and slow moving parts  relying principally on specific identification of such inventory 
if we fail to identify such parts  additional provisions may be necessary 
our principal long lived assets are aircraft 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows that it expects the asset to generate 
when an asset is determined to be impaired  we recognize the impairment amount  which is measured by the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds fair value 
similarly  we report assets that we expect to sell at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we must make estimates for certain of our liabilities and expenses  losses  and gains related to self insured programs  insurance deductibles  and good experience premium returns 
our group medical insurance program is largely self insured  and we use estimates to record its periodic expenses related to that program 
we also carry deductibles on our workers compensation program and aircraft hull and liability insurance and poor experience or higher accidents rates could result in additional recorded losses 
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements applicable to the company  see note to the financial statements 
environmental matters we have an aggregate estimated liability of million as of december  for environmental remediation costs that are probable and estimable 
we have conducted environmental surveys of the former lafayette facility  which we vacated in  and have determined that limited soil and ground water contamination exists at the facility 
groundwater monitoring wells have been installed 
periodic monitoring and reporting are being conducted 
in may  phi submitted a louisiana risk evaluation corrective action plan recap standard site assessment report to the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq fully defining the extent and type of contamination 
once ldeq completes its review of the site assessment and reports on whether all contamination has been fully defined  a risk evaluation in accordance with recap will be submitted and evaluated by ldeq 
at that point  ldeq will establish what cleanup standards must be met at the site 
when the process is complete  we will be in a position to develop the appropriate remediation plan and the resulting cost of remediation 
however  we have not recorded any estimated liability for remediation of contamination and  based on the may  site assessment report and ongoing monitoring  we believe the ultimate remediation costs for the lafayette facility will not be material to our consolidated financial position  results of operation or liquidity 
during  ldeq advised us that groundwater contaminants impacting monitor wells at our lafayette heliport were originating from an off site location and that phi would not be required to perform further monitoring at the site 
also during  the texas commission on environmental quality tceq agreed that remediation of the rockport  texas facility was at a point at which site closure has been granted and no further action would be required 
final documents granting closure will be issued by tceq during the first quarter of these two developments resulted in a reduction of the environmental reserves of million during 
table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates and prior to april   made limited use of derivative financial instruments to manage that risk 
when used  all derivatives for risk management are closely monitored by our senior management 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes and we do not use derivatives with leveraged or complex features 
derivative instruments are transacted either with creditworthy major financial institutions or over national exchanges 
on april   we paid our terminated loan agreement 
the terminated loan agreement had variable interest rates 
in conjunction with the payment of the terminated loan agreement  we settled our interest rate swap agreements by paying million to the counterparties 
also on april   we issued notes of million that have an interest rate of payable semi annually on may and november of each year  beginning november   and mature in may the market value of the notes will vary as changes occur to general market interest rates  the remaining maturity of the notes  and our credit worthiness 
at december   the market value of the notes was million 
a hypothetical basis point increase to the notes imputed interest rate at december  would have resulted in a market value decline to approximately million
