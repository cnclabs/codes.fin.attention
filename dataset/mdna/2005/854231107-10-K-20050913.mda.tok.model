item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview standex international corporation the company or we is a leading producer of a variety of products and services for diverse market segments 
the company has five reporting segments food service equipment group  air distribution products group  engraving group  engineered products group  and consumer products group 
because these segments serve different markets  the performance of each is affected by different external and economic factors 
the company believes that its diversification has helped to reduce the earnings cyclicality that affects many companies that focus principally on only one or two market segments 
therefore  it intends to continue to operate in selected market segments that may not directly relate to one another 
however  through its focused diversity strategy  the company is aggressively seeking to build those businesses which offer the best opportunities for future growth and profitability  through both organic growth and acquisitions 
a key part in the implementation of the company s strategy was the restructuring initiative which was announced in and completed in among the measures taken as part of that initiative were the divestitures of product lines that offered little growth opportunity 
the company expects to take further actions in support of its strategy in future quarters by seeking bolt on acqui sitions that both increase its presence in existing markets and broaden the reach of its products and technology into complementary markets 
to achieve this  the company has put in place an acquisition program designed to identify acquisition candidates in areas that have been determined to be most strategically significant to its business portfolio  such as food service  scientific chambers and cabinets  electronics  hydraulics and engraving 
in addition to using traditional in house merger and acquisition resources  we are working with several investment bankers to conduct searches on our behalf for larger companies with sales in excess of million 
in addition to its strategic objectives  the company is aggressively seeking to reduce its operating costs through continued implementation of lean enterprise throughout its production facilities  the rationalization of its manufacturing capacity  and the launching of efforts to source products and materials from and manufacture products in lower cost countries such as mexico and china 
the company  and especially its food service equipment and engineered products groups  is aggressively implementing the sourcing of materials from china and has identified significant savings of to percent from chinese procurement sources 
during fiscal year  the company completed the creation and organization of a wholly owned subsidiary in tianjin  china to help facilitate its sourcing initiative 
through the team at this subsidiary  the company has identified approximately million in potential procurements  and has co mmenced the actual placement of purchase orders 
the company is also evaluating the establishment of manufacturing operations in china for certain of its product lines to take advantage of the lower operating costs and the expanding market in china for certain products 
through the construction of a new facility  the company is expanding its manufacturing operations in mexico  both to take advantage of the lower operating costs there  which it expects will permit an improvement in profit margins on high volume  labor intensive products  and to better reach potential new customers and markets in california and the southwestern united states 
the company expects to spend approximately million relating to the facility in fiscal  including initial capital improvements 
the construction is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year the company also expects that the costs to bring the facility to full capacity will be dilutive to earnings by approximately  to million in fiscal the facility is expected to be of particular benefit to the food service equipment  engineered products and air distribution products groups 
t he company anticipates that once the facility is fully operational  which it expects will occur by the end of fiscal  annual savings in the range of million to million will be realized 
the company has also placed a priority on identifying and implementing operational and strategic synergies amongst its businesses 
during fiscal  the company took steps to lower the air distribution products group s adp cost structure by closing one of the group s eight factories 
this closure  which occurred in the fourth quarter  resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million 
given the diversity in the portfolio of the company and the need to reduce operating costs  the company will periodically incur costs associated with this type of cost reduction activity as restructuring 
there are a number of key external factors other than general business and economic conditions that can impact the performance of the businesses of the company 
the key factors affecting each business are described below 
there are several items that affect the comparability of performance information of the company between the periods discussed in this report 
these items include the following in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized a pre tax restructuring charge of  for severance in connection with the closure of a manufacturing plant representing excess capacity in our adp group 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million associated with the closure of the manufacturing plant in our adp group and the decision to sell the real property at that location 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized a pre tax charge of million associated with the disposal of the global operations of james burn international jbi 
in the first quarter of fiscal  an additional pre tax charge of  was taken in connection with the final disposition of jbi 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we announced the consolidation of the rochester  ny engraving business into the richmond  virginia facility and recorded pre tax restructuring charges in the first quarter of fiscal of  in our engraving group 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of nor lake  incorporated to complement and expand the product offerings within our food service equipment group 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we acquired substantially all the assets of magnetico  inc magnetico  a manufacturer of magnetic components  to expand the product offerings of our engineered products group 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of the jarvis caster group business  part of the engineered products group 
in fiscal  we closed the commercial printing business of our consumer products group 
in fiscal  we exited the roll technology engraving business located in germany  part of the engraving group 
the company monitors a number of key performance indicators including net sales  income from operations  capital expenditure  backlog and gross profit margin 
a discussion of these key performance indicators is included within the discussion below 
unless otherwise noted  references to years are to fiscal years 
consolidated results from continuing operations in thousands net sales gross profit margin other operating income restructuring expense income from operations backlog net sales net sales  as reported components of change in sales effect of acquisitions effect of exchange rates organic sales growth net sales from continuing operations increased million in fiscal year  a increase over fiscal year acquisitions added million in sales in while exchange rates favorably impacted sales by million 
after taking these into account  organic sales increased million 
organic sales are defined as sales from businesses which were included in the company s results for both the current reporting period and the same period of the previous year  and include the effect of price changes 
the increase in organic sales was led by several of our core businesses  including businesses within the food service equipment  engineered products  engraving and air distribution products groups 
price increases accounted for approximately of the organic sales growth while the remainder was due to volume improvements 
a further discussion by segment follows 
net sales from continuing operations increased million in fiscal year over  a increase 
acquisitions added million in sales in while exchange rates favorably impacted sales by million 
after taking these into account  organic sales increased million 
with the exception of the consumer products segment  all of our segments reported strong sales growth  with the food service equipment segment reporting the strongest gain 
gross profit margin the company s consolidated gross profit margin decreased to for fiscal year from in the decline was attributable solely to the adp group  and was due to several factors 
first  price increases obtained by adp have not been sufficient to offset the significantly higher price of steel  a key component of the group s products  over the past year 
steel prices have stabilized recently  although at levels higher than in and margins in the engraving group improved year over year  due to increased volume and to efficiencies resulting from the consolidation of the group s rochester  new york facility into the richmond  virginia facility 
margins in the company s other segments were substantially the same as last year 
in the food service equipment group  increased sales of lower margin products were offset by price increases and a strong per formance by the nor lake business unit 
consolidated gross margin for was compared to in  a slight decrease year over year 
the impact of higher steel and other raw material costs in were essentially offset by price increases implemented during the year 
these price increases had a dilutive effect on gross profit margin 
the change is also attributable to the mix of product sales  with higher sales in the adp and food service equipment groups weighting the overall margin down when compared to the prior year levels 
other operating income expense and restructuring the company includes restructuring charges and certain other operating expenses and income as separate line items 
other operating income expense typically includes gains or losses on the sale of real property 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company recorded gains on the sale of assets held for sale of approximately million compared to gains on the sale of property of  in the prior year 
the gains in the current year were primarily attributable to the sale of the land and building in rochester ny  the operations of which were consolidated into our richmond  va location during the current fiscal year 
the company previously noted the completion of the activities associated with the restructuring and realignment plan announced in october although the company does not presently anticipate any additional comprehensive restructuring plan  the diversity of its business portfolio and the ongoing imperative of reducing operating costs makes it likely that the company will incur costs from time to time that  in accordance with current accounting standards  will be classified as restructuring type activities 
these reductions in costs will likely come from various sources  including reducing headcounts  implementing lean manufacturing disciplines and shutting down excess capacity 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company incurred restructuring and impairment costs of approximately million  pre tax  compared to million in the prior year 
of this amount  approximately million was asso ciated with the closure of a plant in the adp group  while the remainder was largely associated with the consolidation of the rochester  new york facility of the engraving group 
during fiscal  the company incurred restructuring costs of approximately million under the restructuring and realignment plan announced in october this amount compared to million in fiscal additional information regarding the restructuring plan is contained within the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the company sold certain properties  resulting in net pre tax gain of  which compared to a pre tax expense of million in fiscal this expense was largely due to costs associated with the early retirements of two former key executives 
the charges related to these retirements included costs that previously were being amortized to an anticipated retirement age  the net present value of the conversion feature of life insurance policies  and a retirement bonus 
the majority of these benefits are being paid over a ten year period commencing after their retirement 
income from operations for the year ended june   income from operations increased million  a increase over fiscal four out of the five segments posted double digit increases 
adp was the exception  reporting a year over year decline in operating income 
a further discussion is included in the segment discussions that follow 
income from operations increased million in fiscal year  a increase over the previous year 
restructuring costs decreased million year over year 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail on restructuring expenses 
in  the company incurred a cost of million associated with the early retirements of two former key executives 
after factoring in these decreases in expenses  the remaining increase in operating income of million is attributable primarily to improved performances within the food service equipment  consumer products and engraving groups  offset by increased corporate expenses 
see further discussions below by segment 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate for the year ended june  was  an increase of from in the prior year 
the prior year s rate included a settlement  net of related fees  of  associated with a multi year research and development credit 
excluding this additional credit  the rate from continuing operations would have been approximately 
the rate includes additional benefits realized upon the completion of the company s tax returns for fiscal reflecting additional tax credits as well as a decrease in the effective foreign income tax rate when compared to the same period in the prior year 
the effective income tax rate from continuing operations for was  essentially unchanged from the prior year s rate of 
included in the rate was a settlement  net of related fees  of  associated with a multi year research and development credit 
excluding this additional credit  the rate from continuing operations would have been approximately capital expenditure in general  the company s capital expenditures over the longer term are expected to be equivalent to its annual depreciation costs 
capital expenditures for were million  well below annual depreciation of million 
the company continued to invest cautiously in capital during the year 
capital expenditure increased million in  a increase over the company is investing in new processing technologies primarily in its food service equipment  engraving and engineered products segments designed to improve productivity and throughput 
the company anticipates capital spending between million and million in  including million associated with the new manufacturing facility in mexico 
capital expenditures for were million  compared to annual depreciation of million 
capital expenditure increased million in  a increase over the company invested in technologies primarily in our food service  air distribution products  engraving and engineered products segments 
backlog for the year ended june   backlog decreased million  a decrease from the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to the fact that orders in the food service equipment group were impacted by the timing of shipments in the useco line of products and the movement by two large procon customers to supplier managed inventory systems  which minimized order placement to shipment timeframes 
last year s backlog contained a number of shipments that were delayed until the fourth quarter by useco customers for the useco line of products 
when these non recurring factors are excluded  backlog across the remaining units is up substantially over last year 
this stronger backlog at the remaining units is due to increased activity in their respective markets 
segment analysis net sales the following table presents net sales by business segment in thousands food service equipment consumer products air distribution products engraving group engineered products food service equipment net sales increased by million in when compared to  a increase 
the acquisition of nor lake in december accounted for million of this increase 
favorable exchange rates  primarily among the us dollar  the euro and the british pound  resulted in an increase to sales of million 
excluding these impacts  net sales increased million  or 
this increase was fueled by strong performances of the commercial refrigeration  hot food equipment and fluid dispensing and circulating systems businesses 
the improved performance in the commercial refrigeration business was due primarily to high demand and  to a lesser extent  to price increases implemented since last year 
the hot food preparation equipment improvement is due to increased supermarket store sales of rotisserie and combi ovens in europe  where the merger of two supermarket chains provided a significan t retrofitting opportunity 
sales of beverage pumps by the procon products unit remained strong and diversification into commercial applications  including welding  pesticide and other industrial applications  added to the unit s growth 
sales of pumps to these sectors increased and  respectively  over the prior year 
the group will continue to pursue opportunities to expand geographically and to diversify its product offerings 
the group also intends to increase its presence with larger buying groups  which represent large food service equipment customers 
sales of the group s other products were largely unchanged from those noted in the prior year 
net sales increased by million in when compared to  a increase 
the acquisition of nor lake in december accounted for million of this increase 
favorable exchange rates resulted in an increase to sales of million 
excluding these impacts  net sales increased million  or 
this increase was fueled by the strong performances of our commercial refrigeration  useco and display case products lines 
the commercial refrigeration business benefited from increased equipment orders in the food service industry  especially among its largest customers  and the display products business benefited from a tripling of export sales to south america 
the useco business completed several product redesigns in fiscal and was awarded a number of new contracts with hospital and other institutional customers in fiscal consumer products net sales increased  in  essentially flat with sales in the prior year 
an increase in sales for the publishing business  the sales of which were positively impacted by new product launches in its curriculum line of products was offset by declines in sales at our religious book store chain where same store sales decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal from the same quarter of fiscal  a result consistent with the broader christian book store market 
the same period in was positively impacted by the release of a major christian themed movie 
during fiscal  the company closed one store and completed the acquisition of an independent store in the third quarter 
sales of our direct marketing business were largely unchanged from those of the prior year 
net sales decreased million in  a change of from this decrease was consistent with the company s efforts to focus the businesses of the group on improving profitability 
sales within the religious book store and direct marketing business improved during the second half of fiscal  in part due to several notable christian themed books and movies 
air distribution products net sales increased by million in  a increase over price increases totaling approximately that were implemented in the last two quarters of fiscal were responsible for all of the increase 
these increases were implemented to offset the dramatically higher costs paid by the segment for galvanized steel  a significant component of the segment s operating costs 
net of those price increases  real unit volume was down when compared to the prior year 
the decline was due largely to the fact that sales in were positively impacted by customer buying in advance of announced price increases 
the company believes that the distortion caused by the advance buying that occurred in the prior year has ended  and anticipates that sales will return to normal levels 
the group s business correlates to housing starts in the regions in which the group operates  which on a proport ionate basis have been flat recently 
the group has diversified its sales channels 
in addition  the segment is positioned to benefit from an increased number of national accounts  due to its manufacturing presence throughout the united states 
net sales increased by million in  a increase over sales increased as a result of a continued strong housing market  product price increases and penetration into the do it yourself market 
price increases were implemented in fiscal to help offset the rapidly rising steel prices experienced throughout the fiscal year 
the company often gives an advanced notice to customers of the price increases 
as noted above  some of the sales gains made in represented advance buying by those customers 
engraving group net sales increased by million in  or over favorable exchange rates accounted for million of the sales increase in excluding this effect  sales increased million  or in the current year 
the increase was attributable to strong demand within all three of the group s business areas mold texturization  roll and plate engraving  and embossing equipment 
the mold texturization business was positively impacted by strong automotive program work worldwide 
the embossing business benefited from the introduction of machinery and rolls that improve the cosmetic appeal and utility of consumer products 
roll and plate engraving received increased orders from several larger industrial companies for laminating rollers and leather embossing plates 
the majority of the sales increases noted above occurred in the us  mexico  brazil and china  while european operations reported an increase in sales of year over year 
net sales increased by million in  or over of this amount  million was the result of the group s acquisition in june of i r international and dornbusch cia  its brazilian affiliate 
favorable exchange rates accounted for the remainder of the increase 
engineered products net sales increased by million in  or over million of the increase was attributable to organic sales growth 
the remainder was due equally to the impact of the acquisition of magnetico and an affiliate in and favorable currency translation adjustments 
the organic sales increase was led by the custom hoists unit  the sales of which increased million 
this increase in sales reflected the stronger core market for telescoping hydraulic cylinders for the dump trailer and dump body industry 
lean manufacturing initiatives in the custom hoists unit have helped to improve the unit s cycle times  deliveries and throughputs  allowing the unit to better serve its customers 
electronics sales increased million in the current year  helped by increased sales of fluid level and other pressure indicators for the automotive industry 
spincraft sales increased million  due largely to sales of new and aftermarket turbine engine components for the energy sector 
sales within the aerospace sector finished slightly ahead of levels 
the future growth of the aerospace sector will be dependent upon the revitalization of commercial rocket launches for heavy payloads and the success of new start up ventures focused on light to medium payload rocket launches 
sales in aviation are consistent with those noted in the prior year as the sector continues to be driven by the expansion of smaller regional jets 
net sales increased by million in  or over in  the company completed the acquisition of magnetico and its affiliate 
the effect of this acquisition was an increase in sales of million 
favorable exchange rates increased sales by million in after taking these into consideration  organic sales increased million in  or 
this was led by the custom hoists unit  year over year sales of which increased million 
this increase in sales reflected the recovery in custom s core market for telescoping lifts 
this market had been in a recession for several years prior to the recovery that began in organic sales of the electronics unit increased by million in products including fluid level and other pressure indicators for the automotive industry helped to fuel this increase in net sales 
income from operations the following table presents income from operations by business segment in thousands food service equipment consumer air distribution products engraving group engineered products restructuring other expenses  net corporate food service equipment income from operations our measure of segment performance increased by million in  a increase over the increase is attributable to several factors 
first  nor lake reported sales gains  a favorable sales mix resulting from increased sales of higher margin scientific refrigerated products  and significant expense reductions as a result of the implementation of cost control measures 
second  income from operations of hot food preparation equipment sales  increased more than from the prior year 
these increases were offset by a reduction in income from operations within our commercial refrigeration and display businesses  the combined operating income of which declined approximately 
price increases were implemented during the year  but they were not sufficient to fully offset material cost increases 
steel  refrigeration components and foam insulation are significant ele ments of the cost structure of refrigerated cabinets and freezers  and these prices increased significantly during the year 
although commodity prices have appeared to stabilize recently  the previous increases year over year resulted in reduced operating income 
income from operations increased by million in  a increase 
the company consolidated the manufacturing facility of useco into the master bilt facility in this consolidation significantly reduced useco s overhead and labor costs 
the increase was also attributable to the increased sales noted above  and improved margins in our procon and federal units  due to their successful implementation of lean manufacturing and better sourcing of materials from alternative sources 
consumer products income from operations increased by  in  an increase over much of this increase is attributable to the publishing business  where cost containment measures and improved sales performance resulted in an increase in operating income of over 
this increase was offset by reduced operating incomes in both the christian book store and direct marketing businesses 
the book seller business incurred costs of approximately  associated with the closure of one store during the current year  as well as the reduced sales on a same store basis noted above 
the decrease in operating income in the direct marketing business is attributable to the increased cost of grapefruit as the hurricanes which occurred last year in florida damaged the crop  resulting in reduced supplies and higher costs 
results for the prior year included one time costs of  associated with the closure of th e commercial printing business 
excluding these costs  income from operations increased by  a increase  with sales flat year over year 
the cost reduction measures taken in the prior years have allowed the businesses to continue to show improvement in income from operations despite minimal sales growth 
the group will continue to focus on cost containment  while focusing on new product development for the publishing unit  more focused marketing in the direct marketing business  and consumer satisfaction activities by the book seller 
income from operations increased by million in  a increase over much of this increase is attributable to management s focus on improving profitability 
the operating income of the direct marketing business increased million year over year as a result of lower marketing expenses and improved operating efficiencies 
in addition  the closure of the commercial printing operation improved the publishing unit s profitability 
air distribution products the adp group was the only segment which reported a decrease in year over year operating income 
income from operations decreased million  or when compared to the prior year 
as noted above  this segment implemented price increases of approximately in fiscal to offset increases in the price of steel 
these price increases significantly mitigated  but did not fully offset the total cost increase 
further  adp experienced volume decreases  which affected operating income 
the group has taken steps to control its costs  including the acceleration of lean manufacturing disciplines and the closure of one of its eight manufacturing facilities in the fourth quarter of the group also expects to benefit from establishing a manufacturing presence at the new facility in mexico discussed in the overview 
manufacturing at that location will be done at lower costs  and the proximity of the facility to locations in the southwestern united states  where housing starts are expected to increase at rates greater than for rates the us overall  will allow the group to better penetrate these important markets 
operating income grew by  in  a increase over this improvement was driven by an increase in sales volume of  partially offset by higher costs for hot rolled galvanized steel 
this steel is a primary component for adp 
the rapid price increases seen throughout the steel industry during were largely offset by sales price increases 
engraving group income from operations rose by million in  a increase over  reflecting strong sales performance throughout the segment  and the cost savings and synergies realized by the consolidation of the segment s rochester  new york and richmond  virginia facilities 
operating income rose by million in  a increase over this increase was in line with the growth in sales for this segment over the same period 
the benefits of the closure of the rochester  ny facility and its consolidation into our virginia operations were offset by closure costs in this segment is continually developing new digital based technologies to reduce the cost of engraving and texturizing and to substantially improve throughput and lead times 
engineered products income from the operations of the engineered products group increased million in year over year  or 
income from operations of the custom hoists business increased from the prior year  due to the higher absorption rate that results from higher sales volume and cost reduction activities 
income from operations of the spincraft units in was approximately the same as in a reduction in operating income due to the fact that a higher percentage of the unit s sales in were of lower margin turbine engine components was offset by improved productivity and a favorable adjustment resulting from the renegotiation of a long term supply contract with a major aerospace customer 
these positives were offset by a decrease in income from operations within the electronics business 
this decrease was due primarily to increases in material costs 
operating income in decreased million  or when compared to the prior year 
the custom hoists unit more than doubled its operating income year over year  an increase of million  due to growth in net sales 
this improvement was more than offset by declines at the spincraft and electronics units 
the spincraft units were negatively impacted by the cost of raw materials  which the units were unable to pass on to customers 
corporate operating expenses for the current year increased  or over the increase is primarily attributable to professional and audit fees associated with compliance work  and increased insurance costs 
to meet the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  the company has incurred costs for additional manpower to supplement current staff levels within the internal audit function  as well as increased costs associated with the external audit of the company s financial statements 
external audit fees exceeded million in fiscal year  an increase of from last year 
the company is primarily self insured for health insurance and workers compensation coverage in the united states 
with the impact of medical inflation  as well as current trends experienced by the company  additional expenses were incurred in the current year to bring reserves to proper levels 
these i ncreased costs were largely offset by other cost reductions in corporate operations 
operating expenses in increased million  a increase over the increase was attributable to increased professional fees associated with the company s sarbanes oxley act compliance  project costs associated with the multi year research and development credit discussed above and higher audit fees  totaling million 
in addition to those costs  increased pension expense costs of million and increased compensation costs of million also contributed to higher expenses in acquisitions the company s growth is dependent not only on organic growth within its existing businesses  but also on the successful completion of acquisitions that align with the strategic goals of the company 
the ability to complete these transactions is dependent upon a number of factors  including the acquisition multiples that the market is demanding  the synergies that can be realized  and the ability to obtain appropriate financing 
acquisitions on december  the company acquired all of the outstanding common shares of nor lake in an all cash deal 
the results of nor lake s operations have been included in the consolidated statement of operations since that date 
nor lake is one of the nation s largest suppliers of walk in coolers and freezers to the food service and scientific industries  with annual net sales of million 
nor lake is an excellent strategic fit with our food service equipment segment for a number of reasons 
it is a provider to the quick serve restaurant business  a segment of the market where we did not have a large presence 
in addition  combining nor lake with our other food service equipment businesses will provide opportunities to capitalize on their respective strengths in systems  technologies and manufacturing expertise  and will create natural synergies in our distribution and service network 
in december  substantially all of the assets of magnetico and its affiliate  trans american transformer  inc  were purchased in an all cash transaction 
the affiliated companies  with combined estimated annual sales of million  custom design and manufacture high reliability  flight critical magnetic components for us military and the aerospace and avionics industries 
this business unit is part of the electronics unit in the engineered products group 
the total purchase price for the above two acquisitions was million and resulted in the recognition of million in goodwill 
discontinued operations in june  the company s board of directors approved a plan to divest the james burn international jbi global operations 
the company completed the sale of jbi in the first quarter of the company recorded a pre tax impairment charge for the assets to be sold of approximately million in and an additional  in  including costs to sell 
jbi recorded annual sales of million in fiscal jbi specializes in wire binding supplies and equipment and has operations located primarily in the united states  mexico  united kingdom  france and singapore 
the wire binding market is experiencing great overcapacity and jbi s business had continued to decline over the last several years 
the operations of jbi have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
as part of the restructuring and realignment plan announced in october  the company sold its jarvis caster group previously included in the engineered products segment in november the caster market in the united states has been impacted by the influx of product from asia pacific and from excess global capacity 
these market conditions and the company s assessment of the jarvis caster group s sales and earnings growth potential  led the company to divest itself of jarvis 
jarvis recorded sales of million in the fiscal year ended june  the results of operations of the group  together with a gain reported in the first quarter of from the sale of real estate  were reclassified to discontinued operations 
also reclassified was an impairment charge related to jarvis of million recorded in the first quarter of the sale of jarvis did not have a material impact to net income 
during the second quarter of  the company finalized its decision to close its printing operation included in the consumer segment and cease its commercial printing business 
in recent years  the printing industry has been undergoing a massive consolidation along with weak demand  overcapacity and rising costs 
the company believed that it could achieve a financial savings by outsourcing its printing needs 
this business unit had net sales of million in fiscal the company completed the closure of this operation at the end of march the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the closure 
in october  the company announced it was exiting the german business for roll technology engraving products  which had net sales of million in fiscal the operation  which was part of the engraving segment  had not been profitable for several years  largely because the business lacked the scale to compete effectively with its two largest competitors in the european market  both of which are headquartered in germany 
as a result of the decision to close the business  a pretax charge of million was included in discontinued operations in the statements of consolidated income 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from continuing operating activities and our revolving credit facility with eight banks 
in  continuing operations generated million of cash flow  compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due to the company s decision to contribute million to our pension plans in the current year  compared with million in the prior year 
excluding the pension contributions  cash flows from continuing operating activities increased by million 
this increase is attributable to improved profitability as well the receipt of a tax refund in fiscal of approximately million for the tax returns 
these positive cash flow components were offset by approximately million in increased net working capital from continuing operations 
net working capital is defined as accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payab le 
in addition  the sale of certain real estate generated million of incremental cash during the year while discontinued operations generated  in cash through the collection of proceeds of million offset by losses and the settlement of liabilities retained as well as other changes in assets and liabilities of million in cash during the year 
we redeployed those resources by investing million in cash for capital expenditures and by reducing debt by million 
in addition  we returned million to shareholders through cash dividends 
we believe that cash flows from continuing operating activities in fiscal will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures  restructuring activities  operating lease payments  pension contributions  mandatory debt payments and dividends 
we expect to spend between million and million on capital expenditures in fiscal in addition  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities 
any cash needed for future acquisition opportunities would be obtained through a combination of any remaining cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in addition to cash flows from continuing operating activities  we have available borrowing capacity under various agreements of up to million as of june  capital structure the company has a million unsecured revolving credit facility with eight banks  of which million was unused and million was available at june  this agreement expires in february proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes or to provide financing for acquisition activity 
available borrowings under the revolving credit facility are reduced by unsecured short term borrowings 
during  the company began discussions with members of the current facility regarding a renewed facility 
the company expects to complete the negotiations and enter into a new multi year facility in the second quarter of fiscal until such time  the company has classified the borrowings outstanding under this facility as short term in the financial statements for the period ended june  the company is confident in its ability to enter into a new facility based on the d iscussions held with member banks  our assessment of the credit market and the strength in the company s balance sheet and cash flows from continuing operations 
in addition to the revolving credit facility  at june   we have two money market credit facilities with banks 
these agreements provide for a maximum unsecured credit line of million 
there was  in outstanding balances as of june  on one of these agreements 
the following table sets forth the company s capitalization at june year ended june in thousands short term debt long term debt total debt less cash total net debt stockholders equity total capitalization stockholders equity increased year over year primarily as a result of the net income of million offset by the dividends paid of million and changes in the additional pension liability net of tax benefit of million less favorable foreign currency movements of million 
the remaining changes are attributable to the treasury stock activity offset by the additional paid in capital increases associated with stock option exercises in the current year 
short and long term net debt decreased by million to million at june  the company s net debt to capital percentage improved to from in historically low interest rates  prior years of negative performance of the equity markets  and changes in actuarial assumptions including mortality rates caused the company to suffer higher pension liabilities and lower pension assets during the current and most recent fiscal year when compared to our history 
these assumptions are more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the company recorded a million after tax equity charge in the fourth quarter of to reflect the additional minimum liability under these plans 
current year investment performance coupled with contributions increased the after tax equity charge to million in the additional minimum liability is calculated based on the funded status of the plan at the end of the fiscal year 
although the company made significant contributions to the defined benefit plans during the current year  the contributions alone were not sufficient to move the variables involved in the calculation 
the company believes that an increase in long term rates in the future will reduce significantly or even eliminate the current charge in equity 
the after tax equity charge and the change year to year does not impact cash or earnings and could reverse in future periods should either interest rates increase and or market performance and plan returns continue to improve 
pension expenses are expected to decrease by approximately between  to  in as a result of the funded status of the pension plans and changes in actuarial assumptions 
cash contribution requirements in are expected to be approximately million 
the company has an insurance program for certain retired key executives 
the underlying policies have a cash surrender value of million and are reported net of loans of million for which the company has the legal right of offset 
these policies have been purchased to fund supplemental retirement income benefits for certain retired executives 
the aggregate present value of future obligations was  and  at june  and  respectively 
the company is contractually obligated under various operating leases for real property 
the company sponsors a number of both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans 
we have evaluated the current and long term cash requirements of these plans 
as noted above  the operating cash flows from continuing operations is expected to be sufficient to cover required contributions under erisa and other governing rules 
contractual obligations of the company as of june  are as follows in thousands payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years long and short term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total off balance sheet items the company had no other material off balance sheet items at june  and at june  other matters inflation certain of the company s expenses  such as wages and benefits  occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact both our reserves for self insured medical plans as well as our reserves for workers compensation claims 
the company monitors the inflationary rate and makes adjustments to reserves whenever it is deemed necessary 
our ability to manage medical costs inflation is dependent upon our ability to manage claims and purchase insurance coverage to limit the maximum exposure for the company 
foreign currency translation the company s primary functional currencies used by its non us subsidiaries are the euro and the british pound sterling pound 
during the current year  both these currencies have experienced significant increases in value relative to the us dollar  the company s reporting currency 
since june  the euro has appreciated by relative to the us dollar  and the pound has appreciated by relative to the us dollar 
these higher exchange values were used in translating the appropriate non us subsidiaries balance sheets into non us dollars at the end of the current quarter 
environmental matters the company is party to various claims and legal proceedings  generally incidental to its business 
as explained more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we do not expect the ultimate disposition of these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
seasonality typically  the second and fourth quarters have been the best quarters for our consolidated financial results 
due to the gift giving holiday season  the consumer segment has experienced strong sales benefiting the second quarter performance 
the fourth quarter performance has been enhanced by increased activity in the construction industry 
employee relations the company maintains a solid working relationship with all of its unions and good employee relations are a focus of management throughout the company 
the company has labor agreements with a number of union locals in the united states and a number of european employees belong to european trade unions 
there were no work stoppages during fiscal year and a total of collective bargaining contracts will expire in fiscal although we believe we have good employee relations  there can be no assurances that work stoppages can be avoided in future periods 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all its subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
although we believe that materially different amounts would not be reported due to the accounting policies described below  the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have listed a number of accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical  but we also believe that all of our accounting policies are important for disclosure purposes 
n bsp  collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligation together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts 
actual collection experience may improve or decline 
realizability of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by a reserve for excess and potentially obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews inventory values on hand using specific aging categories  and records a provision for obsolete and excess inventory based on historical usage and estimated future usage 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
realization of goodwill goodwill is not amortized  however  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
therefore  annually in the fourth quarter we test for goodwill impairment by estimating the fair value of our reporting units using the present value of future cash flows method 
in addition  goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit 
the nature of the estimates made in projecting future cash flows could adversely affect the calculations made by the company if actual cash flows are less 
in addition  the estimate of fair value includes the use of a discount rate and a rate of future growth 
a basis point change in the discount rate used would not affect the company s analysis 
a basis point change in the rate of future growth  in dependent of other variables  would not affect the company s analysis 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill becomes impaired 
cost of employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pensions and some post retirement benefits 
we record expenses relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap  which are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trends 
the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds and is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by matching our expected benefit payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace  adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions 
we review our actuarial assumptions on at least an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
based on information provided by our actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions are reasonable 
the cost of employee benefit plans includes the selection of assumptions noted above 
a one percentage point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets assumptions  holding our discount rate and other assumptions constant  would increase decrease pension expense by approximately  per year 
a basis point decrease increase in our discount rate  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase decrease pension expense by approximately  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 
the company has other important accounting policies that at any point may be considered to be material to the company 
the company has described all significant accounting policies within the footnotes to the financial statements and  when such policies are determined to be material  they are included above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use  from time to time  financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have internal policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of the treasurer and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes only 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes except for certain investments in connection with the keysop plan or speculation is strictly prohibited 
the company has no majority owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the consolidated financial statements 
further  the company has no interests or relationships with any special purpose entities 
exchange risk the company is exposed to both transactional risk and translation risk associated with exchange rates 
regarding transactional risk  the company mitigates certain of its foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time 
these contracts are used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows  such as dividend and loan payments  and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
due to the absence of forward foreign currency contracts at june   th e company did not have any fair value exposure for financial instruments 
within our foreign operations we are also exposed to transactional risks  specifically with our subsidiaries using the euro and the british pound sterling 
this transactional risk is mitigated  in large part  by natural hedges developed with locally denominated debt service 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the value of the euro to the us dollar at june  would not result in a material increase in short term debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
our primary translation risk was with the euro and the british pound sterling 
we do not hedge our translation risk 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect our stockholders equity 
interest rate the company s interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on its variable rate borrowings 
from time to time  the company will use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements 
as of june   a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would increase the company s annual interest expense by  at june  and  the company has no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
the company also has million of long term debt and million of short term debt at fixed interest rates as of june  there would be no immediate impact on the company s interest expense associated with its long term debt due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
concentration of credit risk the company has a diversified customer base 
as such  the risk associated with concentration of credit risk is inherently minimized 
as of june   no one customer accounted for more than of our consolidated outstanding receivables or of our sales 
in certain segments  some customers represent greater than of the segments revenues 
in the food service equipment group  three customers account for approximately of annual sales 
in our engineered products segment  one aerospace customer accounts for approximately of segment annual revenues and one energy customer accounts for approximately of annual sales 
we have a long term supply agreement with the aerospace customer 
although we believe our relationship with this customer is good and will be ongoing  there can be no assurances that this will continue for the entire term of the supply agreement 
in our food se rvice equipment segment  many of our national accounts regularly review their selection of vendors 
although our companies have historically prevailed and even gained market share under these circumstances  the outcome of future reviews can not be predicted 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  primarily steel 
each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements 
in general  we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle 
recently  we have become aware that some of our competitors have been put on allocation for key materials 
while standex considers its relationship with its suppliers to be excellent and we have not been impacted  there can be no assurances that we will not experience any supply shortage 
in recent quarters  the adp  engineered products and food service equipment groups experienced price increases for steel products  other metal commodities and petroleum based products 
among those items impacted were the prices of galvanized steel strip  stainless steel and carbon steel sheet material  copper wire  refrigeration components and foam insulation 
these are key elements in the products manufactured in these segments 
our affected divisions have implemented price increases intended on fully offsetting the increases in steel 
the implemented price increases in the food service equipment group did not fully offset the higher material costs and the price increases in adp did not fully offset the steel price increases 
wherever possible  the company will implement price increases to offset the impact of material prices 
the ultimate acceptance of these price increases  if implemented  w ill be impacted by our affected divisions respective competitors and the timing of their price increases
