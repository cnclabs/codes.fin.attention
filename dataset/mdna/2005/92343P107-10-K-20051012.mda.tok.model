item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
part i item business general veritas is a leading provider of integrated geophysical information and services to the petroleum industry worldwide 
our customers include major  national and independent oil and gas companies that utilize geophysical technologies to identify new subsurface areas favorable for the production of hydrocarbons  determine the size  structure and stratigraphy of previously identified oil and gas fields  and optimize development and production of hydrocarbon reserves 
we acquire  process  interpret and market geophysical information that provides d and d images of the subsurface 
we also produce d surveys  which record fluid movement in the reservoir  by repeating specific d surveys over time 
additionally  we use geophysical data for reservoir characterization to enable our customers to maximize their recovery of oil and natural gas 
services and markets we conduct geophysical surveys on both a contract and a multi client basis 
when we conduct surveys on a contract basis  we acquire and process data for a single client who pays us to conduct the survey and owns the data we acquire 
when we conduct surveys on a multi client basis  we acquire and process data for our own account and license that data and associated products to multiple clients 
the high cost of acquiring and processing geophysical data on an exclusive basis has prompted many oil and gas companies to license surveys on a multi client basis 
in response to this demand  we have built a large library of surveys consisting of over  line kilometers of d data and over  square kilometers of d data 
our marine data library includes surveys in the gulf of mexico  the north atlantic  southeast asia  west africa  north africa  canada and brazil 
our land data library includes surveys in texas  mississippi  oklahoma  wyoming and utah in the united states as well as alberta and british columbia in canada 
the portion of our revenue generated from the sale of multi client data licenses is influenced by a number of factors  including government licensing of exploration and production rights  and as a result  will fluctuate from year to year 
the following tables describe our revenues by contract type and geographic area based on the location of the product or service provided years ended july  revenues by contract type in thousands contract work licensing of multi client data total years ended july  revenues by geographic area in thousands united states canada latin america europe middle east africa asia pacific total in fiscal  and   and  respectively  of our revenues were attributable to non us operations and export sales 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional geographic and segment information 
principal operating assets we acquire  process  and interpret geophysical information utilizing a wide array of assets as follows land acquisition our land acquisition activities are performed with technologically advanced geophysical equipment 
as of july   our land survey equipment had a combined recording capacity of approximately  channels 
we typically deploy equipment in north and south america and oman by crews of varying size 
our crew count varies widely as land acquisition is a seasonal activity in many markets  primarily due to weather 
our land operations include surveying crews  which lay out the lines to be recorded and mark the sites for shot hole placement or equipment location  and recording crews  which use explosive or mechanical vibrating units to produce acoustic impulses and recording units to synchronize the shooting and capture the seismic signals via geophones 
on a land survey where explosives are used  the recording crew is supported by several drill crews  which are typically furnished by third parties under short term contracts 
drill crews operate in advance of the recording crew and bore shallow holes for explosive charges which  when detonated by the recording crew  produce the necessary acoustic impulse 
marine acquisition our marine acquisition crews operate from both owned and chartered vessels that have been modified or equipped to our specifications 
all of the vessels we utilize are equipped to perform both d and d geophysical surveys 
during the last several years  the majority of the marine geophysical data acquisition services we performed involved d surveys 
the following table contains certain information concerning the geophysical vessels we operate 
vessel year entered service length beam charter expiration pacific sword feet feet october seisquest feet feet may veritas viking feet feet may veritas viking ii feet feet may veritas vantage feet feet april veritas searcher feet feet owned we are replacing the veritas searcher with a new chartered vessel of greater capability  with expected delivery in mid each vessel is equipped with geophysical recording instrumentation  digital geophysical streamer cable  cable location and geophysical data location systems  multiple navigation systems  a source control system that controls the synchronization of the energy source and a firing system that generates the acoustic impulses 
streamer cables contain hydrophones that receive the acoustic impulses reflected by variations in the subsurface strata 
at present  five of our vessels are equipped with multiple streamers and multiple energy sources 
these vessels acquire more lines of data with each pass  which reduces completion time and the acquisition cost 
the veritas viking  veritas viking ii and the veritas vantage are each capable of deploying streamers simultaneously  although each is currently equipped to tow eight 
the veritas viking  veritas viking ii  veritas vantage and veritas searcher are equipped with solid streamers that offer numerous advantages over oil filled streamers 
the solid streamers allow these vessels to work in rougher seas and record more desirable frequencies with less noise and less downtime than is possible with oil filled streamers 
data processing and interpretation we operate data processing centers capable of processing d and d data 
most of our data processing services are performed on d seismic data 
the centers process data received from the field  both from our own crews and from other geophysical companies  to produce an image of the earth s subsurface using proprietary computer software and techniques 
we also reprocess older geophysical data using new techniques designed to enhance the quality of the data 
our data processing centers have opened at various times since and are at present located in north america south america europe africa middle east asia pacific houston  texas buenos aires  argentina crawley  england singapore calgary  canada caracas  venezuela stavanger  norway perth  australia aberdeen  scotland jakarta  indonesia lagos  nigeria kuala lumpur  malaysia luanda  angola pau  france milan  italy our processing centers operate high capacity  advanced technology data processing systems on high speed cluster cpus 
these systems run our proprietary data processing software 
the marine and land data acquisition crews have software compatible with that utilized in the processing centers  allowing for ease in the movement of data from the field to the data processing centers 
our centers can generally process both land and marine data and we tailor the equipment and software deployed in an area to meet the local market demands 
we operate visualization centers in houston  calgary  perth  and crawley 
these four centers allow teams of our customers geoscientists and engineers to view and interpret large volumes of complex d data 
the visualization centers have imaging tools used for advanced interpretive techniques that enhance the understanding of regional as well as detailed reservoir geology 
these visualization centers allow us to offer our expertise combined with the type of collaborative geophysical model building that is enabling oil companies to explore areas of complex geology such as the large sub salt plays in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
we have groups of scientists and engineers located in calgary  houston  and leoben  austria who perform advanced geophysical and geological interpretation on a contract basis 
these experts work around the world  using third party and our proprietary software to create subsurface models for our clients and advise our clients on how best to exploit their reservoirs 
their work is related to exploration as well as production activities 
additionally  we license our proprietary hampson russell software to companies desiring to do their own geophysical interpretation 
technology and capital expenditures the geophysical industry is highly technical  and the requirements for the acquisition and processing of geophysical data have evolved continuously during the past years 
accordingly  it is critical that our technological capabilities are comparable or superior to those of our competitors 
we maintain our technological capabilities through continuing research and development  strategic alliances with equipment manufacturers  and by acquiring technology from others 
our research and development staff includes scientists  engineers or programmers 
our research and development efforts focus on new acquisition technologies and processes and on our core processing and imaging software 
in  we formed a group to develop and apply technologies to record  process and interpret multi component waveforms  an area of growing interest among our customers 
during fiscal  and  research and development expenditures were million  million and million  respectively 
our research and development budget for fiscal is approximately million 
during fiscal  and  capital expenditures for equipment were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for fiscal included approximately million for replacement equipment for equipment lost or damaged on the veritas viking in january a majority of the cost of this equipment will be reimbursed to us by our insurance carrier 
because the insurance reimbursement is greater than the book value of the equipment  we have recorded a gain on the involuntary conversion 
we expect to invest approximately million in capital equipment during fiscal most of our fiscal capital budget is allocated to replacement and upgrading of existing equipment 
during fiscal  and  our cash multi client investment  net of capitalized depreciation  was million  million and million  respectively 
for fiscal  we are planning a cash multi client investment of approximately million 
our total planned cash investment in the company of million is significantly less than our planned cash flow from operations and  therefore  we expect to generate an increase in our cash balance during fiscal competition the acquisition and processing of geophysical data for the oil and gas industry has historically been highly competitive worldwide 
success in marketing geophysical services is based on several factors  including price  crew experience  equipment availability  technological expertise  reputation for quality and dependability and  in the case of multi client surveys  availability of surveys in the area of current customer interest 
our largest global competitors are western geco a joint venture between schlumberger and baker hughes  compagnie g n rale de g ophysique sa and petroleum geo services asa 
additionally  there are a large number of seismic companies  mostly small and local  in the land acquisition and land data processing areas where financial and technical barriers to entry are minimal 
in the multi client library business  we compete with the full service seismic companies mentioned above  as well as with specialty library companies such as tgs nopec geophysical company asa and seitel inc we compete to a lesser degree with large  state affiliated companies such as bgp of china 
these companies are large providers of seismic services in their home countries and have recently been expanding their operations to include other parts of the world 
they are particularly aggressive in price sensitive markets  such as those involving large tenders to national oil companies  where low price is of paramount importance 
due to the constantly changing configurations of seismic crews and the immense numbers of channels in the market  it is impossible to discuss the global competition in land acquisition in any quantitative fashion 
tracking our competition is more feasible in the marine acquisition market 
according to a september  report by enskilda securities  a third party industry analyst  there are a total of towed streamer vessels working in the world  including d vessels and d vessels 
in fiscal  there were temporary and local shortages of vessels of specific capability  which allowed us to increase seismic acquisition margins in certain regions 
backlog at july   our backlog of commitments for future revenue was million  compared with million at july  approximately of this backlog is related to multi client surveys 
we anticipate that most of the july  backlog will be completed over the next twelve months 
this backlog consists of written orders or firm commitments 
contracts for services are subject to modification by mutual consent and in certain instances are cancelable by the customer on short notice without penalty 
as a result of these factors  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for any succeeding period 
significant customers our customers include major oil and gas companies  national oil companies and independent oil and gas companies 
in fiscal  a single  large multi national oil company represented of our revenues primarily due to the increased revenue generated by a large d survey acquired in the gulf of mexico 
in fiscal and  no customer accounted for or more of our total revenue 
employees during fiscal  we employed an average of  people on a full time basis 
our number of employees varies greatly due to activity changes in our land acquisition business  and during fiscal ranged from a low of  to a high of  this variation typically occurs on a seasonal basis  with higher employee counts and higher revenues occurring during our second and third fiscal quarters  coinciding with the winter seismic acquisition seasons in alaska and canada 
however  performance of large land surveys in south america or other locales can cause a marked shift from this pattern 
a total of employees in singapore are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fiscal proved to be another year of improvement in the seismic industry  as it continues to move out of the weak timeframe to what appears to be a robust future 
we first noted a change in our marketplace during the first quarter of fiscal  when we began to see exploration and production companies actively competing with each other for access to seismic acquisition assets in certain markets  driving prices upward 
indeed  the growth of demand in the global marine seismic acquisition market was an industry highlight of fiscal  and the area where we generated most of our growth 
over the last few years  the seismic industry has been able to provide increased fidelity of subsurface depiction in difficult areas to image  such as below the massive salt formations in the gulf of mexico  by using advanced acquisition techniques  processing technologies and more powerful computers 
recently  exploration and production companies have begun to show increased interest in these new techniques to further illuminate the subsurface 
while seismic has traditionally been used primarily as an exploration tool  we are seeing increasing interest in new seismic imaging techniques  such as multi or wide azimuth marine acquisition  which offer better definition of complex structures  advancing the use of seismic for reservoir delineation 
we have been  and continue to be  the leader in the area of improved imaging through our cutting edge processing technologies  including proprietary pre stack depth migration psdm and wave equation migration methods 
additionally  many of the surveys in our data library have been acquired or enhanced using these advanced techniques 
in the data acquisition area  we were an early adopter of multi component acquisition on land and  in fiscal  were the first company to acquire a large scale wide azimuth survey offshore 
the recent increased interest in these enhanced acquisition and processing techniques is further driven by the oil industry s inability to replace reserves at or above their rate of use 
since the beginning of calendar  on average  global oil produced has significantly exceeded the annual volume of reserves discovered 
accordingly  estimates of global excess oil capacity have been dropping while demand has been increasing 
the most obvious result of these trends is the increasing global oil price  which has repeatedly set new records in recent months 
to increase their reserve replacement rate  we believe most of our customers will respond to the challenge by increasing their exploration budgets over the next two to three years 
while much of their total exploration budgets may go toward drilling  they will first need drillable prospects 
the most successful tool for economically finding these prospects is d seismic 
the applicability of seismic has been expanded greatly over the past decade 
where standard d seismic has not been sufficient  our advanced techniques have been used on certain geologic problems with spectacular results  as exemplified by the delineation and discovery of the large sub salt reservoirs in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
while the increases in petroleum consumption may change from year to year  overall consumption seems to be on a continuous climb upward 
similarly  new  economic oil reserves seem to be increasingly difficult to find  especially in areas of low political risk 
with this supply and demand situation  we are reasonably confident that exploration spending will continue to rise  but more importantly  we expect that more of that spending will be directed toward areas of geophysical difficulty  requiring the high end seismic services that we provide 
in this improving business environment  our strategy to maximize performance has been to continue the long term commitment to building multi client data libraries in areas such as the gulf of mexico  the north sea and onshore canada and the united states  invest in data processing and research resources to maintain leadership in subsurface imaging through continuous innovation  target innovative and higher margin marine acquisition contracts in selected regions  and focus our land acquisition resources on the north american and oman markets and be selective with contracts in latin america 
we expect to continue this balanced contract and multi client strategy through fiscal due to our selling and operational efforts and the more robust seismic market  we have seen our backlog increase million from million at july  to million at july  we expect to complete most of the work in backlog over the next twelve months 
we believe that our traditional pattern of revenue generation will occur again during fiscal  with revenues in our second and third fiscal quarters being higher than in our first and fourth quarters 
this pattern is driven by end of calendar year spending  which results in higher library revenue in our second fiscal quarter and higher land acquisition activity during our second and third fiscal quarters  corresponding with the winter seismic season in alaska and canada 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we reorganized our company into three geographic regions north and south america nasa  europe  africa  middle east and the commonwealth of independent states eame  and asia pacific apac and our financial statements and presentation of segment data for prior periods have been realigned to conform to this revised organization structure 
the managers of these regions are responsible for all facets of sales and operations and are the primary point of contact with our customer within each region 
centrally managed processing  acquisition  and reservoir professionals support these managers from locations around the globe 
we feel this new organization structure allows our front line managers to focus exclusively on their customers while allowing our company to develop and deploy technology consistently across our markets 
we have put processes in place that will allow for the free movement of our seismic equipment across the three regions so that we may maximize our return on investment 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was driven by increased contract work  primarily marine  in all regions and increased sales of multi client data licenses in eame partially offset by decreased sales of multi client data licenses primarily in the nasa region  which includes the gulf of mexico  the united states  brazil and canada 
during fiscal  nasa significantly decreased its land acquisition operations in south america 
nasa s increase in contract marine work was primarily in the gulf of mexico where the veritas vantage and two additional third party vessels acquired a wide azimuth survey during fiscal apac s revenue increase was also generated by marine contract work  as we operated the veritas viking ii  the pacific sword and veritas searcher in australia  india  myanmar and new zealand during the period 
eame generated most of its increased revenue through sales of multi client data licenses for offshore africa and the north sea 
revenues from our operating segments were as follows years ended july  change in millions nasa eame apac total revenues segment information has been changed to reflect our current organization see note of notes to consolidated financial statements revenues consisted of the following years ended july  change in millions multi client land marine subtotal contract land marine subtotal total revenues operating income loss 
operating income increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we changed our multi client amortization accounting policy to include a minimum amortization from the date of survey completion  instead of only during the last months of the survey s book life 
as a result of this change  we recorded a charge of million in cost of services in the first quarter of fiscal the remaining million increase in operating income from fiscal is the result of increased margins revenues less cost of services of million partially offset by increased research and development costs and general and administrative costs 
our margin increase was primarily due to our revenue increase and a decrease in cost of services as a percent of revenue of approximately 
increased productivity  favorable mix of jobs and higher pricing contributed to the margin increase 
research and development costs have increased by million from fiscal primarily due to our focus on advanced acquisition and processing and general increases in research spending 
general and administrative expense increased by million due to the expenses associated with the restatement of our historical financial statements and those associated with our increased efforts in the areas of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over our financial reporting 
research and development expense and general and administrative expense both grew due to increased incentive compensation related to our improved financial performance 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease is due primarily to the issuance of our convertible senior notes in the third quarter of fiscal and the repayment of our term notes with the proceeds 
this refinancing resulted in a significantly lower interest rate 
our convertible senior notes accrue interest at a rate of three month libor less  which equated to a weighted average interest rate of for fiscal and is much lower than the various tranches of debt in place in fiscal in addition  approximately million of debt issuance costs were expensed in fiscal in connection with the retirement of the term notes 
involuntary conversion of assets 
in january  our seismic vessel veritas viking experienced an engine failure while acquiring data in the gulf of mexico and lost substantial amounts of overboard seismic equipment 
as this seismic equipment was insured at its replacement cost  we recognized a million gain related to this insurance settlement 
other income expense  net 
in fiscal  other income increased to million from million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased interest income of million earned on our cash balances augmented by a small foreign currency exchange gain in fiscal income taxes 
we reversed million of valuation allowances on certain of our deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in a net tax benefit of million for fiscal the deferred tax assets were originally reserved at the end of fiscal primarily due to our historical losses in several tax jurisdictions 
as of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had recognized profits in those jurisdictions and had a positive operational outlook 
the combination of these two factors was sufficient to cause the reversal of the reserves 
this decrease in provision was offset  in part  by the increased current tax provision resulting from substantially higher income in fiscal excluding the release of valuation allowances  our effective tax rate would have been approximately 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal increased multi client revenues were responsible for most of the growth  with all three regions showing substantial increases 
contract revenues increased by 
in the nasa region  land contract acquisition work increased in north america but was offset by declines in south america 
in response to the south american decline  we are reducing our presence in that region and redeploying our assets and key personnel into other markets 
marine contract acquisition revenues increased overall  but we experienced a significant regional shift as we moved the veritas viking ii from nasa to apac 
revenues from our current operating segments were as follows years ended july  change in millions nasa eame apac total revenues segment information has been changed to reflect our current organization see note of notes to consolidated financial statements revenues consisted of the following years ended july  change in millions multi client land marine subtotal contract land marine subtotal total revenues operating income loss 
operating income increased by million  from a loss of million in fiscal to operating income of million in fiscal fiscal included charges of million related to asset impairments and reserves while fiscal included a million charge related to a change in accounting for our multi client library 
the difference in the amount of these charges had the effect of increasing our operating income by million 
the remaining million increase in operating income is the result of increased multi client margins of million  increased contract margins of million and reduced general and administrative costs of million  partially offset by million of additional research and development spending 
in fiscal  contract margin included a million charge to establish a reserve against an account receivable from one of our customers 
this receivable was settled in the first quarter of fiscal resulting in a gain of million 
research and development expense in fiscal increased by million from fiscal a substantial amount of the increase was due to work on multi component pressure and shear wave acquisition and processing 
we spent the majority of our research budget on developing advanced processing techniques 
general and administrative expense in fiscal decreased by million from fiscal the decrease was due primarily to lower severance cost in fiscal  partially offset by expenses associated with requirements of the sarbanes oxley act and related rules 
the fiscal charge of million  as described above  is included in cost of services on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss and relates to a change in accounting for our multi client library 
this charge represents the adjustment necessary to reduce each of our surveys as of august   the first day of fiscal  to a balance no greater than that which would have been recorded had we been using the new method 
while the sales forecast method remains our primary means of expensing multi client surveys  we have now established a minimum cumulative amortization for each survey based upon straight line amortization over five years 
the monthly expense recognized for each survey is the greater of the amount derived by the sales forecast method or the amount of minimum amortization 
this is a change from the prior method that provided for a minimum amortization only during the last two years of the survey s book life 
the fiscal charge of million includes an impairment of multi client surveys of million  impairment and severance expense related to the sale of rc  our reservoir characterization software business  of million  and an impairment charge for goodwill of million  with each charge described more fully below 
we periodically review the carrying value of the multi client data library to assess whether there has been a permanent impairment of value and record losses when it is determined that estimated sales would not be sufficient to cover the carrying value of the asset 
in fiscal  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge related to a survey in the gulf of mexico that we have been unable to license 
this survey was acquired at right angles to an existing survey and customers have not been willing to pay for the moderately increased resolution 
we had not been satisfied with the results of the software operation acquired with the rc business in february we were not making the software sales projected in our acquisition plan and were ineffective at bringing any new products to market 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to sell this operation and entered into a letter of intent with seismic micro technology  inc  a company more focused on software development 
we took a charge in fiscal year of million related to these operations  of which million was applied to reduce the carrying value of the rc software to its estimated market value of million 
the remaining million primarily related to employee severance and facility costs 
the sales agreement allows us to continue using the rc suite of software in our reservoir consulting business 
in addition  we have entered into an agreement that allows us to continue as sales agents of the software 
the sale closed in september our reduced earnings in fiscal year  coupled with the instability in our industry  led to a sharp decline in our stock price in fiscal year  leaving our market value below our book value 
as a result of our continued weak stock price and the sale of the rc software business  we performed an evaluation of our existing goodwill balance at the end of fiscal this analysis indicated our goodwill was impaired and  as a result  we recognized an impairment charge of million  an amount equal to our entire goodwill balance 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes decreased by million from fiscal to fiscal due principally to two reasons 
first  fiscal was negatively impacted by unbenefited net operating losses  non deductibility of our goodwill impairment and increased valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
second  fiscal was positively affected by the reduction of certain tax contingencies and resolution of certain tax matters in early calendar year  due to the extended open period of fiscal caused by our restatement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses our internal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and cash flow from operations 
external sources include public and private debt financing  equity sales  equipment financing and our revolving loan facility and trade credit 
we believe that our current cash balance and cash flow from operations are adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months 
net cash provided by operating activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to improved profitability and improvements in working capital 
net cash used by investing activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our cash investment for fiscal includes capital expenditures to replace and upgrade our existing equipment of approximately million and investment in our data library of approximately million 
we expect to continue to fund these investments from our current cash and cash equivalents on hand and from internally generated funds 
for the past three fiscal years  cash provided by our operating activities has increased while combined expenditures for capital equipment and multi client surveys have not increased at the same rate 
we expect spending to increase modestly in fiscal  but also expect that cash provided by operating activities will again exceed our investment in our operations 
for fiscal  we expect capital expenditures of approximately million and cash multi client library investment of approximately million for a combined investment of approximately million 
these amounts are relatively flexible and will be adjusted to meet the needs of the business 
in addition to these amounts  we plan to spend approximately million for research and development during fiscal while we believe that we have adequate sources of funds to meet our liquidity needs  our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance  which is subject to many factors beyond our control 
key internal factors affecting future results include utilization levels of acquisition and processing assets and the level of multi client data library licensing  all of which are driven by the external factors of spending by exploration and production companies and  ultimately  underlying commodity prices 
debt structure our long term debt consists of million of convertible senior notes due in addition  we have a credit facility consisting primarily of a revolving loan facility permitting borrowings of up to million and various unsecured lines of credit totaling million 
the convertible senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are convertible under certain circumstances into a combination of cash and our common stock 
in general  upon conversion of a note  the holder of such note will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and shares of our common stock for the note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
we entered into a registration rights agreement in which we agreed to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission within days of march  to register resales of the notes and associated shares of common stock 
we filed a registration statement on may  in compliance with the registration rights agreement  however  the registration statement was not effective until august  because our registration statement was not effective on august  as required by the indenture  we incurred liquidated damages in the aggregate amount of million in fiscal the convertible senior notes bear interest at a per annum rate which is equal to the three month libor rate  adjusted quarterly  minus a spread of 
the interest rate of the notes  from september  through december   is  based on a libor rate of 
for fiscal the weighted average interest rate was approximately the notes will mature on march  and may not be redeemed by us prior to march  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some  or all  of the notes on march   and they could also require repurchase upon a change of control as defined in the indenture under which the convertible senior notes were issued 
under certain circumstances and at the option of the holder  the convertible senior notes are convertible prior to the maturity date into cash and shares of our common stock 
certain of these circumstances may result in classification of the convertible senior notes as current on our balance sheet 
these circumstances include if the closing sale price of our common stock is over of the conversion price  which is currently with being for trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the fiscal quarter preceding the quarter in which the conversion occurs  if we called the notes for redemption and the redemption has not occurred  the occurrence of a five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the notes was less than of the closing sale price of our common stock on such day multiplied by the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes  or the occurrence of specified corporate transactions 
should any of these circumstances occur  the convertible senior notes would be convertible at the then current stock price times the conversion ratio of 
this amount would be payable in cash equal to the principal amount of the notes  the par value adjusted for dividends or other equity transactions  with the additional amount payable in shares of our common stock 
currently  the maximum amount payable by us on conversion is million in cash plus approximately million shares 
for clarity  conversion at a stock price would result in our payment of million in cash and million shares of common stock 
this settlement method is prescribed in the indenture and is not optional at the discretion of any party 
the shares issuable from such conversion are considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
given the recent market price for shares of our common stock  it is reasonable to assume that our debt may become convertible as soon as the second quarter of fiscal should our stock price remain above the current conversion price  we would not expect any notes to be converted  however  we would have to classify the notes as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
on february   we entered into a credit facility with deutsche bank ag  new york branch  as administrative agent  deutsche bank ag  canada branch  as canadian administrative agent  and certain other lending institutions 
in addition to term loans  which have been retired  the credit facility provided a revolving loan facility aggregating million  including a facility for swing line loans of up to million and the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to million 
in august  the limit for the issuance of letters of credit was increased to million 
loans made under the revolving loan facility  including swing line loans  bear interest at a variable rate determined on the date of borrowing that is related to various base rates and margins depending upon our leverage ratio and the location of the borrowing 
the revolving loan facility expires in february the credit facility prohibits us from  among other things  paying cash dividends 
as of july   there were no borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility  leaving million available for borrowings 
in addition to the revolving loan facility  we have various unsecured lines of credit with lending institutions that operate in geographic areas not covered by the lending institutions in our credit facility  totaling million that may be used exclusively for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees 
as of july   million in letters of credit were outstanding under these lines 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by assets  including equipment  vehicles  multi client data library  intellectual property  and stock of certain material subsidiaries  owned by us and certain of our subsidiaries 
at july  the carrying value of the secured assets  including intercompany receivables  was billion 
the credit facility and related documents contain a number of covenants  including financial covenants relating to interest coverage  leverage and net worth 
these covenants relate to measurements as of quarter ending dates  as of july   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
during fiscal  we obtained waivers from our lenders under the credit facility related to the late filing of our financial statements 
the waivers allowed us to deliver our required reports for fiscal and for the first three quarters of fiscal later than required under the agreement 
all required financial statements for such periods have now been provided to our lenders under the credit facility 
the following table presents our contractual obligations as of july  for the specified periods payments due contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt estimated interest payments operating leases purchase obligations potential payments under letters of credit other long term liabilities under certain circumstances the convertible senior notes are convertible prior to maturity 
certain of these circumstances may result in classification of the convertible senior notes as current on our balance sheet 
the interest rate on our debt is libor less 
for purposes of this table  we used our current interest rate of based on a libor rate of 
each basis point increase in libor will increase our annual interest expense by million per year 
includes income tax  deferred revenue  pension and retirement obligations for which the timing of payment is uncertain 
off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we had no off balance sheet instruments 
during fiscal  our limited hedging program consisted of economic hedge instruments intended to fix the us dollar value of foreign currency payments to be made under a certain customer agreements 
critical accounting policies while all of our accounting policies are important in assuring that we adhere to current accounting standards  certain policies are particularly important due to their impact on our financial statements or the degree of subjectivity inherent in the assumptions required by the policies 
these are described in detail below 
revenue recognition customer contracts for our services vary in terms and conditions 
we review the deliverables in each contract and  where applicable  apply the accounting guidance contained in eitf  accounting for revenue contracts with multiple deliverables eitf 
for contract services  we recognize revenues on a proportional performance method based upon output measures as work is performed 
this method requires that we recognize revenues based upon quantifiable measures of progress  such as kilometers shot or processed 
in contracts where our customer pays separately for the mobilization of equipment  eitf requires us to recognize such mobilization fees as revenue during the performance of the seismic acquisition  using the same proportional performance method as for the acquisition work 
revenues from the licensing of multi client surveys are based upon agreed rates set forth in the contract and are recognized upon physical delivery of  or customer access to  the surveys 
during the acquisition and processing phase of a multi client survey  in most cases we recognize revenues on in process multi client surveys after obtaining a signed license agreement that gives the customers access to survey results as they occur  based upon a proportional performance method  using quantifiable measures of progress  such as kilometers shot or processed 
after completion of a multi client survey  we recognize revenues upon delivery of  or customer access to  the data to our customer or the customer s designee 
provisions exist in certain contracts with our customers that provide for a full refund if certain deadlines are not met or provide for a revenue sharing arrangement with the customer such that the final sales price is not fixed or determinable 
for contracts with these provisions  we do not recognize the revenue under the proportional performance method for that contract and  instead  defer revenue recognition until performance is complete or the sales price is fixed or determinable 
multi client data library we collect and process geophysical data for our own account and retain all ownership rights 
we license the data to clients on a non transferable basis 
in some circumstances  we have sold on a non exclusive basis rights to data prior to our collecting and processing such data  ie  we have made the first of what we anticipate will be multiple discrete sales of licenses to the same data 
we capitalize costs associated with acquiring and processing the data as an investment in our multi client data library 
the capitalized costs of multi client data are charged to cost of services in the period sales of licenses occur based upon the greater of the percentage of total costs to total estimated sales for the first five years multiplied by actual sales  a process called the sales forecast method  or five year straight line amortization from the date of survey completion 
the sales forecast method is our primary method of calculating cost of services 
we believe this method of amortizing the capitalized costs aligns the amount of amortization to the period in which the economic benefits of the capitalized costs are consumed 
estimated sales are determined based upon discussions with our clients  our experience and our knowledge of industry trends 
changes in sales estimates may have the effect of changing the percentage relationship of cost of services to revenues 
in applying the sales forecast method  an increase in the projected sales of a survey will result in lower cost of services as a percentage of revenue  and higher earnings when revenue associated with that particular survey is recognized  while a decrease in projected sales will have the opposite effect 
assuming that the overall volume of sales  mix of surveys generating revenue in the period and minimum amortization amounts were held constant in fiscal  an increase of in the sales forecasts of all of our surveys would have decreased our cost of services by less than  or approximately million 
our ability to accurately forecast sales of our library surveys for several years into the future is affected by unforeseeable changes in commodity prices  exploration success in the area of the survey and the overall investment decisions of our customers 
therefore  we update our sales forecast for surveys with a significant book value on a quarterly basis to ensure that the most current market information is considered 
the total amortization period of months represents the minimum period over which benefits from these surveys are expected to be derived 
we have determined the amortization period of months based upon our historical experience that indicates that the majority of our revenues from multi client surveys are derived during the acquisition and licensing phases and during the years subsequent to survey completion 
any future decrease in the minimum amortization period would have the effect of increasing cost of services and reducing the carrying value of the multi client data library 
we periodically review the carrying value of the multi client data library to assess whether there has been a permanent impairment of value and record losses when it is determined that estimated sales would not be sufficient to cover the carrying value of the asset 
any future reductions in sales estimates may result in an impairment charge that increases cost of services and reduces the carrying value of the multi client data library 
for example  in fiscal  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge related to a survey in the gulf of mexico that we had been unable to license 
deferred tax asset deferred taxes result from the effect of transactions that are recognized in different periods for financial and tax reporting purposes 
a valuation allowance  by tax jurisdiction  is established when it is more likely than not that at least some portion of the related deferred tax asset will not be realized 
this valuation allowance is then adjusted if realization of the related deferred tax asset subsequently becomes more likely than not 
during fiscal  our valuation allowances decreased million  million of which was due to the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances  million of which was due to the net utilization of fully reserved deferred tax assets and million of which was due to expiration of fully reserved deferred tax assets during the period 
as of july   we had million of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where historical losses indicate realization is doubtful 
since our quasi reorganization on july  with respect to digicon inc  the tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the quasi reorganization have been recognized through a direct addition to additional paid in capital  when realization is more likely than not 
additionally  the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the quasi reorganization is subject to certain limitations 
during fiscal  we did not recognize any amount related to these benefits 
software capitalization and amortization software available for sale is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
software acquired through the purchase of software companies is capitalized at its estimated fair market value through the allocation of the purchase price 
for internally developed software  we capitalize costs associated with the development of the product from the time the product reaches technological feasibility until it is ready for commercial release 
the amortization of capitalized software is the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on 
the period of amortization begins when the software is released to the market 
estimated useful lives of our software products range from three to five years 
estimated sales are determined based upon discussions with our clients  our experience and our knowledge of industry trends 
changes in sales estimates will have the effect of changing cost of services 
an increase in projected sales will result in lower cost of services as a percentage of sales and higher earnings 
a decrease in projected sales will result in higher cost of services as a percentage of sales and lower earnings 
any future increases or decreases in our estimates of useful lives will have the effect of decreasing or increasing future cost of services with an inverse effect on earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements we maintain stock based compensation plans that are accounted for using the intrinsic value based method allowed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under that method  compensation expense is recorded in the consolidated financial statements when the quoted market price of the underlying stock at the grant date or other measurement date exceeds the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
our plans do not permit us to grant stock options at a price lower than market  therefore  we do not record any compensation expense related to stock options 
in december  the financial accounting standards board released sfas no 
r  a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r  which will become effective for us beginning with our first quarter of fiscal  will require us to record the cost of stock options and other equity based compensation in our income statement based upon the estimated fair value of those awards 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we disclose the pro forma effect of stock based compensation expense on net income and earnings per share that would have been recorded had we used the fair value based method 
as presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  adoption of sfas no 
r will likely reduce our reported net income or increase our reported net loss in future periods 
risk factors as a provider of geophysical technologies  our business is substantially dependent on the level of exploration expenditures by oil and gas companies 
exploration expenditures by oil and gas companies are affected by several factors  including actual and forecasted petroleum commodity prices and such companies own short term and strategic plans 
these expenditures may also be affected by worldwide economic conditions 
should there be a sustained period of substantially reduced exploration expenditures by oil and gas companies  the demand for geophysical services likely will drop and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow during the affected period 
in recent years  many of our customers have been using a substantial portion of their discretionary cash to pay down debt  buy back their stock  drill low risk prospects and maximize production from existing fields rather than exploring for new prospects 
while we believe this trend has ended  due to recent commodity price increases and current supply and demand forecasts  there can be no guarantee that oil and gas companies will engage in substantial or prolonged exploration programs involving seismic spending 
while petroleum commodity prices are currently high from a historical perspective  history has shown these prices to be very volatile 
weak demand or technological obsolescence could impair the value of our multi client data library 
we have invested significant amounts in acquiring and processing multi client data and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
there is no assurance that we will recover all the costs of such surveys 
technological  regulatory or other industry or general economic developments could render all or portions of our multi client data library obsolete or reduce its value 
for example  in fiscal and fiscal we incurred million and million  respectively  in impairment charges related to slow moving surveys in our multi client library 
these surveys were found to be impaired for various reasons  including slow acreage turnover in the case of us land surveys  a border dispute in the case of a shetland faroes survey and excessive acquisition cost in the case of a gulf of mexico survey 
additionally  our individual surveys have a book life of five years  so particular surveys may be subject to significant amortization even though sales of licenses associated with that survey are weak or non existent  thus reducing our profits 
we are dependent on achieving and maintaining technological advances  which creates risks regarding technological obsolescence  requirements for substantial future capital expenditures  the unavailability of necessary technology and the failure of new technologies 
the development of geophysical data acquisition and processing equipment has been characterized by rapid technological advancements in recent years 
we expect this trend to continue 
we will be required to invest substantial capital in the future to maintain our technology 
furthermore  manufacturers of geophysical equipment may develop new systems that render our equipment  even if recently acquired  obsolete or less desirable  requiring significant additional capital expenditures 
because some of our competitors are themselves leading designers and manufacturers of seismic equipment  we may not have access to their technology 
even if critical new and advanced equipment is available to us  we may not have funds available or be able to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms to acquire it 
further  any investment we may make in a perceived technological advance may not be effective  economically successful or otherwise accepted in the market 
we face intense competition in our industry  which could adversely affect our results 
competition among geophysical service providers historically has been  and we expect will continue to be  intense 
competitive factors in recent years have included price  crew experience  equipment availability  technological expertise and reputation for quality  safety and dependability 
some of our competitors operate substantially more data acquisition crews and have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
these larger and better financed operators could enjoy an advantage over us in a competitive environment for contract awards and data sales and in the development of new technologies 
other competitors operate with extremely low overhead and compete vigorously on price in certain markets where that is the determining factor in awarding work 
these low cost competitors can have a competitive advantage over us in these markets 
high fixed costs could result in operating losses 
our business has high fixed costs 
as a result  downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand  weather interruptions  equipment failures or other causes can result in significant operating losses 
low utilization rates may hamper our ability to recover the cost of necessary capital investments 
our revenues are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control  which could adversely affect our results of operations in any financial period 
our operating results vary in material respects from quarter to quarter and will most likely continue to do so in the future 
factors that cause variations include the timing of the receipt and commencement of contracts for data acquisition  customers budgetary cycles  the timing of offshore lease sales and the effect of such timing on the demand for geophysical activities  seasonal factors and the timing of sales of licenses to geophysical data in our multi client data library  which may be significant to us and which are not typically made in a linear or consistent pattern 
combined with our high fixed costs  these revenue fluctuations could produce unexpected adverse results of operations in any fiscal period 
we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  which could adversely affect our business 
our success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and technical personnel 
a number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians  and our failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the geophysical services industry 
we may confront significant and potentially adverse competition for key personnel  particularly during periods of increased demand for geophysical services 
in addition  our success will depend to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of members of our senior management  the loss of whom could adversely affect our business 
we face risks associated with our foreign revenue generating activities 
substantial portions of our revenues are derived from foreign activities 
during the fiscal year ended july   approximately of our revenue  or million  was attributable to activities outside the united states 
during the fiscal year ended july   we recognized revenue from customers residing in the following foreign countries that represented more than of our consolidated revenue on a gross basis for the fiscal year country of origin revenue in millions australia brazil canada india malaysia nigeria norway oman south africa united kingdom foreign revenues are subject to certain risks  including those related to rates of currency exchange  border disputes  war  terrorism  civil disturbances  embargo  and government activities such as radical changes in tax regulations or investment laws 
we are exposed to these risks in all of our foreign operations to some degree  and our exposure could be material to our financial condition and results of operations where the political and legal environment is less stable and we generate significant revenue or have large local investments  such as in brazil  nigeria  and oman 
revenue generating activities in certain foreign countries may require prior united states government approval in the form of an export license and otherwise be subject to tariffs and import export restrictions 
these laws change over time and may result in limitations on our ability to compete globally 
in addition  non us persons employed by our separately incorporated foreign subsidiaries conduct business in foreign jurisdictions  some of which have been subject to us trade embargoes and have been identified by the us government as state sponsors of terrorism or are subject to sanctions by the us office of foreign assets control 
for example  during fiscal we generated million of revenue from libyan customers libya was identified by the us government as a state sponsor of terrorism until september  million of revenue from iranian customers and  of revenue from a syrian customer 
we have typically generated revenue in these countries through the performance of data processing  reservoir consulting services and the sale of software licenses and software maintenance 
the governments of iran and syria have been identified by the us government as state sponsors of terrorism and are subject to sanctions by the us office of foreign assets control and either directly or indirectly control the activities of our customers within their borders 
our relations with customers in these countries are current and on going 
we have procedures in place to conduct these operations in compliance with applicable us laws 
however  failure to comply with us laws on foreign operations could result in material fines and penalties  damage to our reputation  and a reduction in the value of our shares of common stock 
in addition  our activities in these countries could reduce demand for our stock among certain investors 
finally  some of our operational activities result in accounts receivable or accounts payable that are denominated in foreign currencies and  therefore  subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties in connection with future foreign revenue generation and  in particular  adverse effects from foreign currency fluctuations 
we operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personal injuries and may interrupt our business 
our seismic data acquisition activities involve operating under extreme weather and other hazardous conditions 
these operations are subject to risks of loss to property and injury to personnel from fires  accidental explosions  ice floes  and high seas 
these types of events could result in an interruption of our business or significant liability 
we may not obtain insurance against all risks or for certain equipment located from time to time in certain areas of the world 
the trading price of our securities could be subject to significant fluctuations 
the trading prices of our securities fluctuate 
factors such as fluctuations in our financial performance  and that of our competitors  as well as general market conditions could have a significant impact on the future trading prices of our securities 
the trading prices also may be affected by weakness in oil prices  changes in interest rates and other factors beyond our control 
any one or combination of these factors may cause a decline in the trading price of our securities 
we may be unable to repurchase our convertible senior notes as required upon a change in control or on the specified dates at the option of the holder or to pay the required cash upon conversion of the notes 
upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture governing our convertible senior notes  and on march   and  the holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase the notes for cash 
in addition  upon conversion of the notes  the holders will have the right to receive a cash payment 
if we do not have sufficient funds to pay the repurchase price for all of the notes tendered upon a change in control  the cash due upon repurchases of the notes on march   or or the cash due upon conversion  an event of default under the indenture governing the notes would occur as a result of such failure 
in addition  cash payments in respect of notes tendered for repurchase or conversion are subject to limits and might be prohibited  or create an event of default  under our credit facility as well as other agreements relating to borrowings that we may enter into from time to time 
our failure to make cash payments in respect of the convertible senior notes could result in an event of default under our credit facility 
there can be no guarantee that our available sources of cash will be sufficient to allow us to make the required cash payments 
our business is subject to governmental regulation  which may adversely affect our future operations or the accounting thereof 
our operations are subject to a variety of federal  provincial  state  foreign and local laws and regulations  including environmental laws 
we invest financial and managerial resources to comply with these laws and related permit requirements 
failure to timely obtain the required permits may result in crew downtime and operating losses 
because laws and regulations change frequently  we cannot predict the impact of government regulations on our future operations 
the adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of curtailing exploration by oil and gas companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our geophysical services 
we follow the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states gaap as promulgated and or enforced by the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission and other organizations 
gaap is subject to change  with such changes occurring at a rapid rate in recent years 
changes in gaap can affect the reporting of our future results 
certain provisions of our charter  delaware law and our shareholder rights plan may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even in situations that may be viewed as desirable by our stockholders 
the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that may delay or prevent an attempt by a third party to acquire control of our company 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that authorize the issuance of preferred stock  and establish advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be taken at stockholder meetings 
these provisions could also discourage or impede a tender offer  proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us  even if viewed favorably by stockholders 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that would likely discourage a hostile attempt to acquire control of us 
the amounts we amortize from our data library each period may fluctuate significantly  and these fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results of operations 
how we account for our multi client data library has a significant effect on our reported results of operations 
we amortize the cost of our multi client library based primarily upon our estimates of future sales of licenses to data  known as the sales forecast method 
although we also employ a minimum amortization for each survey in our data library based on straight line amortization over five years  this amortization is secondary to that derived from the sales forecast method 
the estimates used in the sales forecast method are inherently imprecise and may vary from period to period depending upon market developments and our expectations 
we update our estimates on a quarterly basis and change our amortization rates accordingly 
substantial changes in amortization rates can have a significant effect on our reported results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk as of july   we had million convertible senior notes bearing interest at libor less with a fair value of million  based upon the bid price of on july  these notes are not hedged and represent our total exposure to interest rate risk 
each basis point increase in the libor rate will increase our interest expense by million per year
