the lec billed products do not have any long lived assets associated with the segment 
these direct to consumer generated products and services accounted for approximately million  or of our revenue during the fiscal year ended november   as compared to approximately million  or of our revenue during the fiscal year ended november  such direct to consumer services were inactive in fiscal we also generate revenues from the sales and rentals for use both on line and off line of our proprietary  profiled databases and are included in our e commerce segment 
background from our inception in under the name quintel communications  inc through  we generated the bulk of our revenue from direct marketing using the traditional media of television  postal mail and telemarketing 
in  we repositioned our direct marketing business to the on line media of the web 
applying the marketing disciplines honed from our years of operating in the off line media arena  we have been able to provide enhanced response based results in a cost effective and scaleable manner via on line marketing

com 
our prizedistributors  inc sponsored group of websites offers consumers the opportunity to win up to million daily in our free  on line sweepstakes 
the sweepstakes prizes are indemnified by an independent  third party agency 
during the fiscal year ended november  we expended approximately million for such sweepstakes indemnification  as compared to million in fiscal the primary factor contributing to the decline in indemnification costs was attributable to a restructuring of our sweepstake opportunities which reduced the indemnifiers payout exposure 
in order to play  each consumer must provide complete and accurate registration information and agree to receive opt in marketing messages from us and our marketing partners 
we own and operate several other websites such as atlascreditgroup 
com  thebargainspot 
com  altasautomotivegroup 
com  takeentertainment 
com  prizecade 
com and jewelclaimcenter 
com 
each of these sites is designed to appeal to a specific consumer interest category that we match with client promotions that appeal to such interest category 
email marketing 
each program that we market for our clients can be implemented not only through the websites  but also  and often  through email marketing 
we currently market to a vast database  which includes consumer data that is either owned by us or is managed by us under our revenue share arrangements  whereby we recognize the gross revenue as earned and bear the payment obligation to the list owner  irrespective of receipt of payment from our clients 
results analysis 
even after campaigns are fully implemented  we continually analyze the marketing results to gauge whether the campaigns are continuing to generate adequate results for the client  whether the media is being utilized cost efficiently  and to determine whether new and different copy is yielding better overall results 
these are traditional direct marketing disciplines that we apply and that we believe distinguish us from many of our competitors in the on line marketing industry 
syndication 
after we develop a campaign that works efficiently on our own media  we sometimes syndicate the program to third party media 
typically  we have expended time  media and other costs in developing certain campaigns 
in exchange for this invested effort  we obtain the right to market those campaigns to other on line media companies 
we believe that with syndicated offers we can leverage campaigns we have developed so that in future fiscal periods we can generate additional revenue with reduced costs and risks associated with such business extension 
products and services we introduced several new business units during fiscal  and further expanded those new business units in fiscal  including an on line dating program conducted over the internet imatchup 
com  included in our e commerce segment  and internet based service products  such as a pc home user technical support service  an isp service and email accounts  that are lec billed click help  txnet and worldwideaccess  inc 
these business units are designed as monthly recurring billing programs  such as membership to imatchup

revenue from these businesses is generated primarily from billing consumers directly 
imatchup 
com became a significant source of revenue for us in fiscal  generating almost of our total revenue for fiscal our expansion in  and dependence on  our on line direct marketing efforts  coupled with the potential for state and or federal legislation limiting our ability to contact consumers on line should all be considered when referring to our current fiscal year s results  as well as prior year s historical results  in evaluating the potential for our future operations  cash flows and financial position

segment information during the fiscal year ended november   we generated revenue from the following segments e commerce and lec billed products 
the e commerce segment currently represents the core of our business operations 
revenue in the e commerce segment is generated primarily from marketing of third party products and services on our websites  through email and search engine marketing campaigns  and also from sales of memberships to our on line dating service 
lec billed products consist of our proprietary lec billed products  known as click help  txnet isp and worldwebaccess  inc these products were introduced during the fiscal years ended november  and the off line marketing services segment consisted of revenue generated by us through off line direct marketing channels  and which was earned exclusively in fiscal through our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management  llc  which was sold in fiscal during the fiscal year ended november   we generated revenue only from the e commerce and off line marketing services segments 
historically  off line marketing service segment s activities consisted of telemarketing services used for the acquisition of long distance and wireless phone customers for various phone service providers 
during the fiscal years ended november  and  this segment consisted exclusively of our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management  llc  and the revenues and expenses of montvale s net branch services provided to qualified mortgage banking and lending institutions 
in march  we disposed of our interest in montvale  all as more fully described in note included in the attached financial statements

e commerce segment revenue had a net increase of approximately million on a comparative basis with the prior year  attributable primarily to increases in website advertising revenue  with the total increase in e commerce revenue of million including million in revenue earned from our july  acquisition of the assets of a search engine marketing business  sendtraffic  com  inc sendtraffic 
search engine revenue is shown after intercompany eliminations 
net revenue in our lec billed product segment increased million  to million  resulting from increased marketing and enrollments into our various lec products during the first six months of fiscal  as compared to approximately million in revenue for the prior year s comparable period 
offsetting the foregoing revenue increases was a decline in net revenue that resulted from the sale of our majority owned subsidiary montvale management  llc during the quarter ended may  such subsidiary accounted for approximately million of our off line marketing service segment revenue  or of our consolidated revenue during the year ended november  our e commerce segment s net revenue included approximately million in online revenue earned by montvale in fiscal in total  montvale accounted for million  or  of revenue during the year ended november  our cost of sales during the years ended november  and were comprised of direct and indirect marketing costs associated with the acquisition and retention of consumers for our marketing programs  including direct response email marketing costs  website registrations  customer profiles  other customer acquisition costs such as outbound telemarketing  promotional and creative costs  and premium fulfillment costs  and the related contingent based sweepstakes indemnification expense  billing and collection fees and customer service costs

this e commerce segment cost increase is attributable to two factors a net increase in costs of approximately million from our core revenue generating activities  and the inclusion of the cost of revenue generation from our july  acquisition of sendtraffic  with such cost of revenue accounting for million  or of consolidated cost of sales during the year ended november  the e commerce segment net increase in the cost of sales from our core revenue generating activities resulted from an increase of approximately million in costs incurred for website registrations  customer profiles and other costs of online customer acquisitions  all necessary to support our increased e commerce revenue generation  as discussed above  offset by a decrease in email marketing costs of approximately million  related to our decreased use of third party email vendors in the promotion of our email revenue generating opportunities pursuant to declines in margin  which resulted from the isp s increasing their filtering of commercial email messages  regardless of whether the email was permission based  and a decrease in contingent prize indemnification costs of approximately million  attributable to a reduction in the size of the sweepstakes prizes  and the related impact on indemnification pricing 
also  see consolidated gross profit  by segment for a discussion of anticipated future revenue recognition as a result of current period costs incurred 
other increases in cost of sales related to our lec billed products segment  which amounted to approximately million  or an increase of  when compared to the prior year 
during the first six months of the year ended november   we incurred a significant increase in marketing expenditures due to a test marketing campaign utilizing outbound telemarketing for lec billed products segment customer acquisitions 
such marketing expenditures amounted to approximately million during the year ended november  management had anticipated that this marketing effort would have established a base of recurring billed customers that would generate revenues unencumbered by additional marketing costs in future fiscal periods 
subsequent to this assessment  we experienced an increase in the levels of customer service and account cancellations  significantly reducing the future revenue benefits attributable to this lec billed products customer base 
this decline should be considered in the assessment of future fiscal period revenues  as it relates to the lec billed products segment 
we currently do not intend to continue using outbound telemarketing for this business line in future fiscal periods  but do intend to apply the results of this test marketing to market other products and services through this outbound telemarketing channel 
the lec billed products segment does not have any long lived assets associated to the segment 
resulting from the increase levels of cancellations  we experienced an increase in costs of sales due to the associated customer service costs 
our gross profit in terms of dollars  on a segmental basis  and our gross profit percentage  on a segmental basis  for each of the years ended november  and  are set forth below consolidated gross profit  by segment for the year ended november  change inc dec change inc dec e commerce    off line marketing services   lec billed products and services    consolidated totals    consolidated gross profit percentages  by segment for the year ended november  absolute percentage change inc dec relative percentage change inc dec e commerce customer acquisition services lec billed products and services consolidated gross profit percentage consolidated gross profit gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was during the year ended november   compared to in the prior year  representing an absolute percentage point decrease of  or a decrease on a relative basis 
the decline in gross profit is primarily attributable to four factors increased website registration  customer profile and other third party online customer acquisition costs for our websites recognized in our core business  new lec billed products segment customer acquisition marketing efforts  primarily during the first six months of fiscal which effort was curtailed in the third quarter of fiscal  coupled with increased chargeback and related customer service costs attributable to such lec billed products segment customers during the year ended november   our shift in reaction to regulatory changes whereby we migrated a portion of our marketing efforts from higher margin email revenue to lower margin website based revenue  and the gross profit contribution from the sendtraffic asset acquisition during the period july  acquisition date to november   which was approximately after consolidation  transfer pricing and inter company profit eliminations  and was significantly less than the historically recognized gross profit of our core business 
additionally  the impact on gross profit from our imatchup 
com dating sites results from the expensing of the costs of customer acquisition during the period we acquire and expense the free imatchup 
com membership account  while the recognition of the revenue is dependent upon whether or not the free account converts to a paying membership 
the period that a free account may convert to a billable account ranges from one week after acquisition  to as long as two years  and longer  after its initial month of acquisition  based on available historical conversion to billable experience 
therefore  predicated on stabilized acquisition costs in future fiscal periods  we expect that the future conversions of free membership acquisitions to billable members  as well as the anticipated renewal revenues from such acquired customers  should allow us to report improved gross profit margins attributable to such memberships in our e commerce segment in future fiscal periods

fiscal bad debt expense was attributable to one specific customer who accounted for approximately  of bad debt  coupled with an approximate  net decrease in our reserve for smaller accounts 
our allowance for bad debts results from our assessment of the risk of collection embedded in our customer base as described below 
we continuously evaluate the potential of the collectibility of trade receivables by reviewing such factors as deterioration in the operating results  financial condition or bankruptcy filings of our customers 
as a result of this review process  we record adjustments to bad debt provisions recaptures to reflect the related accounts receivable carrying amount to amounts that estimate their probable realizable value 
provisions for bad debts are also recorded resulting from the review of other factors  including a length of time the accounts receivable are past due  and b historical experience and other factors obtained during collection efforts

our comparable prior year s quarter had realized million from such subsidiary sale  the bulk of which related to payments received at closing in march offsetting this decline was the increase in other income resulting from the elimination of minority interest in connection with the sale of this subsidiary 
b partially offsetting this decrease  we collected  in settlement of a prior year s marketing agreement dispute 
the amount collected had originally been charged to our cost of goods sold accounts in fiscal in fiscal  we had expended  as a non refundable prepayment for the delivery of million on line customers to our website properties under the above referenced marketing agreement 
the marketing partner s failure to satisfactorily deliver the requisite number of on line customers to us was the basis for the settlement received by us during the year ended november  c during the year ended november   we settled a florida intangible tax dispute as it related to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the disputed period covered the florida intangible tax years of and the open years were settled with the florida department of revenue for i an intangible tax assessment of  which had been accrued for in our tax provision in a previous fiscal year  ii interest expense of  and iii penalties of  with both being expensed during the year ended november  provision for income taxes we provide for income taxes at the end of each interim period based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 
cumulative adjustments to the tax provision are recorded in the interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective rate is determined 
a final adjustment is made to our provision for income taxes pursuant to the computation of our annual tax provision benefit 
our current year s tax benefit approximates  coupled with pre tax income of approximately  this effective rate relationship of  when compared to our historical effective rate of approximately  results from several offsetting factors 
we recognized tax benefits from the use of approximately million in previously devalued capital loss carryover deferred tax assets 
such prior year devalued capital loss deferred tax assets were utilized in fiscal to offset the tax expense on current year s capital gain income of approximately million 
additionally  we benefited from state tax benefits partially offset by foreign income tax expense 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further details of our tax expense benefit  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  and believe that we have adequately provided for all such tax liabilities 
matters raised upon audit from such jurisdictions may involve substantial amounts and could be material 
management considers it unlikely that resolution of any such matters would have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial statements

we recognized an approximate million increase in data  profile and premium costs 
such increase was attributable to increases in data and profile costs of approximately million  offset by decreases in premium costs of approximately million 
the premium cost decline was related to our loss of a significant customer  which customer s enrollment based marketing program offered a premium to entice enrollments 
we discontinued conducting business with this significant customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal therefore  fiscal was not burdened with such premium obligation costs 
in addition  fiscal received an approximate benefit of million from the reversal of a portion of the prior years related premium accrual 
the increase in data and profile costs in fiscal was mainly attributable to the cost of consumer data and profile acquisitions  both directly associated with our current year increased website activities  specifically at the imatchup 
com website  the atlas websites  prizeamerica 
com and the prizedistributors 
com newly introduced group of sites 
additional increases in the cost of sales were attributable to billing  collection and customer service costs of approximately million associated with our lec billed product activities  which activities were dormant during the fiscal year ended november  the above mentioned increases were offset by an approximate million decrease in email marketing and delivery costs resulting from reduced mailing volumes and improved pricing arrangements with our third party email delivery vendors  and a million decrease in advertising promotion and fulfillment costs associated with the sale of our majority interest in montvale management  llc in the second quarter of fiscal our gross profit and percentage  on a segmental basis  for each of the years ended november  and are set forth below consolidated gross profit  by segment year ended november  change inc dec change inc dec e commerce    off line marketing services    lec billed products and services   consolidated totals    consolidated gross profit percentages  by segment year ended november  absolute percentage change inc dec relative percentage change inc dec e commerce off line marketing services lec billed products and services consolidated gross profit percentage consolidated gross profit percentage gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was during the year ended november   compared to in the prior year s comparable fiscal period  representing an absolute percentage point decrease of  or a decrease on a relative basis 
the decline in gross profit is primarily attributable to increased data acquisition costs for our imatchup 
com on line dating site and increased marketing and related data acquisition costs for our other website properties and the reintroduction of the lec billed products segment activity  which has a gross profit lower than our historical gross profit 
the impact on gross profit from the imatchup 
com service results from the expensing of the costs of customer acquisition during the current period eg we pay a third party website a fee for its generating an imatchup 
com free membership account  while the recognition of the corresponding revenue is dependent upon whether or not a free account converts to a paying membership  the date of such conversion and the type of membership ie  one month  three month or annual memberships

provision for income taxes we provide for income taxes at the end of each interim period based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 
cumulative adjustments to the tax provision are recorded in the interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective rate is determined 
a final adjustment is made to the company s provision for income taxes pursuant to the computation of its annual tax provision benefit 
our current year tax benefit approximates  coupled with pre tax income of approximately  this effective rate relationship  when compared to our historical effective rate of approximately results from several offsetting factors 
we recognized tax benefits from the use of approximately million in previously devalued capital loss carryover deferred tax assets 
such prior year devalued capital loss deferred tax assets were utilized in fiscal to offset the tax expense on current year s capital gain income of approximately million 
additionally  the company benefited from state tax benefits partially offset by foreign income tax expense 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further details of the company s tax expense benefit  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  and believes that it has adequately provided for all such tax liabilities 
matters raised upon audit from such jurisdictions may involve substantial amounts and could be material 
management considers it unlikely that resolution of any such matters would have a material adverse effect upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of november   we had aggregate working capital of million compared to aggregate working capital of million as of november  we had available cash  cash equivalents and readily available marketable debt securities of million as of november   compared to available cash  cash equivalents and readily available marketable debt securities of million as of november  the equity component of our marketable securities was million at november   compared to million at november  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended november   compared to approximately million in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended november   representing an approximate million increase in cash provided by operating activities 
the primary factor giving rise to the increase in cash provided by operating activities relates to net income of million earned during the year ended november   when compared to a net income of million earned during the prior year s comparable period 
cash used in investing activities was approximately million during the year ended november   compared to million used in investing activities during the year ended november  the primary use of cash in investing activities during the year ended november   related to the use of approximately million expended in the sendtraffic asset acquisition on july  additionally  cash was generated from the excess of short term marketable debt securities maturities in excess of repurchases made on our behalf by our professional money managers amounting to approximately million  and approximately million paid for capital expenditures and an intangible license asset  with both being offset by the collection of approximately million on installments from the prior year s sale of one of our subsidiaries 
the prior year s comparable period used cash of approximately million  approximately million of which was used for the acquisition of short term marketable debt securities purchased for us by our professional money managers  approximately million was provided from proceeds received from the sale of a subsidiary  and approximately million was used for capital expenditures payments 
cash used for financing activities was approximately million during the year ended november   compared to million used by financing activities during the year ended november  during the year ended november  we declared and paid four quarterly dividends  amounting to approximately million and offset such outflows with approximately million in proceeds from stock options exercised

our days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable at november  was days  compared to days at august   days at may   days at february   and days at november  the decrease in the current quarter s dso compared to the third quarter of the current fiscal year relates to the reductions in the lec billed products segment accounts receivable  when comparing november  million lec billed products accounts receivable to august  million 
the collection cycles attributable to our lec billed products segment activities are longer than that which is recognized in our e commerce segment 
our dso may rise above days in future fiscal periods primarily in the event of growth in revenues from our lec billed products segment 
the majority of our customers are extended day credit terms 
in limited instances  customer credit is extended to ranges approximating days 
our lec billed products segment collection cycle is a function of the terms of the billing and collection agreements governing such activity 
these collection cycles can exceed days 
we continually monitor customer adherence to their credit terms and constantly strive to improve the effectiveness of our collection efforts with the goal of achieving a dso in the day range 
future fiscal periods might not reflect this goal of a day dso  and might exceed the day dso recognized during the year ended november  historically  our primary cash requirements have been used to fund the cost of advertising and promotion and test marketing new products  services and promotions  with additional funds having been used in the purchasing of equipment and services in connection with the commencement of new business lines  further development of businesses being test marketed and for the development of the equipment infrastructure of subsidiaries organized in fiscal and in fiscal  we executed our on line direct marketing strategy 
our future plans and business strategy may continue to call for our internet based e commerce segment to be our primary operating focus  with such segment generating the material portion of our revenues for the year s ended november  and in fiscal and we expended approximately and million  respectively  for capital expenditures to support our e commerce business 
in fiscal  capital expenditures declined to approximately  as a result of the prior two years of capital expenditures  which yielded excess capacity 
we believe that our current infrastructure is adequate to support our e commerce growth plan  and therefore do not contemplate significant capital expenditure requirements in the near future 
we may  in future fiscal periods  be required to invest significant amounts of capital into our business 
our operations fail to generate sufficient revenue  we could realize a material adverse impact on our capital and liquidity resources resulting from expenditures necessary to generate such revenue  including  but not limited to  expenditures for a marketing campaigns  including media costs and other costs of customer acquisition information  b product development costs  c site development and maintenance and related technology based costs  d potential on line  and or off line  business acquisitions  e costs associated with developing alternative means of email promotion delivery  or f other unexpected and or currently unidentifiable costs 
we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  hot rocket acquisition corp  acquired the assets  other than cash and receivables  and certain of the liabilities  of hot rocket  a privately held on line media and marketing agency  effective as of january  the purchase price was approximately million  comprised of million in shares of our common stock or  shares and million in cash 
in addition  we agreed to pay hot rocket a contingent purchase price of up to million if hot rocket generates an aggregate of million in ebitda as quantified in the agreement over the four year period following the closing 
the contingent purchase price is payable in semi annual and annual installments pursuant to a formula based on the satisfaction of certain graduating ebitda targets 
we may pay  at our option subject to certain conditions and limitations  up to of the contingent purchase price installments that may become payable  in our stock with the share price to be determined on or about the date of its issuance 
on february   we were notified by nasdaq the market upon which our securities are traded that our consummation of the hot rocket transaction violated nasdaq s shareholder approval rules 
nasdaq reasoned that  since the contingent purchase price could potentially include shares aggregating or more of our outstanding stock  shareholder approval was required to be obtained in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rule i c ii 
since the date of such letter  our board has adopted a resolution that  if contingent purchase price payments are made to hot rocket  we will utilize our discretion to make as much of such payments in cash as is necessary to keep the aggregate of all share issuances to hot rocket at a maximum of of our outstanding stock 
nasdaq has notified us that such board action was sufficient to cause us to again be in compliance with nasdaq s shareholder approval rules

com  inc lotn  a privately held company 
we had announced in february that we had entered into an agreement to acquire all of the assets of lotn

as of february   all required installments were received and recorded as realized gain on sale of subsidiary 
based on management s assessment of montvale s future cash flows  after taking into consideration montvale s increased obligations with respect to the note obligations due us  we have deemed it prudent to defer recognition of income on the unpaid portion of the note 
recognition will therefore take place in future periods under the cost recovery method 
in may  we received approximately  representing our gaap basis capital account in such majority owned subsidiary as at november   pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
we also entered into a two year media purchase agreement whereby we agreed to provide certain media lead generation and related services to the continuing owners of montvale for consideration of  per month over the term of the agreement 
as of february   we have collected all of the requisite payments specified under the agreement 
in the fiscal year ended november   the adoption of our internet business plan and strategy prompted us to terminate the marketing of our legacy products and services  which were active at that time 
accordingly  this legacy activity has contributed  in a significantly decreasing degree  to our cash flows and results of operations for the three year fiscal period  december  to november   and did not contribute at all to the operations of fiscal and fiscal this should be considered when using our historical results in evaluating future operations  cash flows and financial position 
nevertheless  we will continue to explore opportunities to offer other off line marketing services  and expect to continue the expansion of our activities within our lec billed products segment 
under currently proposed operating plans and assumptions  management believes that projected cash flows from operations and available cash resources and working capital  as described above  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our known identifiable short term and long term obligations are described below in the obligations and commitments disclosure as required by the securities and exchange commission s the commission release nos 
and and fr  as issued on january  additionally  as we seek to further extend our reach into the e commerce and lec billed product arenas  as well as identifying new and other consumer oriented products and services in the off line arena  we may use existing cash reserves  enter into long term financing arrangements  acquire the assets of privately held companies  or employ other means to finance such diversification  none of which is specifically identifiable or measurable at this time

we incurred approximately  in legal fees from fkiwsbr during the year ended november  transactions with major customers during the fiscal year ended november   we had nine customers in our e commerce segment which  in combination  accounted for approximately million or of consolidated net revenues during such period  and approximately million  or of consolidated net accounts receivable as of november  the nine major customers accounted for        and of consolidated net revenue for the year ended november  during the fiscal year ended november   we had nine customers in our e commerce segment which  in combination  accounted for approximately million  or of consolidated net revenues during such period  and approximately million  or of consolidated net accounts receivable as of november  the nine major customers accounted for        and of consolidated net revenue for the year ended november  regarding the balance of our customer base  no single customer had net revenues that equaled  or exceeded  of consolidated net revenues for the year ended november  during the year ended november   our business model caused us to move away from significant single  or material multiple  customer reliance  and therefore minimized the risk regarding singular customer loss 
during the fiscal year ended november  we had five major customers who accounted for of revenue 
critical accounting policy and accounting estimate discussion in accordance with the commission s release nos 
and and fr issued in december  referencing the commission s statement regarding the selection and disclosure by public companies of critical accounting policies and practices  we have set forth below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies and estimates that could have a material effect on our company s results of operations and cash flows  if general business conditions or individual customer financial circumstances change in an adverse way relative to the policies and estimates used in the attached financial statements or in any forward looking statements contained herewith 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s most significant estimates relate to the accruals for fulfillment redemptions  reserves for uncollectible receivables  reserves for data qualification allowances  recoverability of long lived assets  and the realizability of deferred tax assets 
additionally  the company has potential exposure resulting from pending and or threatened litigation for which the company currently assesses no risk and does not provide for loss 
no provision for loss has been recorded for the potential of currently unknown actions naming the company as defendant in future fiscal periods 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
factors that could effect future results revenue  margin and overhead trends the following charts and subsequent discussion provide the details of a known trend in revenue deterioration that we had experienced through the eight quarterly periods from december  through february   and margin deterioration we have experienced through the period december  through november  our quarterly net revenues for the prior twelve quarterly periods are set forth in the table below quarterly period ended net revenue change from previous quarter february   may   august   november   february   may   august   november   february   may   august   november   our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management  llc  was sold in march this subsidiary added to quarterly revenues as follows quarterly period ended february   may   august   november   february   may  activity sold in march  we have been able to replace a portion of montvale s revenue through a the expansion of our direct to consumer based proprietary products and services  b the expansion of existing client relationships  and c new client contact strategies 
on june  we acquired the assets of sendtraffic  and recorded the revenue generated by such assets for the period july  to november  on a comparative core revenue basis  revenue increased approximately million  or when comparing the year november  with the year ended november  the newly formed subsidiary contributed to quarterly revenue as follows quarterly period ended february  may  august   november   our quarterly overhead  which is the combination of selling expenses  general and administrative expenses  and bad debt expense  for the prior twelve quarterly periods are set forth in the table below quarterly period ended selling expense g a expense bad debt expense total overhead february      may      august      november      february      may      august      november      february      may      august      november      the company s majority owned subsidiary  montvale management  llc  was sold in march such subsidiary contributed to quarterly selling and g a expenses as follows quarter ended february   may   august   november   february   may   the company s wholly owned subsidiary  sendtraffic 
com inc  contributed to quarterly selling  g a and bad debt expenses as follows quarter ended august   november   our quarterly gross profit for the prior twelve quarterly periods are set forth in the table below quarterly period ended gross profit gross profit february   may   august   november   february   may   august   november   february   may   august   november   the decline in gross profit subsequent to the quarter ended february  is predominantly due to the sale of montvale management  which provided services under a net branch agreement with licensed mortgage banking and brokerage companies 
declines after that quarter to the present have resulted from increased website registration  customer profile and other customer acquisition costs  new lec billed products segment customer acquisition marketing efforts  primarily during the first six months of fiscal  our shift in reaction to regulatory changes from higher margin email revenue to lower margin website based revenue  and the gross profit contribution from the sendtraffic acquisition  which was approximately for the fiscal year ended november   significantly less than our historically recognized gross profit 
strategy to return to positive revenue and profit trends we have recently made  and intend to continue to make  large scale expenditures in order to broaden the expense and increase the depth of our profiled consumer marketing database 
due to the restrictions associated with capitalizing and amortizing the costs of acquired data  we expense all such marketing data purchases upon receipt from our third party vendors 
therefore  it is expected that in future fiscal periods we will have expanded our third party corporate client and corporate customer databases  and be in a position to be able to generate revenue that does not bear the burden of the direct cost of the customer profile 
this strategy  coupled with the broadened horizons of revenue generating opportunities that our recent search engine marketing acquisition has made available to us  is anticipated to improve from currently experienced levels 
of course  many market factors exist  and other conditions could arise that could change the expected outcome of our current strategy 
revenue recognition  variable costs  allowances and bad debts revenue we currently earn the material portion of our revenue from the e commerce segment and deem that this reliance will increase in future fiscal periods 
this revenue primarily results from marketing agreements with our marketing partners and corporate customers 
these marketing agreements satisfy the existence of pervasive evidence of an arrangement required under the current revenue recognition rules under staff accounting bulletin sab the provisions of each agreement determine the a pricing characteristics of the revenue generating activity  the specific type of revenue activity ie on line dating membership  website advertising activity  email marketing promotion and terms of lec recurring billed products  and b the method of our delivery obligations to  and acceptance obligations of  our clients and customers  with a and b satisfying the criterion of sab  that sales price is fixed or determinable and delivery has occurred 
as a function of our client and customer acceptance process  we review bank and credit references  business financial statements  personnel financial statements and or obtain corporate officer guarantees if appropriate  all of which satisfy the sab criteria  collectibility is reasonably assured 
based on the revenue recognition criterion discussed above we believe we recognize revenue when it is realizable and earned 
contra revenue at the time revenue is recognized  we provide for an estimate for contractually specified data qualification allowances  when required under the governing marketing agreement 
such data qualification allowances may include allowances for data duplications  invalid addresses  age and country of origin restrictions  and are recorded in a contra revenue account 
our revenues are adjusted in later fiscal periods if actual allowances vary from amounts previously estimated 
historically  variances between actual allowances and previously estimated allowances have been immaterial 
if events were to occur that would cause data qualification actual allowances to vary significantly from those originally estimated and reflected in the financial statements  we could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period gross margins  and  therefore  our profitability  cash flows and capital resources could be adversely affected 
cost of sales certain revenue related obligations are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
they include costs payable to other on line  as well as off line  media companies for advertising  generating registered users and consumer data for us  database fee sharing costs under third party database use agreements  email message delivery costs  contingent based prize indemnification coverage ie  sweepstakes payout indemnification  estimated premium fulfillment costs related to the respective promotion if applicable and all other variable costs directly associated with completing our obligations relative to the revenue being recognized 
if our actual premium fulfillment costs vary from that which were accrued at the time of recording the related revenue we take the additional cost  or benefit  to the accrual adjustment in the fiscal period that the variance is determinable 
the year ended november  included a benefit of approximately  on the adjustment of the premium fulfillment accruals from november  at november   we carried a fulfillment accrual of  based on currently available premium redemption experience 
should the internet operating landscape change resulting in a higher costs of advertising acquiring website registrations  customer profiles and other related customer acquisition costs  b higher costs of acquiring data for our marketing partners  compromising such marketing partners ability to maintain adequate sized databases to allow for continued third party database use agreements  c the infiknowledge asset acquisition failing to maintain a lower cost of our email delivery activities and web development and web hosting service costs as compared to our competitors  or us being required to depend on third party emailing service bureaus  to a degree higher  and or at a cost in excess of our anticipated internally generated costs  than that currently utilized during the year ended november   or other currently unknown third party influences on our ability to deliver email messages to the records in our databases  or the records in our marketing affiliates databases  d a significant reduction in third party advertising dollars spent on the internet  e a material change in the on line dating industry f our contingent based prize indemnification premiums for indemnification coverage increasing due to an increase in the number of prize winners at the sites  or as a result of the insurance industry in general  or other currently unknown factors  g our accruals for fulfillment obligations arising out of promotions proving to be less than the actual redemptions processed in subsequent fiscal periods  or h unpredictable technology changes or commercial technology applications  then  if any one  or a combination  of the above factors were to materialize  we could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period revenue growth and gross margins and  therefore  our profitability  cash flows and capital resources could be materially adversely affected 
bad debt allowances revenue recognition is also subject to provisions based on the probability of collection of the related trade accounts receivable 
we continuously evaluate the potential of the collectibility of trade accounts receivable by reviewing such factors as deterioration in the operating results  financial condition  or bankruptcy filings of our customers 
as a result of this review process  we record bad debt provisions to adjust the related accounts receivable carrying amount to an estimated realizable value 
provisions for bad debts are also recorded due to the review of other factors  including the length of time the accounts receivable are past due  historical experience and other factors obtained during the conduct of collection efforts 
if circumstances change regarding our specific customers on an individual basis  or if demand for internet direct marketing softens  or if the us economy stumbles  our estimates for bad debt provisions could be further increased  which could adversely affect our operating margins  profitability  cash flows and capital resources 
disposition of majority owned subsidiary in march  we sold our interest in our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management llc  for million  plus our investment 
pursuant to the terms of the sale  we received million in cash at closing on march  additionally  we received a note from the purchaser for  payable in monthly installments of  we have also received approximately  representing our gaap basis capital account in such majority subsidiary as at november  we also entered into a two year media purchase agreement whereby we agreed to provide certain media lead generation and related services to the continuing owners of montvale for consideration of  per month over the term of the agreement 
we estimate that the cash flow from the media purchase agreement will equal or exceed the cash flows surrendered pursuant to the disposition of the majority owned subsidiary 
our revenues and profitability from operations have historically varied 
our revenues  cost of providing revenues  profit margins and overhead expenses have varied historically among segments  as well as on a consolidated basis 
the revenue allocation among our segments in future periods will most probably be different than our current revenue allocation due to several factors  including consumer tastes  business opportunities  regulatory issues that may exist in future periods  and other currently unknown factors that could impact our revenue generating cycle or cost structure 
therefore  it is difficult to predict revenue and gross margin trends  and their corresponding impact on liquidity and capital resources 
actual trends may cause us to adjust our operating emphasis  which could result in continued period to period fluctuations in our results of operations 
historically  we have been able to rapidly react to changes in the business environment within which we operate 
management responded to these changes as deemed appropriate at the time of change  and as dictated by the nature of such changes 
management s reaction to such changes covered a broad range of business related adjustments  ranging from product mix repositioning and staff reductions  to entire business model overhauls 
based on our current operations and marketing methods  as well as the dynamic  ever changing status of the internet marketing environment  it is conceivable that we would institute changes to our business practices in response to the potential of unforeseen changes in future fiscal periods 
there can be no assurance that any such potential change in response to the above would be successful in its implementation  and there can be no assurance that any such implementation would benefit our operating margins  profitability  cash flows and capital resources 
impairment of goodwill  other intangibles and investment portfolios could impact net income we carry goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet arising from current and prior year acquisitions 
we are required to review  at least annually  such goodwill and other identifiable intangibles for any asset impairment 
if the review of the goodwill and identifiable intangibles related to the subsidiaries organized to acquire such assets determines that such assets are impaired  then we will be required to recognize an impairment charge on such goodwill necessary to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its net realizable value 
should events occur that would give rise to such impairment charge  we would recognize decreased profitability to the extent of such adjustment 
cash flows would not be directly affected by the impairment charge  but cash flows would  most likely  be adversely affected as a result of the facts and circumstances that created the impairment charge 
market fluctuation and debt repayment risk of marketable securities investment portfolio we maintain an investment portfolio that is managed by prominent financial institutions 
the portfolio includes high grade corporate commercial paper and auction rate securities  certificates of deposit  annuities and common stock equities  all of which are held for varying periods of time  pursuant to maturity dates  market conditions and other factors 
the fair value of our investments in the common stock of publicly traded companies as of november  amounted to approximately million 
these investments are subject to market price volatility  in addition to the potential for business failure at the company level 
moreover  due to the economic downturn  and difficulties that may be faced by some of the companies in which we have investments  our investment portfolio could be further impaired by the failure of such companies to fulfill their responsibility of adhering to the repayment of principal upon maturity 
additionally  interest income  and corresponding cash flows could be negatively impacted by continued federal reserve bank interest rate reductions 
potential of federal  and or state enacted legislation there are a variety of legislative proposals at state and federal levels regarding email marketing 
certain of these proposals  if implemented  could negatively affect our email marketing programs which could cause a material adverse impact in net revenue  gross margins  profitability  cash flows and capital resources
