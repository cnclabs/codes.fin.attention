overview since its founding in  gateway has offered award winning pcs and related products to consumers  businesses  government offices and schools 
with the acquisition of emachines on march   we significantly enhanced our ability to compete and gained greater access to a third party retail distribution network 
we manage our business along our business unit operating segments direct previously consumer  professional  retail and international 
our strengths revolve around our strong name recognition  our technologically advanced product lines  and our ability to maneuver quickly in the rapidly changing pc and consumer electronics industries 
fiscal was a year of significant activity and transition for the company 
some of the key developments and achievements for include acquisition of emachines on march   we completed our million acquisition of emachines  inc  one of the most efficient pc companies in the us  with a significant presence in third party retail 
this acquisition combined gateway s direct and professional businesses  product leadership  brand equity  scale and strong cash position with emachines low cost structure  value pc market strength  third party retail network  and growing international presence 
as of december   gateway was the third largest pc company in the united states and among the top worldwide according to preliminary data from international data corporation 
new management team upon completion of the emachines acquisition  emachines chief executive officer  wayne r 
inouye  became gateway s chief executive officer and president and a new executive leadership team was named that included gateway executives  emachines executives and other industry leaders 
this management team immediately began a comprehensive review of all aspects of the combined company s business  identifying and pursuing opportunities to restructure  reduce costs and expand the business 
change in our distribution model on april   we closed our remaining gateway branded retail stores 
much of the revenue lost through store closures has now been replaced by sales through other channels  in particular sales of gateway branded pcs in third party retail beginning in the second half of expansion into retail and international during the second half of  we successfully introduced gateway desktop and notebook pcs into major retailers in north america 
by years end  in addition to emachines branded pcs  gateway branded pcs were available at retailers such as best buy  compusa  costco  office depot and micro center in the united states as well as future shop and best buy in canada 
in addition  gateway branded pcs were available in circuit city stores beginning in january we also expanded the international distribution of emachines pcs in mexico and gateway pcs in japan 
efforts to simplify our products we reviewed our product lines to strengthen our position in the competitive pc industry and reduced the number of pc platforms utilized across product lines and improved the use of certain common parts 
these actions have and should continue to facilitate component cost reductions and more cost effective after sale customer support 
consolidation of our suppliers we consolidated our supply base  ceased our gateway owned manufacturing operations and transitioned pc manufacturing to key original design manufacturers 
these actions cut desktop pc material costs by an estimated during the second half of we have also consolidated our service and support relationships across the former gateway and emachines service provider network  combining best in class processes and providers from both companies to further drive business efficiencies 
efforts to simplify our processes we simplified and realigned our organization to allow greater focus on front line selling and better sharing of common resources 
we relocated our corporate headquarters from poway  california to irvine  california and  by year end  our integration with emachines was largely complete 
our employee base now stands at approximately  employees compared with approximately  at the time the emachines merger was announced 
introduction of new products during the third quarter we introduced the industry s first btx desktop which optimizes intel s btx architecture with an innovative design that we believe makes our high performance pcs considerably cooler and quieter than other pcs on the market 
other significant new product developments include our new thin and light industrial design laptops  a new lto based tape autoloader storage system to enhance mission critical data backup capacity  an mp photo jukebox and a media center pc designed to take advantage of microsoft s new windows xp media center edition operating system 
repurchase of preferred stock and convertible note offering during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased from america online  inc our outstanding series a and c preferred stock with a par value of million plus million common shares  for million in cash and credits 
this repurchase produced a one time gain to our common shareholders of approximately million 
in connection with this transaction  we secured a million credit facility with a major financial institution and generated approximately million in net cash proceeds through the private placement of senior convertible notes due in and  thereby providing additional capital and operating flexibility for by year end  the q restructuring plan was largely complete 
in addition  the fourth quarter net loss of million was the smallest net loss in quarters 
the shift to a retail distribution model and the increased percentage of retail sales to total sales contributed to an erosion of fourth quarter gross margin from in to in we continue to face a variety of challenges and opportunities inherent within the pc and consumer electronics industries which are characterized by rapid change  evolving customer demands and intense competition 
key challenges include our ability to increase demand for products  our ability to further integrate with the emachines infrastructure and simplify our business  lower costs  manage our manufacturing suppliers  customer service and administrative relationships  anticipate changing customer demands  and maintain and grow pc market share reversing direct channel market share declines in the face of intense competition 
see additional discussion in factors that may affect gateway s business and future results 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses gateway s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and gateway s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires gateway s management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k summarizes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of gateway s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies whose application has a material impact on gateway s financial presentation 
that is  they are both important to the portrayal of gateway s financial condition and results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition gateway recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from training services  previously offered through our store network  was recognized as the services were provided 
revenue from internet services provided by third parties is recognized as the services are provided based on subscriber counts reported to us by the service providers 
if the actual subscriber counts or the economics associated with these subscriber counts prove to be more or less than originally reported by the service providers  we may be required to adjust revenue 
in the fourth quarter of  america online  inc aol unilaterally recomputed payments it had made in and the first half of and withheld the claimed overpayments from amounts currently owed to us 
we disputed aol s retroactive adjustment and reached a settlement in november for million related to the contested period and an additional million for subsequent periods through this was recognized as revenue in revenue from the sale of other services rendered by third parties  such as installation services  is generally recognized when such services are performed 
gateway offers its customers an option to purchase extended warranties 
revenue related to sales of extended warranties sold on behalf of third parties is recognized at the time of sale  net of amounts due to the third party 
revenue from sales of extended warranties where gateway is the legal obligor is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the warranty service period 
gateway records reductions in revenue in the current period for estimated future product returns and estimated rebate redemption rates related to current period sales 
management analyzes historical returns  current trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowances in any accounting period 
management also analyzes historical rebate redemption rates  current trends and the interrelationship of these rates with the current rebate dollar amounts in evaluating rebate allowances 
if actual returns exceed estimated returns or if actual rebate redemptions exceed estimates  we would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
gateway also records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to other customer and sales incentive programs 
this includes  among other things  trade ins and referral credits 
future market conditions and product transitions may require us to increase customer incentive programs that could result in incremental reductions of revenue at the time such programs are offered  which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
allowance for doubtful accounts gateway maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers 
we record an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible 
we also record an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts  the general economic environment  the financial condition of our customers  and the aging of such receivables 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s financial condition or we become aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer  or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated  we may have to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts  which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
best buy accounted for approximately of accounts receivable  net  as of december  and of consolidated net sales for the year ended december  inventory valuation the business environment in which gateway operates is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand 
we record write downs for components and products which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
we perform an assessment of inventory each quarter  which includes a review of  among other factors  inventory on hand and forecast requirements  product life cycle including end of life product and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record an adjustment for excess and obsolete inventory 
gateway may be required to record additional write downs if actual demand  component costs or product life cycles differ from estimates  which would affect earnings in the period the write downs are made 
warranty provision gateway provides standard warranties with the sale of products 
the estimated cost of providing the product warranty is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
we maintain product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of suppliers 
estimated warranty costs are affected by ongoing product failure rates  specific product class failures outside of experience and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure or in providing customer support 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
restructuring gateway has engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require our management to utilize significant estimates related to realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  lease cancellation and other exit costs  and estimates of future rental income that may be generated through the subleasing of excess facilities 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
for a full description of our restructuring actions  refer to our discussion of restructuring charges in the results of operations section 
long lived asset impairments gateway reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
this process requires management to make assumptions and estimates related to estimated future cash flows to be generated and used by an asset or asset group as well as the expected or future use of such assets and or their estimated future useful lives 
actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used and a significant change to the planned use of an asset or asset group could result in a material impairment charge in a given reporting period 
taxes on earnings gateway records a tax provision or benefit for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations 
the provision for benefit from income taxes is computed using the liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider our ability to carryback historical losses  cumulative losses in recent years  forecasted earnings and future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for and amount of a valuation allowance 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized  our valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
gateway expects to maintain a full valuation allowance on potential future tax benefits and generally to record no tax benefit until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained 
litigation gateway is currently involved in certain legal proceedings see note 
when a loss is considered probable in connection with litigation or governmental proceedings and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated within a range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim if there is no best estimate in the range 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to the legal proceedings and revise those estimates 
revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations in the period of adjustment 
non amortized intangible assets including goodwill on march   gateway acquired emachines  a privately held pc company  in a transaction valued at approximately million 
the acquisition combined gateway s professional and consumer now called direct businesses  scale and cash availability with emachines low cost structure  profitability  pc market strength  third party retail network  and international presence 
these factors contributed to a purchase price in excess of the fair value of emachines net tangible and intangible assets acquired and  as a result  gateway recorded goodwill of million 
gateway also recorded million in intangible assets related to the emachines tradename 
these intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicated an event of impairment may exist 
our fourth quarter review process utilizes the income method to estimate fair value based on a discounted future cash flow approach that relies on estimates about gateway s future revenues based on assumed market segment growth rates and costs  discounted at appropriate rates based on gateway s weighted average cost of capital 
future revenue and cost estimates are based on historical data  various internal estimates and a variety of external sources  and are developed as part of our routine long range planning process 
our fourth quarter of assessment supported the conclusion that no non amortized intangible asset  including goodwill  impairment existed as of december  results of operations the following table summarizes gateway s consolidated results of operations and net sales for the past three years in thousands percentage change percentage change net sales gross profit percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of net sales operating loss percentage of net sales net loss units shipped includes million  million and million in   and  respectively  of restructuring  transformation and integration charges 
see the restructuring activities section below for additional information 
net sales vs 
the increases in net sales and pc unit shipments are primarily due to the contribution of emachines pc unit sales subsequent to march  and expansion of the availability of gateway products into third party retail offset by declines in gateway pc sales resulting from the closure of our retail stores on april  the stores previously contributed  on average  approximately million in net sales per quarter 
during the second half of  we greatly expanded the availability of gateway products through third party retail partners and expanded the availability of both gateway and emachines products internationally 
unit sales growth significantly outpaced net sales growth due to the lower average selling price on emachines pcs as compared with gateway pcs  with overall average selling prices declining to in compared to  in our fourth quarter pc market share was approximately as compared with approximately for the fourth quarter  based on preliminary unit sales data from international data corporation 
assuming the acquisition of emachines had occurred on january   pro forma net sales for would have been billion as compared with billion of pro forma net sales in see note to the financial statements 
the decline on a pro forma basis is primarily due to the closure of the gateway retail stores in april partially offset by significant growth in emachines sales in as compared with see segment results below for further discussion of unit and net sales performance on a segment basis 
vs 
net sales declined in to billion as compared with billion in we shipped million pc units in as compared with million pc units in  a decrease of approximately 
the decline in pc unit shipments and net sales primarily resulted from the closure of gateway branded retail stores in the first quarter of  competitive pricing and general market share loss 
our fourth quarter pc market share was approximately as compared with approximately for the fourth quarter of  based on unit sales data from international data corporation 
major product groups the following table summarizes gateway s net sales by major product or service group for the past three years  with certain and amounts recast to conform to presentation in thousands as as as desktops mobiles servers and other total personal computers pc convergence non pc consolidated net revenues on a product basis  net sales of pcs increased in due to the addition of emachines pc unit sales subsequent to march  offset by declines in gateway pc sales due to the closure of the retail stores in april and lower average selling prices  as well as market share losses in the professional segment 
net sales of convergence non pc products declined in due primarily to the closure of our retail stores partially offset by excess convergence non pc product inventory sales associated with the store closures 
to date  gateway has not transitioned sales of convergence non pc products to third party retail to the same extent as its pc products 
convergence non pc offerings include all products and services other than the pc  such as peripherals  software  accessories  extended warranty services  training  internet access  plasma and lcd tvs and digital music players and enterprise system and networking products and services 
in november  gateway entered into an agreement with a third party service plan administrator to sell extended service plans on gateway products on behalf of that administrator and its affiliates 
revenues on extended service plan sales made on behalf of this service provider are recognized net of amounts due to the provider at the time of sale 
gateway previously provided its own extended service plans and revenues on such plans were deferred and recognized over their lives 
convergence non pc net sales increased in as compared with primarily due to considerable market acceptance of gateway s digital television products and the introduction of several consumer electronics products in gross profit vs 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit declined to in as compared with in this significant decline in gross profit is primarily due to the significant shift in sales mix from gateway owned retail stores in to third party retail sales in and lower priced emachines branded pcs  coupled with reduced sales of higher margin convergence non pc products 
third party retail  with margins typically well below direct and professional channel margins  accounted for of total net sales in as compared with approximately in convergence non pc sales accounted for approximately and of gross profit dollars during and  respectively  assuming no allocation for restructuring  transformation and integration charges 
additional factors impacting gross profit include restructuring  transformation and integration charges of million approximately of net sales as compared with million approximately of net sales in  higher rebate redemption rates during the spring and summer of  the effect of excess inventory sales at reduced margins stemming from the closure of our retail stores in april and settlement of a patent infringement claim during the first quarter 
cost of goods sold in includes approximately million paid to one of our third party outsource providers of call center  technical support and related services

restructuring activities we have engaged in several restructuring efforts during the past three years  including actions related to the closure of our gateway branded retail stores  outsourcing of certain processes  workforce reductions and plant closures 
we have also incurred costs in connection with certain transformation efforts and our integration with emachines in see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes restructuring  transformation and other charges recorded by gateway  by income statement classification  for the past three years in thousands restructuring cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative total transformation and other cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative total first quarter plan q plan during the first quarter of  gateway approved a restructuring plan to  among other things  close its remaining retail stores  reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities 
charges of million million in cost of goods sold and million in selling  general and administrative expenses were recorded in relating to these actions 
the significant restructuring actions related to the gateway retail stores were initiated in the first quarter of and substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of all but approximately million of the planned first quarter restructuring  transformation and integration expenses have now been incurred 
in addition to the q plan charges  we incurred million million in cost of goods sold and million in selling  general and administrative expenses in charges associated with previous restructuring activities during we also recorded million million in cost of goods sold and million in selling  general and administrative expenses in in other expenses related to our transformation and integration with emachines  including redundant costs associated with the reintegration of previously outsourced activities 
third quarter of plan q plan during the third quarter of  gateway approved a restructuring plan to  among other things  reduce our workforce and close certain facilities

the significant restructuring activities related to this charge were initiated in the third quarter of and related actions continued through the second quarter of first quarter plan q plan during the first quarter of  gateway approved a restructuring plan to close retail stores in addition to the four stores previously announced 
we also continued our focus on other cost reductions  resulting in a workforce reduction of approximately  employees 
restructuring charges of million million in cost of goods sold and million in selling  general and administrative expenses were recorded during to provide for these actions 
included in the million restructuring charge was million primarily associated with retail stores that were closed during the first quarter of the significant restructuring activities were completed during the first quarter of  however  payments largely representing ongoing store lease obligations are expected to continue through in addition to the charges incurred for the q plan and the q plan  we recorded million million in cost of goods sold and million in selling  general and administrative expenses in charges associated with previous restructuring plans 
we also recorded million million in cost of goods sold and million in selling  general and administrative expenses in related to our transformation into a branded integrator and the outsourcing of certain shared service functions 
first quarter plan q plan during the first quarter of  gateway approved a restructuring plan to  among other things  reduce its workforce and close certain retail locations and other company sites 
a pre tax charge of million million in cost of goods sold and million in selling  general and administrative expenses was recorded to provide for these actions 
included in the pre tax charge of million is million for asset write downs related to the impairment of certain long lived assets that were abandoned during the quarter 
in addition  we recorded an adjustment to reduce previously recorded charges pursuant to the q plan by million during the quarter ended march   primarily due to a higher than expected recovery on assets 
operating loss vs 
operating loss for totaled million compared with million in this reflects restructuring  transformation and other special charges discussed in the restructuring activities section above of million and million in and  respectively 
in addition to these substantial restructuring charges  the operating loss for also reflects gross margin percentage and dollar reductions  primarily due to the greater mix of third party retail sales against a declining but still significant fixed cost base 
the operating loss for resulted from declines in net sales compared to our fixed cost base and significant restructuring charges 
excluding such charges  operating loss declined by million in from the prior year 
the significant improvement in operating loss on this basis reflects the impact of the store closures  head count reductions  it cost rationalization  marketing efficiencies and continued focus on overall sg a cost savings throughout vs 
operating loss for totaled million compared with million in the operating loss in reflects million in restructuring and other special charges discussed above compared with million in the operating losses for and largely resulted from the relatively low pc unit volumes compared to the fixed cost base and restructuring charges 
other income  net other income  net includes primarily interest income and expense and gains and losses from the sale of investments  foreign exchange transactions and extinguishments of liabilities 
other income was million in as compared with million in the slight increase is primarily due to a million gain on the sale of certain extended service liabilities in the fourth quarter of offset by year over year declines in investment income due to the net liquidation of million of marketable securities throughout we expect other income  net to be approximately breakeven for due to the interest and debt issue costs associated with the convertible debt offering completed in other income  net was million in  a decline from million in the decrease in other income  net  for compared to is primarily due to the favorable renegotiation and settlement of a liability associated with our acquisition of a company in and gains on the disposition of certain equity portfolio holdings in  partially offset by write downs of strategic investments in that year 
income taxes in  we recorded a tax benefit of million primarily representing the reversal of previously accrued tax liabilities resulting from certain tax authority settlements 
an additional million deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of emachines was recorded through a charge to goodwill 
this compares to tax expense of million in primarily related to certain state income tax receivables and net deferred tax assets that were deemed not recoverable 
we recorded a million tax benefit in primarily reflecting the impact of losses related to our domestic operations 
segment performance during the second quarter and in connection with the acquisition of emachines  we formed two new operating segments  retail and international  and realigned our historical operating segments  direct previously consumer and professional 
we also realigned the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead expenses to the operating segments 
our segment sales and operations are distinguished as follows direct includes consumer and small business sales generated via gateway s web and phone centers as well as the contribution of gateway retail stores which were closed on april   professional includes sales to customers in education k and higher education  government federal  state and local  medium to large business and third party resellers retail includes sales through third party retail channels  including emachines subsequent to the march  acquisition and gateway products beginning in the third quarter of it also includes activity by gateway alone to certain third party channel customers in and  international includes international sales and is currently aggregated within the retail segment for external reporting purposes as it meets the aggregation criteria of sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
revenues from these segments are derived from sales of pc and convergence non pc products and services 
we evaluate segment performance based on sales and operating income and do not allocate assets  liabilities or other income  net for management reporting purposes 
segment operating income loss includes selling  general and administrative expenses and other overhead charges directly attributable to the segment 
segment operating income loss excludes expenses managed outside the reporting segment  including corporate sales  general and administration expenses  depreciation and amortization and the restructuring  transformation and integration charges discussed in restructuring activities above 
the following table presents key segment performance indicators for the past three years  with and information recast for consistency with current presentation in thousands increase decrease increase decrease units direct professional retail including international total units net sales direct professional retail including international consolidated net revenues operating income loss direct professional retail including international segment operating income loss non segment expenses consolidated operating loss direct direct previously consumer segment unit and net sales declined in as compared with due to the closure of our retail stores in april  slightly offset by store excess inventory sales primarily in the second and third quarters of the stores previously contributed an average of approximately million in net sales per quarter 
direct unit and net sales declines in compared to were driven primarily by the closure of retail stores in the first quarter of and decreases in desktop pc market share 
the decrease in desktop pc market share was partly due to intense price competition in the low end of the market and the gateway strategy prior to the emachines acquisition of offering higher margin  configurable systems which meet our customers needs for more powerful computers with digital convergence capability 
in  third party financial institutions provided financing for approximately of our consumer net sales 
direct segment operating income improved substantially in due primarily to the closure of the retail stores and reduced marketing costs and other selling  general and administrative expenses 
the improvement in direct segment operating results between and is due to the closure of retail stores in  growth in convergence non pc product sales and gross margin dollars  certain cost of goods sold reduction initiatives and sg a expense management  partially offset by declining pc product sales 
professional professional segment unit and net sales declines in are primarily due to market share loss within the government and business sectors due to intense price competition  partially offset by the strong value proposition in the education market which brought market share gains to the professional segment during the key second and third quarter buying season 
the declines in professional segment net sales in were attributable to declines in average selling prices and pc unit shipments reflecting a decrease in pc market share  particularly within the government and education sectors in the and declines in professional segment operating income are primarily the result of declining net sales and margins compared to the segment s fixed cost base 
significant productivity improvement initiatives were implemented during the fourth quarter of which we believe will positively affect future performance 
retail including international the retail segment was created in the second quarter of as a result of the emachines acquisition 
the results reflect the inclusion of emachines sales within this segment subsequent to march   and the growth of these sales in third party retail in  the expansion of gateway branded products into third party retail channels during the second half of  and the expansion of emachines and gateway products internationally 
results for and reflect modest sales of gateway products to third party channel customers 
non segment expenses costs excluded from our operating segments primarily consist of general and administrative expenses that are managed on a corporate wide basis  including restructuring  transformation and integration charges of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
see restructuring activities above 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   gateway had approximately million in cash and marketable securities as compared with  million at the end of approximately million was restricted cash at december   to provide for certain commitments and contingencies including million in standby letters of credit and guarantees 
the following table presents selected financial statistics and information related to cash as of december for the periods indicated dollars in thousands cash and marketable securities net cash provided by used in operations net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities days of sales in accounts receivable a days inventory on hand b days in accounts payable c cash conversion cycle d a days of sales in accounts receivable measures the average number of days receivables are outstanding and is calculated by dividing accounts receivable net of allowances for doubtful accounts by the most recent quarterly net sales 
b days inventory on hand measures the average number of days of inventory from product procurement to sale and is calculated by dividing inventory by the most recent quarterly cost of goods sold 
c days in accounts payable measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding and is calculated by dividing accounts payable by the most recent quarterly cost of goods sold 
d the cash conversion cycle is the sum of days in accounts receivable and inventory on hand less days in accounts payable and effectively measures the number of days from raw material purchase to cash collection on customer sales 
gateway used million in cash in support of operations during  including million of net loss adjusted for non cash items 
other significant factors affecting cash used in operations include a net increase in accounts receivable of million after giving effect for the million in accounts receivable assumed through acquisition of emachines due to the shift in our business model from our former retail stores to third party retail and decreases in current and other liabilities of million including settlement of most of the million in current liabilities assumed in connection with the emachines acquisition  partially offset by declines in inventory and other assets of million after giving effect for the million in inventory and other assets assumed through acquisition of emachines 
from an investing perspective  we generated proceeds of approximately million through the liquidation of marketable securities and the sale of an idled facility and used million in acquisition of emachines  million to settle a shareholder note payable and approximately million in acquisition of capital assets 
from a financing perspective  we generated a net million through a million convertible debt offering  million through borrowings against our credit facility  and million through employee stock option exercises while using million to redeem the series a and c preferred stock held by aol and million to pay preferred stock dividends 
gateway generated million in cash from operating activities in  reflecting a million income tax refund partially offset by million of net loss adjusted for non cash items 
other significant factors affecting cash provided by operations include a net increase in accounts receivable  inventory and other assets of million excluding the million income tax refund offset by a net increase in accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was driven by an increased mix of professional sales 
the increase in inventory was driven by the increased level of products stocked in the retail store network as well as transitional inventory for outsourcing of operational fulfillment processes  while accounts payable increased in connection with new supply and manufacturing agreements 
we used approximately million in cash for capital expenditures and million to purchase marketable securities  offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of million  while generating million in proceeds from a note receivable 
we also used million to pay preferred dividends and generated million through stock option exercises

new accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides new guidelines for the evaluation and determination of whether a loss on certain investments is other than temporary and requires certain additional disclosures pertaining to unrealized investment losses in a company s financial statements 
the effective date of the evaluation and measurement criteria of issue no 
have been delayed pending issuance of additional implementation guidance by the fasb 
the additional disclosure requirements  however  remain effective for annual periods ending after december  and have been included in note to the financial statements 
management continues to monitor the fasb s progress and does not currently expect the adoption of the evaluation and measurement criteria  once issued  to have a material impact on gateway s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in october  the fasb ratified the eitf s consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
this consensus requires that contingently convertible debt instruments  commonly referred to as co cos  be included in diluted earnings per share computations  if dilutive  regardless of whether the contingent feature has been met 
this issue is effective for periods ending after december  in december  gateway repurchased its outstanding series c redeemable convertible preferred stock which contained a contingent conversion feature 
the adoption of this issue did not have a material impact on gateway s consolidated results of operations or financial position given gateway s loss position for  and which would have made inclusion of the series c shares in the number of weighted average shares outstanding antidilutive 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material or spoilage that may be incurred 
among other things  sfas requires that these items be recognized as charges to expense in the periods incurred and clarifies that fixed production overhead costs be allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity 
unallocated overhead costs associated with abnormally low or high production in a given period should be charged to expense in that period 
sfas is effective for gateway on january  and management does not believe adoption of this statement will have a material impact on gateway s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment to replace sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires  among other things  that all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  be measured based on their grant date fair value and recognized as expense in the financial statements effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  unless observable market prices exist  the grant date fair value is estimated using an appropriate option pricing model as determined by management 
management must also make certain assumptions about employee exercise habits  forfeiture rates and select an appropriate amortization methodology for recognizing compensation expense 
the statement requires a modified prospective method of adoption 
under this method  compensation expense will be recorded in the financial statements for all awards granted after july  and the future vesting of awards outstanding as of july  companies may also elect to restate their previously issued financial statements to provide consistency across all periods presented under a modified retrospective method 
management believes the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on gateway s consolidated results of operations and earnings per share but has not yet determined the method of adoption that will be applied or whether adoption will result in expense amounts materially different from those currently provided under the pro forma disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements

regarding long term investments  gateway holds and may continue to consider investments in minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within gateway s strategic focus 
adverse changes in market conditions such as occurred in the years starting in  and poor operating results of certain of these underlying investments  have resulted and may in the future result in gateway incurring losses or an inability to recover the original carrying value of our investments

management does not expect such fluctuations would materially adversely affect gateway s future results of operations 
as of march   we had repaid million and currently anticipate repaying the remaining amount during
