the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used by the company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
valuation of property held for use and sale on a quarterly basis  the company reviews the carrying value of both properties held for use and for sale 
the company records impairment losses and reduces the carrying value of properties when indicators of impairment are present and the expected undiscounted cash flows related to those properties are less than their carrying amounts 
in cases where the company does not expect to recover its carrying costs on properties held for use  the company reduces its carrying cost to fair value  and for properties held for sale  the company reduces its carrying value to the fair value less costs to sell 
for the year ended december   an impairment loss of million was recognized related to properties which were held for sale and subsequently sold 
management does not believe that the value of any properties in its portfolio was impaired as of december  or bad debts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make payments on arrearages in billed rents  as well as the likelihood that tenants will not have the ability to make payment on unbilled rents including estimated expense recoveries and straight line rent 
as of december   the company had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of the company s tenants were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inflation the company s long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on the company s net income 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indexes 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents upon re rental at market rates if current rents are below the then existing market rates 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates related to the company s mortgage debt 
see the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k for certain quantitative details related to the company s mortgage debt 
currently  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through the use of fixed rate debt and interest rate swap agreements as of december   the company had total mortgage debt of million of which million  or was fixed rate  inclusive of interest rate swaps  and million  or  was variable rate based upon libor plus certain spreads 
as of december   the company was a party to five interest rate swap transactions to hedge the company s exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million of libor based variable rate debt 
the company also has four forward starting interest rate swaps which commence during  and and mature from to that will hedge the company s exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million of refinanced libor based variable rate debt with the matching maturities 
the following table sets forth information as of december  concerning the company s long term debt obligations  including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity and weighted average interest rates of maturing amounts amounts in millions consolidated mortgage debt year scheduled amortization maturities total weighted average interest rate n a n a n a thereafter mortgage debt in unconsolidated partnerships at company s pro rata share year scheduled amortization maturities total weighted average interest rate n a n a thereafter of the company s total outstanding debt  million will become due in as the company intends on refinancing some or all of such debt at the then existing market interest rates which may be greater than the current interest rate  the company s interest expense would increase by approximately million annually if the interest rate on the refinanced debt increased by basis points 
interest expense on the company s variable debt as of december  would not increase materially as the company has only million of floating rate debt after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps hedging million of notional principal 
the company may seek additional variable rate financing if and when pricing and other commercial and financial terms warrant 
as such  the company would consider hedging against the interest rate risk related to such additional variable rate debt through interest rate swaps and protection agreements  or other means
