item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the company reported income from continuing operations of million  or 
per diluted share  in compared to income of million  or 
per diluted share  in and million  or 
per diluted share  in as more fully described below  the company s diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from to due primarily to the net effects of i higher sales in  ii improved margins in through cost reduction efforts  iii lower interest expense in and iv a higher effective income tax rate in the company s diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from to due primarily to the net effects of i higher sales in  ii improved margins in through cost reduction efforts  iii lower interest expense in and iv a higher effective income tax rate in fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not significantly affect the company s results in as compared to fluctuations in currency exchange rates in as compared to positively impacted sales by million but negatively impacted cost of goods sold by million and operating profit by million 
the impact on net sales is primarily due to the weakening us dollar in relation to the canadian dollar 
the impact on operating income is primarily from the company s canadian operations  where the majority of net sales are denominated in us dollars while the majority of expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 
cash provided by operating activities improved to million in from million in improvement in income from continuing operations was a significant contributor to the improvement in cash flow 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets and the realization of deferred income tax assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical financial statement judgment risks of its business are attributable to four primary areas o will customer accounts receivable on the books be collected at full book value o will inventory on hand be sold with a sufficient mark up to cover the cost to produce and ship the product o will future cash flows of the company be sufficient to recover the net book value of long lived assets o will future taxable income be sufficient to utilize recorded deferred income tax assets the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates  as noted above  used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and are applicable to all of the company s operating segments o allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of the customers  the age of outstanding balances and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowances 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  increased allowances may be required 
o inventory reserves 
the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
the company also considers the age and the quantity of inventory on hand in estimating the reserve 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  increased inventory reserves may be required 
o net book value of long lived assets 
the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  whenever it determines that recovery of the long lived asset is not probable 
the determination is made in accordance with applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
goodwill will also be reviewed for impairment at other times during each year when impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
based on the company s latest annual impairment review of goodwill of the reporting units during the third quarter of  no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist 
based on this review  the estimated fair value of the security products reporting units exceeded the net carrying value by  compx waterloo by  and thomas regout by 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair values of these three reporting units are determined based on discounted cash flow projections 
significant judgment is required in estimating such cash flows 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that such operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
in december  the company s thomas regout operations met the criteria under gaap to be classified as held for sale and thus was required to be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell 
at such time  the company recognized a million impairment of the goodwill related to such operations  as the carrying amount of the net assets exceed the estimated fair value less cost to sell of the operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  property and equipment is not assessed for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  no impairment indicators were present with respect to the company s property and equipment 
o deferred income tax assets 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realizable under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized 
this would result in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in estimate is made 
results of operations the company s operating segments are defined as components of its operations about which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker in determining how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the company currently has three operating segments security products  precision slide and ergonomics 
the security products segment  with manufacturing facilities in south carolina and illinois  manufactures locking mechanisms and other security products for sale to the office furniture  banking  vending  computer and other industries 
the precision slide segment  with facilities in canada  michigan and taiwan  manufactures and distributes a complete line of precision ball bearing slides for use in office furniture  computer related equipment  tool storage cabinets and other applications 
the ergonomics segment manufactures and distributes ergonomic computer support systems for office furniture from a facility in canada that it shares with the precision slide segment 
previously  the company has aggregated the precision slide and ergonomics operating segments into a single reportable segment  compx waterloo  because of the integrated facility used by the two businesses and the similar economic characteristics  customer types  production processes  and distribution methods 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began to measure the ergonomics business as a separate operating unit and develop appropriate allocations relating to certain shared expenses in order to disaggregate the operating results 
prior to  disaggregated information is not available due to the impracticality of allocating certain historical expenses that are shared between the two segments 
therefore  aggregated segment amounts are reported for precision slides ergonomics in current and previous periods as well as the disaggregated information for net sales and operating income years ended december  in millions net operating operating sales income income margin precision slides security products ergonomics total years ended december  change in millions net sales precision slides ergonomics security products total net sales operating income loss precision slides nm nm ergonomics security products total operating income operating income loss margin precision slides ergonomics security products total operating income margin nm not meaningful year ended december  compared to year ended december  currency 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the non us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations principally in canada are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect the precision slides and ergonomics segments  and do not materially affect the security products segment 
during  currency exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted the company s sales comparisons with  and negatively impacted the company s operating income comparisons for the same periods 
net sales were positively impacted while operating income was negatively impacted by currency exchange rates in the following amounts by segment as compared to the currency exchange rates in effect during precision security slides products ergonomics total impact on net sales   impact on operating income net sales 
net sales increased million  or  in compared to principally due to increases in product prices for precision slides and ergonomic products  which were primarily a pass through of steel cost increases to customers 
additionally  currency exchange rates favorably impacted sales within the precision slides and ergonomic product segments 
net sales of slide products in increased as compared to  while net sales of security products decreased less than and net sales of ergonomic products increased as compared to the same period 
the percentage changes in slide and ergonomic products include the impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales of security products are generally denominated in us dollars 
costs of goods sold 
the company s cost of goods sold was flat in compared to  although net sales increased during the same period 
the resulting improvement in gross margin was due to the full year impact of cost improvement initiatives completed during partially offset by the negative impact of the aforementioned changes in currency exchange rates and increases in the cost of steel  the primary raw material for the company s products 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries  commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense increased slightly from of net sales in to in a significant portion of the increase was due to costs relating to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of operating income 
operating income for increased million  or compared to and operating margins increased to in compared to for continued reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and other overhead costs were partially offset by the effects of the changes in currency exchange rates and increases in certain raw material costs primarily steel 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  currency 
during  currency exchange rate fluctuations of the canadian dollar positively impacted the company s sales comparisons with principally with respect to slide products  and negatively impacted the company s operating income comparisons 
net sales were positively impacted while operating income was negatively impacted by currency exchange rates in the following amounts as compared to precision slides security ergonomics products total impact on net sales   impact on operating income   net sales 
net sales increased million  or  in compared to principally due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar  combined with a strong fourth quarter for security products 
in addition to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  net sales increased in as compared to due to higher sales volumes of security products  and precision slide products in north america partially offset by lower sales volumes of ergonomic products 
net sales of slide products in increased as compared to  while net sales of security products increased and net sales of ergonomic products decreased during the same period 
the percentage changes in slide and ergonomic products include the impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales of security products are generally denominated in us dollars 
costs of goods sold 
the company s cost of goods sold increased in compared to  which was a lower rate of increase than the increase in net sales during the same period 
cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales was lower than as cost improvement initiatives  such as improving facility efficiency  were partially offset by expenses to consolidate the two kitchener  ontario plants into a single facility during  the negative impact of the aforementioned changes in currency exchange rates and increases in the cost of steel  the primary raw material for the company s products 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense declined slightly from of net sales in to in charges 
the company recorded a pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of of million  the majority of which was non cash in nature 
the fourth quarter charge relates to a retooling of the company s precision slide manufacturing facility in byron center  michigan and includes a million loss on disposal of equipment  reflected in other general corporate income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
the remainder of the charge is reflected in cost of goods sold 
an additional fourth quarter pre tax charge of approximately million was recorded to cost of goods sold to adjust for various changes in estimates with respect to obsolete and slow moving inventory  inventory overhead absorption rates and other items 
approximately million of this charge related to the compx precision slides ergonomics segment with the remaining 
million relating to the compx security products segment 
operating income 
operating income for increased million  or compared to and operating margins improved to in compared to for continued reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and other overhead costs combined with the impact of the fourth quarter charge partially offset the effects of the changes in currency exchange rates  changes in product mix  and increases in certain raw material costs primarily steel 
general the company s profitability primarily depends on its ability to utilize its production capacity effectively  which is affected by  among other things  the demand for its products and its ability to control its manufacturing costs  primarily comprised of labor costs and raw materials such as zinc  copper  coiled steel and plastic resins 
raw material costs represent approximately of the company s total cost of sales 
during  and  worldwide steel prices increased significantly 
the company occasionally enters into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not commit the company to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows the company to stabilize raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
the company enters into such arrangements for zinc  coiled steel and plastic resins and anticipates further significant changes in the cost of these materials  primarily coiled steel  from their current levels for the next year 
materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
due to the competitive nature of the markets served by the company s products  it is often difficult to recover such increases in raw material costs through increased product selling prices 
consequently  overall operating margins may be affected by such raw material cost pressures 
other general corporate income expense  net as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements  other general corporate income expense  net primarily includes interest income  losses on disposal of property and equipment and net foreign currency transaction gain and loss 
in  loss on disposal of property and equipment included approximately million related to the retooling of the company s precision slide manufacturing facility in byron center  michigan 
the remainder of the pre tax charge  
million  is reflected in cost of goods sold and related to the cost of moving and installing machinery and equipment as well as the disposal of obsolete inventory 
interest expense interest expense declined 
million in compared to and declined 
million in compared to due primarily to lower average levels of borrowing on compx s revolving bank credit facility  partially offset by higher interest rates 
interest expense in is expected to be lower compared to due to the reduction in the outstanding indebtedness 
provision for income taxes the principal reasons for the difference between compx s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax rates vary by jurisdiction country and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of compx s pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the effective income tax rate 
net loss in was negatively impacted by an increase in the effective income tax rate primarily as a result of an increased proportion of foreign sourced dividend income taxed at a higher effective tax rate 
the company expects to generate a million tax benefit associated with the us capital loss expected to be realized in the first quarter of upon the completion of the sale of the thomas regout operations 
however  the company has determined that realization of such benefits does not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria and therefore  the deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance at december  the deferred income tax benefit and the offsetting valuation allowance are both reflected as a component of discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions compx is a party to certain transactions with related parties 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting principles not yet adopted see note to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook while demand has stabilized across most product segments  certain customers are seeking lower cost asian sources as alternatives to the company s products 
compx believes the impact of this will be mitigated through ongoing initiatives to expand both new products and new market opportunities 
asian sourced competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue to be a challenge as asian manufacturers  particularly those located in china  gain market share 
the company s strategy in responding to the competitive pricing pressure has included reducing production cost through product reengineering  improvement in manufacturing processes or moving production to lower cost facilities  including our own asian based manufacturing facilities 
the company also has emphasized and focused on opportunities where it can provide value added customer support services that asian based manufacturers are generally unable to provide 
the combination of the company s cost control initiatives together with its value added approach to development and marketing of products are believed to help mitigate the impact of competitive pricing pressures 
additionally  the company s cost for steel continues to rise dramatically due to the continued high demand and shortages worldwide 
while the company has thus far been able to pass a majority of its higher raw material costs on to its customers through price increases and surcharges  there is no assurance that the company would be able to continue to pass along any additional higher costs to its customers 
the price increases and surcharges may accelerate the efforts of some of the company s customers to find less expensive products from foreign manufacturers 
the company will continue to focus on cost improvement initiatives  utilizing lean manufacturing techniques and prudent balance sheet management in order to minimize the impact of lower sales  particularly to the office furniture industry  and to develop value added customer relationships with an additional focus on sales of the company s higher margin ergonomic computer support systems to improve operating results 
these actions  along with other activities to eliminate excess capacity  are designed to position the company to expand more effectively on both new product and new market opportunities to improve company profitability 
liquidity and capital resources summary 
the company s primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is its cash flow from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term or long term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital or capital expenditure purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends if declared 
from time to time  the company will incur indebtedness  primarily for short term working capital needs  or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
in addition  from time to time  the company may also sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to repay indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
at december   the company had no amounts outstanding under its credit agreement  which expires in january cash provided by operating activities improved to million in from million in the improvement in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the improvement in operating results 
consolidated cash flows operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  for  and have generally been similar to the trend in the company s earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared to due to lower capital expenditures during and as the company reduced is production capacity  but increased in compared to due to an increase in the amount of assets put into service during and relating to specific customer volumes combined with the impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
see notes and changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time 
however  year to year relative changes in assets and liabilities can significantly affect the comparability of cash flows from operating activities 
in  the declines in accounts receivable and accounts payable are the result of the lower sales volumes  but the inventory decrease is relatively more significant as the company began to realize some of the benefit of its lean manufacturing initiatives 
for  the increase in sales volumes resulted in higher accounts receivable and accounts payable balances while the company continued to actively reduce inventory levels 
in  the lower accounts receivable was the result of higher than normal payments received during december due to focused collection efforts  the decrease in accrued liabilities was the result of payments relating to the thomas regout restructuring accrual and the positive cash flow from income taxes relating to the timing of refunds received during and an increase in accrued income taxes resulting from the improvement in taxable income 
investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures in the past three years emphasized manufacturing equipment which utilize new technologies and increases automation of the manufacturing process to provide for increased productivity and efficiency 
capital expenditures in through relate primarily to general equipment upgrades  modernization  and capacity increases relating to specific customer volumes 
in june  the company received approximately million from the sale of its surplus trillium facility in ontario  canada  which approximated the net carrying value of the facility 
capital expenditures for are estimated at approximately million  the majority of which relates to projects that emphasize improved production efficiency including replacement of equipment that is being retired 
firm purchase commitments for capital projects in process at december  approximated million 
financing activities 
net cash used by financing activities totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
total cash dividends paid in was million 
per share and in each of and were million 
per share 
the company suspended its regular quarterly dividend in the second quarter of and reinstated the regular quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of the company repaid a net million  million and million under its revolving bank credit facility during  and  respectively 
the company s million secured revolving bank credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company s united states assets and at least of the ownership interests in the company s first tier non united states subsidiaries 
provisions contained in the revolving bank credit agreement could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  the company s credit agreement allows the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of the credit agreement could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business  which provision was waived in conjunction with the company s sale of its thomas regout operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other than certain operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither compx nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other on january   compx completed the disposition of all of the net assets of its thomas regout precision slide and window furnishing operations  conducted at its facility in the netherlands  to members of thomas regout management for net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds consisted of cash net of costs to sell of approximately million and a subordinated note for approximately million 
the subordinated note requires annual payments over a period of four years 
historically  the thomas regout european operations have not contributed significantly to net cash flows from operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under the credit agreement  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service 
to the extent that the company s actual operating results or other developments differ from the company s expectations  compx s liquidity could be adversely affected 
the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  its capital expenditure requirements  dividend policy and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of its common stock  modify its dividend policy or take a combination of such steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  the company may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  the company may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of the company or its subsidiaries 
contractual obligations 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company is obligated to make future payments under certain debt and lease agreements  and is a party to other commitments 
the following table summarizes these obligations as of december  payments due by period less than total year years years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations and other operating leases  purchase obligations   income taxes   fixed asset acquisitions   total contractual cash obligations   the purchase obligations consist of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations  primarily commitments to purchase raw materials 
fixed asset acquisitions include firm purchase commitments for capital projects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company periodically uses currency forward contracts to manage a portion of foreign exchange rate risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency 
otherwise  the company does not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor does the company enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than the contracts discussed below  the company was not a party to any forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates or interest rates at december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december   the company had no amounts outstanding under its secured revolving bank credit agreement 
at december   substantially all of the company s outstanding indebtedness was variable rate borrowings 
such borrowings at december  related principally to million in borrowings under the company s secured revolving bank credit agreement 
the outstanding balances at december  which approximate fair value had a weighted average interest rate of 
the credit facility expires in january and any amounts outstanding would be due at that time 
the remaining indebtedness outstanding at december  and is not material 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products outside the united states principally canada and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations principally in canada are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
as already mentioned certain of compx s sales generated by its canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
to manage a portion of the foreign exchange rate market risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  at december  compx held a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through march to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of canadian dollars at exchange rates of cdn 
to cdn 
per us dollar 
at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
at each balance sheet date  outstanding currency forward contracts are marked to market with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently unless the contract is designated as a hedge upon which the mark to market adjustment is recorded in other comprehensive income 
at december  compx had entered into a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through february to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of canadian dollars at exchange rates of cdn 
to cdn 
per us dollar 
at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
the estimated fair value of such contracts is not material at december  and other 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events or losses 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties some of which are listed in business general
