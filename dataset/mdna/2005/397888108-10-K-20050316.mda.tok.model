item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
overview we are a leading provider of contract land drilling services in the united states with a fleet  at march   of rigs  of which rigs were marketed 
our customers include independent producers and major oil and natural gas companies 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries in the ark la tex  gulf coast  mississippi alabama  south texas  west texas and rocky mountain drilling markets 
our drilling contracts generally provide compensation on a daywork  turnkey or footage basis see item business contracts 
our business is cyclical and our financial results depend upon several factors 
these factors include the overall demand for land drilling services  the level of demand for turnkey and footage services  the demand for deep versus shallow drilling services  the dayrates we receive for our services and our success drilling turnkey and footage wells 
rig activity the united states land rig count at march  reached  rigs  which is higher than the levels reached during the up cycle 
as a result of this increased demand  we have also seen an increase in our average rigs worked throughout our average working rig count rose approximately from the first quarter of to march   including the ten rigs that we added to our fleet in connection with the acquisition of new patriot drilling corp 
patriot 
for the week ended march   we had an average of rigs working 
the table below shows the average number of land rigs working in the united states according to the baker hughes rotary rig count and the average number of our rigs working 
domestic land rig full full to count q q q q year q q q q year baker hughes grey wolf we are signing an increasing number of term contracts 
we currently have rigs working under term contracts with terms of six months to two years 
these rigs are included in the average rigs working in the table above 
in addition  nine more rigs are scheduled to go to work under term contracts by mid second quarter and we have a total of approximately  and  days contracted for and  respectively  under term contracts 
drilling contract bid rates improvements in the level of land drilling in the united states during have positively impacted the dayrates we are receiving for our rigs 
our dayrates rose an average of  per day across rigs and all our market regions in the fourth quarter of over the third quarter 
this compares to an increase of per day between the second and third quarters of this latest quarter to quarter increase is the largest we have experienced since the second quarter of as of march   our bid rates have risen to between  to  per rig day  without fuel or top drives 
we expect this upward trend in dayrates to continue during  however  we cannot predict the rate of increase 
in addition to our fleet of drilling rigs  we owned top drives at march   for which our bid rates are up to  per day  at that date 
bid rates for our top drives are in addition to the above stated bid rates for our rigs 

table of contents turnkey and footage contract activity turnkey and footage work is an important part of our business and operating strategy 
our engineering and operating expertise allow us to provide this service to our customers and has historically provided higher revenues and earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda per rig day worked than under daywork contracts 
a rig day is defined as a twenty four hour period in which a rig is under contract and should be earning revenue 
however  we are typically required to bear additional operating costs such as drill bits and risk such as loss of hole that would otherwise be assumed by the customer under daywork contracts 
in  our turnkey and footage ebitda per rig day was  compared to a daywork ebitda per rig day of  and our turnkey and footage revenue was  per rig day compared to  per rig day for daywork 
for the year ended december   turnkey and footage work represented of total rig days worked compared to of total rig days worked in this percentage decrease in is due to the increase in the number of days worked under daywork contracts 
ebitda generated on turnkey and footage contracts can vary widely based upon a number of factors  including the location of the contracted work as well as the depth and level of complexity of the wells drilled 
the demand for drilling services under turnkey and footage contracts has historically been lower during periods of overall higher demand 
we have not  however  experienced this typical market reaction thus far in this most recent increase in demand 
while overall demand has been higher as evidenced by the increase in rig count  the demand for our turnkey services has not significantly declined 
first quarter outlook we have prepared an estimate of results for the first quarter of based upon currently anticipated levels of drilling activity and dayrates 
we expect that for the first quarter we will have an average of rigs working per day  ebitda of approximately million and net income per share of approximately on a diluted basis  projecting an annual tax rate of approximately 
we expect depreciation expense of approximately million and interest expense of approximately million in the first quarter of capital expenditures for the full year are currently projected to be million to million subject to the actual level of rig activity and the ultimate number of rig reactivations during the year 
these projections are forward looking statements and while we believe our estimates are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations or the assumptions that underlie such assumptions will prove to be correct 
we expect to average between seven and nine rigs working under turnkey and footage contracts during the first quarter of  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the current level of activity or the financial results we have historically derived from turnkey and footage contracts 
see item business forward looking statements for important factors that could cause actual results to be different materially from our expectations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements require our management to make subjective estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
however  these estimates  judgments and assumptions concern matters that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the accounting policies that we believe are critical are property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  revenue recognition  insurance accruals  and income taxes 
property and equipment 
property and equipment  including betterments and improvements are stated at cost with depreciation calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we make estimates with respect to the useful lives that we believe are reasonable 
however  the cyclical nature of our business or the introduction of new technology in the industry  could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation 
when any asset is tested for recoverability  we also review the remaining useful life of the asset 
any changes to the estimated useful life resulting from that review are made prospectively 
we expense our maintenance and repair costs as incurred 
we estimate the useful lives of our assets are between three and fifteen years 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of our long lived assets under statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such indicators include changes in our business plans  a change in the physical condition of a long lived asset or the extent or manner in which it is being used  or a severe or sustained downturn in the oil and natural gas industry 
if we determine that a triggering event  such as those described previously  has occurred we perform a review of our rig and rig equipment 
our review is performed by comparing the carrying value of each rig plus the estimated cost to refurbish or reactivate to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for that rig 
if the carrying value plus estimated refurbishment and reactivation cost of any rig is more than the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the rig  a write down of the rig to estimated fair market value must be made 
the estimated fair market value is the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best estimate of fair market value  however  quoted market prices are generally not available 
as a result  fair value must be determined based upon other valuation techniques 
this could include appraisals or present value calculations 
the calculation of undiscounted future net cash flows and fair market value is based on our estimates and projections 
the demand for land drilling services is cyclical and has historically resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization 
the severity and duration of the downturn during triggered an asset impairment charge of million 
we believe the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will fluctuate 
the likelihood of an asset impairment increases during extended periods of rig inactivity 
each year we evaluate our cold stacked and inventory rigs and determine our intentions for their future use 
this evaluation takes into consideration  among other things  the physical condition and marketability of the rig  and projected reactivation or refurbishment cost 
to the extent that our estimates of refurbishment and reactivation cost  undiscounted future net cash flows or fair market value change or there is a deterioration in the physical condition of the inventory or cold stacked rigs  we could be required under sfas no 
to record an impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax  non cash asset impairment charge of million after performing such a review 
due to the deterioration of the physical condition of five of the inventory rigs and changes in market conditions  it was determined that the rigs  based upon the economics  could no longer be returned to service at a reasonable cost that would have provided an acceptable return and that the usable component parts would be included in spare equipment and depreciated over five years 
in and  no impairment of our long lived assets was recorded as no change in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of the assets was not recoverable 
below is summary of our rig fleet and the estimated cost to refurbish and reactivate  excluding drill pipe  by category as of march  estimated per rig refurbishment and reactivation number cost rig category of rigs excluding drill pipe marketed n a cold stacked million inventory million the net book value of the inventory rigs at december  was million 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the second quarter of  we completed the acquisition of patriot  which was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
in conjunction with the purchase price allocation of the patriot acquisition we recorded goodwill of million and intangible assets of million 
the intangible assets represent customer contracts and related relationships acquired and are being amortized over the useful life of three years 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of the business acquired 
none of the goodwill resulting from this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to 
table of contents their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
revenue recognition 
revenues are earned under daywork  turnkey and footage contracts 
revenue from daywork and footage contracts is recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
on daywork contracts  revenue is recognized based on the number of days completed at fixed rates stipulated by the contract 
on footage contracts  revenue is recognized based on the number of feet that have been drilled at fixed rates stipulated by the contract 
revenue from turnkey drilling contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon costs incurred to date compared to our estimate of the total contract costs 
under percentage of completion  we make estimates of the total contract costs to be incurred  and to the extent these estimates change  the amount of revenue recognized could be affected 
the significance of the accrued turnkey revenue varies from period to period depending on the overall level of demand for our services and the portion of that demand that is for turnkey services 
at december   there were five turnkey wells in progress versus eight wells at december   with accrued revenue of million and million  respectively at such dates 
anticipated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are recorded at the time our estimated costs exceed the contract revenue 
all turnkey wells in progress at december  have been completed and we did not incur any additional losses 
insurance accruals 
we maintain insurance coverage related to workers compensation and general liability claims up to million per occurrence with an aggregate of million for general liability claims 
these policies include deductibles of  per occurrence for workers compensation coverage and  per occurrence for general liability coverage 
if losses should exceed the workers compensation and general liability policy amounts  we have excess liability coverage up to a maximum of million 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  accrued for losses incurred within the deductible amounts for workers compensation and general liability claims and for uninsured claims 
the amount accrued for the provision for losses incurred varies depending on the number and nature of the claims outstanding at the balance sheet dates 
in addition  the accrual includes management s estimate of the future cost to settle each claim such as future changes in the severity of the claim and increases in medical costs 
we use third parties to assist us in developing our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle each claim  which is based upon historical experience associated with the type of each claim and specific information related to each claim 
the specific circumstances of each claim may change over time prior to settlement and as a result  our estimates made as of the balance sheet dates may change 
income taxes 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards nol s 
the estimated amount of our nol s at december  are million  which expires from to approximately million of these nol s expire in and  while the remaining million expire between and deferred tax assets must be assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
at december   we do not have a valuation allowance as we believe that it is more likely than not that our future taxable income and reversal of deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to recover our deferred tax assets 
our business  however  is extremely cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in oil and natural gas prices and demand for our services and there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments will not impact our ability to recover our deferred tax assets 
in addition  we have million in permanent differences which relate to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of assets that were purchased in capital stock acquisitions 
the permanent difference will be reduced as the assets are depreciated for financial accounting purposes on a straight line basis over the next eight years 
as the amortization of these permanent differences is a fixed amount  our effective tax rate varies widely based upon the current level of income or loss 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our statutory to effective tax rate 

table of contents financial condition and liquidity the following table summarizes our financial position as of december  and december  december  december  in thousands amount amount working capital property and equipment  net goodwill other noncurrent assets total long term debt other long term liabilities shareholders equity total significant changes in financial condition the acquisition of patriot and the refinancing of our remaining notes significantly impacted our balance sheet in these changes included increases in net property and equipment  goodwill  other noncurrent assets  deferred income taxes and shareholders equity 
on april   we acquired all the outstanding capital stock and stock equivalents of patriot by merger in exchange for million in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at million 
in addition  we made payments of million to retire the outstanding debt of patriot 
patriot had a fleet of ten drilling rigs and provided onshore contract land drilling services to the oil and natural gas industry in the rocky mountain region 
the fair value of the property and equipment acquired was million while intangible assets acquired were valued at million 
the intangible assets represent customer contracts and related customer relationships acquired and are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
the intangible assets are included in other noncurrent assets in the table above 
we also recorded goodwill of million as a result of the acquisition 
net property and equipment was also affected by capital expenditures other than for patriot of million and depreciation for of million 
in conjunction with the patriot acquisition  we recorded additional deferred tax liabilities valued at million 
this amount is included in other long term liabilities in the table above 
on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of floating rate contingent convertible senior notes due the floating rate notes in a private offering which yielded net proceeds of million 
of the net proceeds  million was irrevocably deposited with the trustee of the notes to redeem the outstanding million aggregate principal amount of those notes at  plus accrued interest on april  the redemption premium of million on the notes was included in interest expense for the year ended december  in addition  on april   one of the initial purchasers in our private offering of the floating rate notes exercised its full option to purchase an additional million aggregate principal amount of the floating rate notes 
as a result  we have million aggregate principal amount of the floating rate notes outstanding 
the additional floating rate notes have the same terms as those issued on march  and we will use  or have used  the net proceeds of approximately million for general corporate purposes 
the issuance of the floating rate notes and redemption of the notes resulted in an increase in long term debt of million 
working capital increased by million from december  to december   due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable and cash balances partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances 
these balances have increased because of the increase in rig activity 
shareholders equity also increased due to the exercise of stock options  which yielded proceeds of million and increased due to net income

cit facility our subsidiary grey wolf drilling company lp amended its credit facility in december  with the cit group business credit  inc the cit facility and extended the maturity of the credit facility until december  the cit facility was also increased from million to million 
it also provides us with the ability to borrow up to the lesser of million or of the orderly liquidation value as defined in the agreement of certain drilling rig equipment located in the contiguous states of the united states of america 
the cit facility provides that up to million of the million is available for letters of credit 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the amount available for borrowing under the cit facility 
the cit facility is a revolving facility with automatic renewals after expiration unless terminated by the lender on any subsequent anniversary date and then only upon days prior notice 
periodic interest payments are due at a floating rate based upon our debt service coverage ratio within a range of either libor plus to or prime plus to 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the cit facility and letters of credit accrue a fee of per annum 
the cit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and we are in compliance with these covenants 
substantially all of our assets  including our drilling equipment  are pledged as collateral under the cit facility which is also secured by a guarantee of grey wolf  inc and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries guarantees 
however  we retain the option  subject to a minimum appraisal value  under the cit facility to extract million of the equipment out of the collateral pool in connection with the sale or exchange of such collateral or relocation of equipment outside the contiguous states of the united states of america 
we currently have no outstanding balance under the cit facility but had million of undrawn letters of credit at march  these standby letters of credit are for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for premiums and retained losses which may become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts and for other purposes 

table of contents among the various covenants that we must satisfy under the cit facility are the following two covenants  as defined in the cit facility  which apply whenever our liquidity  defined as the sum of cash  cash equivalents and availability under the cit facility  falls below million 
at december   our liquidity as defined above was million 
to ebitda coverage of debt service  tested monthly on a trailing month basis  and minimum tangible net worth at the end of each quarter will be at least the prior year tangible net worth less non cash write downs since the prior year end less fixed amounts for each quarter end for which the test is calculated 
additionally  if the total amount outstanding under the cit facility including outstanding letters of credit exceeds of the orderly liquidation value of our domestic rigs  we are required to make a prepayment in the amount of the excess 
also  if the average rig utilization rate falls below for two consecutive months  the lender will have the option to request one additional appraisal per year to aid in determining the current orderly liquidation value of the drilling equipment 
average rig utilization is defined as the total number of rigs owned which are operating under drilling contracts in the contiguous states of the united states of america divided by the total number of rigs owned  excluding rigs not capable of working without substantial capital investment 
events of default under the cit facility include  in addition to non payment of amounts due  misrepresentations and breach of loan covenants and certain other events including default with respect to other indebtedness in excess of  legal judgments in excess of  or a change in control which means that we cease to own of our two principal subsidiaries  some person or group has either acquired beneficial ownership of or more of the outstanding common stock of grey wolf  inc or obtained the power to elect a majority of our board of directors  or our board of directors ceases to consist of a majority of continuing directors as defined by the cit facility 
cash flow the net cash provided by or used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized below amounts in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash our cash flows from operating activities are affected by a number of factors including the number of rigs working under contract  whether the contracts are daywork  footage or turnkey  and the rate received for these services 
our cash flow generated from operating activities during the year ended december  was million compared to cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  of million 
this increase in cash flow from operating activities from to is due primarily to an increase in ebitda as a result of higher dayrates and rig activity 
our cash flow used in operating activities during the year ended december  was million compared to cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december  of million 
this decrease in cash flow from operating activities from to was principally due to a decrease in ebitda per rig day between the two periods 
this decline was due in large part to the replacement of expiring term contracts with spot market contracts at lower rates 
cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended december  primarily consisted of million of cash paid in the patriot acquisition and million of capital expenditures 
for the years ended december  and  cash flow used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of 
table of contents million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures included betterments and improvements to our rigs  the acquisition of drill pipe and drill collars  the purchase of top drives  and other capital items 
also included in capital expenditures in was the cash purchase of two diesel electric scr rigs for million 
cash flow provided by financing activities for primarily consisted of the net proceeds of million from the issuance of million of floating rate notes on march  and april   offset by million for the redemption of the notes on april  in addition  proceeds from stock option exercises provided million in cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended december consisted of the million partial redemption of the and the sale of the notes  which yielded net proceeds of million

if letters of credit which we cause to be issued are drawn upon by the holders of those letters of credit  then we will become obligated to repay those amounts along with any accrued interest and fees 
letters of credit issued reduce the amount available for borrowing under the cit facility and  as a result  we had borrowing capacity of million at december  the following table illustrates the undrawn outstanding standby letters of credit at december  and the potential maturities if drawn upon by the holders amounts in thousands payments due by period potential total less than over contractual obligation committed year years years years standby letters of credit total assumes no acceleration of maturity date due to breach of  or default under  the potential contractual obligation 

table of contents projected cash sources and uses we expect to use cash generated from operations to cover cash requirements  including debt service on the notes and floating rate notes and capital expenditures in capital expenditures for are projected to be between million and million  subject to the actual level of rig activity and ultimate number of rig reactivations 
we will make quarterly interest payments on the floating rate notes on january  april  july  and october of each year and semi annual interest payments of million on the notes on may and november of each year through the dates of maturity 
to the extent that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations we would be required to use cash on hand or draw on our cit facility 
from time to time we also review possible acquisition opportunities 
while we currently have no agreements to acquire additional businesses or equipment  we may enter into such agreements in the future 
our ability to consummate any such transaction will be dependent in large part on our ability to fund such a transaction 
we cannot give assurance that adequate funding will be available on satisfactory terms 
results of operations our drilling contracts generally provide compensation on either a daywork  turnkey or footage basis 
successfully completed turnkey and footage contracts generally result in higher revenues per rig day worked than under daywork contracts 
ebitda per rig day worked on successful turnkey and footage jobs are also generally greater than under daywork contracts  although we are typically required to bear additional operating costs such as drill bits that would typically be paid by the customer under daywork contracts 
contract drilling revenues and ebitda on turnkey and footage contracts are affected by a number of variables  which include the depth of the well  geological complexities and the actual difficulties encountered in drilling the well 
in the following discussion of the results of our operations and elsewhere in our filings  we use ebitda and ebitda per rig day 
ebitda is a non gaap financial measure under the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec 
we believe that our disclosure of ebitda per rig day as a measure of rig operating performance allows investors to make a direct comparison between us and our competitors  without regard to differences in capital structure or to differences in the cost basis of our rigs and those of our competitors 
investors should be aware  however  that there are limitations inherent in using this performance measure as a measure of overall company profitability because it excludes significant expense items such as depreciation expense and interest expense 
an improving trend in ebitda per rig day may not be indicative of an improvement in our overall profitability 
to compensate for the limitations in utilizing ebitda per rig day as an operating measure  our management also uses gaap measures of performance including operating income loss and net income loss to evaluate performance but only with respect to the company as a whole and not on a per rig basis 
in accordance with sec rules  we have included below a reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss  which is the nearest comparable financial gaap measure

these income and expense items are not contract related and are allocated between daywork and turnkey based upon operating rig days 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and our ebitda increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from a million increase in ebitda from daywork operations and a million increase in ebitda from turnkey operations 
on a per rig day basis  our total ebitda increased by  or to  in from  in this increase included a  per rig day increase from daywork operations 
total general and administrative expenses increased by million due primarily to higher payroll costs  professional fees  and costs associated with being a public company 
daywork operations the increase in ebitda discussed above was due in part to an increase of  or  rig days worked on daywork contracts during compared to this increase in days was due to the acquisition of patriot and overall higher demand for our services 
higher dayrates in also contributed to the increase 
contract drilling revenue per rig day increased  or  the bulk of which also increased ebitda per day  which increased by  per rig day 
overall  expenses increased as a result of the increase in activity but remained relatively flat on a per rig day basis

table of contents interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for from million for the decrease is due to the issuance of the notes and floating rate notes and subsequent redemption of our notes 
this refinancing resulted in substantial interest savings given the lower interest rate debt outstanding 
our income tax expense increased by million to million in from an income tax benefit of million in the increase is due to the level of income and is also affected by the annual amortization of million in permanent differences related to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of assets that were purchased in capital stock acquisitions 
the permanent difference will be reduced as these assets are depreciated for financial accounting purposes on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives of approximately eight years 
as the amortization of these permanent differences is a fixed amount  our book effective tax rate varies widely based upon the current and projected levels of income or loss 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and our ebitda decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted from a million decrease in ebitda from daywork operations partially offset by a million increase in ebitda from turnkey operations 
on a per rig day basis  our total ebitda decreased by  or to  in from  in this decrease included a  per rig day decrease from daywork operations offset by a per rig day increase from turnkey operations 
total general and administrative expenses increased by  due primarily to higher payroll costs  professional fees  increases in insurance costs  and costs associated with being a public company

in addition  depreciation expense is higher due to capital expenditures during interest expense increased by million  or  to million for from million for interest expense in includes approximately million of costs associated with the partial redemption of our notes on july  and interest on the million aggregate principal amount of notes issued on may  these costs include a million redemption premium for the notes  million in accelerated amortization of a pro rata portion of the previously deferred financing costs on the notes  and interest on the notes from may  to june  this additional interest expense was partially offset by million lower interest for the last six months of due to the lower interest rate on the notes and million reduction in principal amount of total debt outstanding 
our income tax benefit increased by million to million in from million in the increase is due to the level of losses and a change in our estimate of available state tax net operating losses in the fourth quarter of this change in estimate increased our income tax benefit by  our income tax benefit is also affected by the annual amortization of million in permanent differences related to differences 
table of contents between the financial accounting and tax basis of assets purchased in capital stock acquisitions 
the permanent differences are amortized as these assets are depreciated for financial accounting purposes on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives of approximately nine years at december  as the annual amortization of these permanent differences is a fixed amount  our book effective tax rate can vary widely based upon the current level of income or loss 
inflation and changing prices contract drilling revenues do not necessarily track the changes in general inflation as they tend to respond to the level of activity of the oil and natural gas industry in combination with the supply of equipment and the number of competing companies 
capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and natural gas industry and to a lesser extent by changes in general inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on the floating rate notes and the cit facility 
the floating rate notes bear interest at a per annum rate which is equal to month libor  adjusted quarterly  minus a spread of 
we had million of the floating rate notes outstanding at december  a change in the interest rate on the floating rate notes would change our interest expense by million on an annual basis 
however  the annual interest on the floating rate notes will never be below zero or more than  which could yield interest expense ranging from zero to million on an annual basis 
interest on borrowings under the cit facility accrues at a variable rate  using either the prime rate plus to or libor plus to  depending upon our debt service coverage ratio for the trailing month period 
we have no outstanding balance under the cit facility at march  and as such have no exposure under this facility to a change in interest rates
