significant accounting policy judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and judgments  which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring charges  contingencies  such as litigation  and contract terms that have multiple elements and other complexities typical in the telecommunications equipment industry 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products and services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
we recognize product revenue generally upon shipment  when all four of the following criteria are met we have a contract with our customer  when delivery has occurred and risk of loss passes to the customer  when our price is fixed or determinable  and when collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
for transactions where we have not yet obtained customer acceptance  revenue is generally deferred until the terms of acceptance are satisfied 
where product revenue has been deferred  we defer the associated cost of goods until the product revenue is recognized 
revenue for installation or other services such as training is recognized upon completion of the service 
maintenance contract revenue is typically recognized ratably over the period of the contracts 
for arrangements that involve multiple elements  such as sales of products that include maintenance or installation services  revenue is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all t he undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
allowance for sales returns a reserve for sales returns is established based on actual product returns 
if the actual future returns differ from historical levels  our revenue could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  and our operating expenses could be adversely affected 
credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances for doubtful accounts receivable that were established 
inventory provisions inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to make adjustments to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or market  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
warranty accruals we generally provide a warranty for hardware product and software for twelve months 
the software warranty entitles the customer to bug fixes but not software upgrades during the warranty period 
we accrue warranty expense based on historical expense trends calculated as a percentage of new product sales 
actual expenses are charged against the accrual in the period they are incurred 
on a quarterly basis  the warranty accrual is analyzed for adequacy based on actual trends and subsequent adjustments are made to the liability balance 
if actual return rates or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
historically  all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates 
stock based compensation we account for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
accordingly  we do not record an expense for stock options granted with exercise prices greater than or equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the option grant date 
stock based compensation related to non employees is based on the fair value of the related stock or options in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
expense associated with stock based compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis under fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  over the vesting period of each individual award 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
we will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award rather than apply the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb we will recognize costs determined under sfas r over the period during which an employee provides services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period  which is usually the vesting period 
we have not yet fully quantified the effects of the adoption of sfas r  but expect that the new standard will result in significant stock based compensation expense 
the actual effects of adopting sfas r will depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model we choose to value stock based awards  the rate of forfeiture we assume  the method by which we recognize the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method we choose for adopting sfas r 
sfas r is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after june  and will be adopted by us in fiscal deferred taxes we have incurred tax losses in the last six fiscal years and  at march   we have an estimated million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available and million of state operating loss carryforwards available expiring in the years through we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  given the uncertainty as to their realization 
in future years  these benefits are available to reduce or eliminate taxes on future taxable income 
current federal and state tax laws include provisions that could limit the annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards in the event of certain defined changes in stock ownership 
our issuances of common and preferred stock could result in such a change 
accordingly  the annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited by these provisions  and this limitation may result in the loss of c arryforward benefits to the extent the above limit portion expires before it can be used 
we have not yet determined the extent of the limitation  if any

we plan to use both newer products  which serve the growing voice over internet protocol voip and broadband technology market  as well as leverage our historically strong position in the narrowband market  to drive sales in fiscal promina and sales to the government sector continue to account for the substantial majority of our revenue 
to date  we have been successful in extending the lifecycle of promina by continually expanding its functionality  but we are focused on growing revenue through our new products 
promina product revenue was   and of product revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
revenue from sales to government customers accounted for   and of revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
promina revenue has been declining  however  as the networking equipment market continues to move to ip  we are focused on growing revenue through our new products 
new product revenue has grown 
revenue from our new products  scream  shout  screamlink and netms  was million in fiscal or of product revenue compared to million or of product revenue fiscal new product revenue for fiscal was million or of product revenue 
in fiscal  the screamlink program  which enables migration of existing promina networks to broadband technology  continued to gain traction as sales increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  and none in fiscal our new products have been deployed in a variety of applications 
our newer products  which were originally introduced for telecommunications carriers  are now being deployed to other markets  principally the enterprise and government markets 
our new products have been used for applications such as migration of existing private branch exchange pbx networks to voip technology and secure communications also using voip 
our scream and shout products have also been deployed by iocs for broadband and voip applications 
to address these opportunities  we have reorganized our research and development and sales organizations  and are rebuilding our enterprise sales channel 
we incurred substantial expenses to restructure our organization 
we reduced costs and expenses throughout the organization in fiscal to allow us to achieve profitability on lower revenue 
excluding restructure costs  operating expenses decreased from fiscal to fiscal and were relatively flat in fiscal from fiscal our cash position remains strong 
total cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments at march  was million  including  in long term restricted cash related to a performance guarantee on a customer contract and our facilities lease in fremont  california 
this compares to million at march  revenue year ended year ended march march fy vs fy march fy vs fy product service and other total revenue the decrease in total revenue in fiscal from fiscal is due primarily to a decrease in product revenue 
the increase in total revenue in fiscal from fiscal is due primarily to an increase in product revenue  partially offset by a decrease in service revenue 
the decrease in product revenue in fiscal from fiscal is due primarily to decreased sales in international commercial markets 
international commercial sales decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting the general decline in the market for circuit switched products 
the increase in product revenue in fiscal from fiscal is due to strong sales in the government sales channel  which outweighed a general decline in the commercial market for circuit switched products 
government sales in fiscal  which includes sales to the federal government  its agencies  and foreign government organizations  increased million from fiscal  due largely to government defense initiatives and purchases of our new products by the federal government 
these increases were offset by decreases in international commercial sales of million in fiscal from fiscal the timing of revenue from government contracts continues to be difficult to predict  and resulting revenue varies 
product revenue is generated primarily from our circuit switched product line  promina  which accounts for the majority of our product sales worldwide 
we have developed new products  scream and shout  for the broadband equipment and ip telephony markets 
product revenue from new products  including scream  shout  screamlink  and netms  was million in fiscal or of product revenue compared to million in fiscal or of product revenue 
new product revenue for fiscal was million or of product revenue 
we expect the level of revenue from these new products  which are in the early stage of customer adoption with prolonged sales cycles  to fluctuate in the near term until we establish a broad customer base 
additionally  the recognition of revenue from some recent sales will depend on customer deployment schedules and the timing of contractual acceptance provisions being met  which could cause significant fluctuations in our revenue in the near term 
service and other revenue decreased in fiscal from fiscal the reduction in service and other revenue is primarily from non federal customers  due largely to a decline in the installed base of equipment held by them which has been offset by an increase in service revenue from government customers  as a number of these customers have contracted directly with us for service normally provided by a third party 
the decrease in service and other revenue in fiscal from fiscal is primarily the result of a general decline in the installed base of equipment held by non federal customers requiring ongoing service support 
in addition  a number of customers lowered their levels of service support in efforts to reduce their operating costs  which is enabled in part by the reliability of our promina products 
we expect that service revenue will remain relatively flat in the near term 
gross margin year ended march march march product gross margin service and other gross margin total gross margin product gross margin  service and other gross margin  and total gross margin all decreased in fiscal from fiscal and increased in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in product gross margin in fiscal from fiscal is due to lower product revenue and a higher mix of new product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue 
the lower product revenue requires relatively fixed production overhead costs to be spread over less product revenue 
our newer product lines  scream and shout  currently have lower gross margins than our promina product line  as a result of customary discounting for early customers and higher per unit costs associated with low purchase volumes of components 
the increase in product gross margin in fiscal over fiscal is due to supply chain initiatives begun in the first quarter of fiscal  which have yielded reductions in material costs  increases in product revenue  allowing fixed costs to be spread over a greater revenue base  a change in the mix of products  including a million decrease in third party product sales  which have l ower gross margins  and a one time refund in the amount of  for royalty fees paid in prior years that was received in the first quarter of fiscal the decrease in service and other gross margin in fiscal from fiscal is due to predominantly fixed costs of providing service  spread over a lower amount of service and other revenue 
the increase in service and other gross margin in fiscal from fiscal is due to reductions in compensation and related costs of million  decreases in third party service costs of  and decreases in facilities and rental costs of we expect gross margins to continue to be affected by changes in the mix of products we sell  with our newer products currently yielding gross margins lower than our overall product gross margin 
as we grow new product revenue  we expect gross margins on the new products to increase  though not necessarily to a level that would cause an increase in overall product gross margin 
operating expenses year ended year ended march march fy vs fy march fy vs fy sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructure costs total operating expenses total operating expenses were million or of total revenue in fiscal  compared to million or of total revenue in fiscal  and million or of total revenue in fiscal total operating expenses decreased or million in fiscal from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to cost cutting efforts across all functions  including restructure activity  primarily in sales and marketing and also in research and development  resulting in lower headcount 
as a result of lower headcount  compensation and related costs declined by million across all functions 
these decreases were offset by restructure costs totaling million and third party costs to implement the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act totaling  total operating expenses in fiscal decreased or million compared to total operating expenses in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower restructure costs in fiscal compared to fiscal restructure costs in fiscal and were  and million  respectively 
there were also reductions in sales and marketi ng and general and administrative spending  due largely to savings attributable to downsizing or closures of some field offices and lower legal fees from fewer legal matters and a shift from the use of outside counsel to in house resources 
these reductions were offset by an increase in research and development spending  mostly due to increased headcount 
excluding restructure costs  total operating expenses for fiscal   and were million  million  and million  respectively restructure costs in fiscal included employee separation costs of million and lease write offs and office closure costs of  offset by a benefit of  the employee separation costs resulted from two separate reorganizations of our international sales organization in the first and third quarters of fiscal  the second of which also involved research and development and other areas 
the lease write offs and office closure costs resulted from a consolidation of sales and service offices in vienna and ashburn  virginia to a single facility in dulles  virginia and closure of the research and design facility in ottawa  canada 
the benefit resulted from expiration of certain employee benefits from previous restructurings of  and adjustments to our previous lease restructuring estimates of  restructure costs in fiscal were  which consisted of  for a lease write off and  for fixed assets write offs due to the closure of a sales office in dallas  texas  offset by  in adjustments to previous lease restructuring estimates 
the closure of the sales office in dallas was in conjunction with a company wide initiative to reduce expenses across all functions 
restructure costs in fiscal were million and related to employee separation costs 
the reduction in the number of employees was primarily a result of management s intent to realign the business with revenue levels 
non operating items year ended year ended march march fy vs fy march fy vs fy interest income interest expense gain on sale of federal services business gain on insurance settlement other income expense the increase in interest income in fiscal from fiscal  primarily relating to short term investments  is the result of an increase in total cash and an improvement in returns as a result of higher yields 
total cash increased to million as of march  from million at march  the cash balance as of march  includes long term restricted cash  included in other assets on our balance sheet  of  related to performance guarantees on a customer contract and our facilities lease in fremont  california 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal from fiscal  primarily relating to short term investments  is the result of a declining yield from our investment portfolio 
interest expense in fiscal  and consisted primarily of the interest on our convertible subordinated debentures 
also included in interest expense in fiscal  and is interest related to our million note payable to our landlord for building repairs related to our former headquarters 
the note was entered into in january and was payable in monthly installments over years with interest at 
we repaid this note in full in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal   and  we recorded gains on the sale of our federal services business the federal services business of million  million  and million  respectively 
these gains resulted from certain milestones being met as part of the sale of the federal services business to caci  which are now complete 
in fiscal we recorded a non recurring gain of million related to an insurance settlement related to our former headquarters campus 
included in other expense in fiscal is a  loss on foreign exchange and  of realized losses on investments 
other income in fiscal resulted primarily from  of realized gains on investments 
included in other expense in fiscal is a  loss on sales of assets and a  loss on foreign exchange  offset by  in realized gains on investments 
income tax provision benefit income tax benefit was million in fiscal  relating to the reversal of estimated taxes for prior years upon completion of tax inspections in the united kingdom 
income tax provision was  in fiscal  due to taxes on our international business 
income tax benefit was million in fiscal each year  we evaluate the adequacy of our tax liability reserves taking into account the statute of limitations on previously filed tax returns as well as our expected net income losses 
the result of this reevaluation was to reduce the amount of reserves and record an income tax benefit in fiscal cumulative effect of change in accounting principle relating to goodwill in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill as a result of the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
this charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash balances of million  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the balance includes cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  and long term restricted cash included in other assets on our balance sheet of  related to performance guarantees on a customer contract and our facilities leases in fremont  california 
the company benefited in fiscal from million in proceeds from issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock activity  a million payment from caci as part of the sale of our federal services business  and a  refund from duty fees previously paid 
the company benefited in fiscal from million in proceeds from issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options  a million payment from caci as part of the sale of our federal services business  a  refund from royalties previously paid  and a  refund of property taxes 
net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of million and net cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal non cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal and fiscal were due primarily to depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively  offset by a gain on the sale of our federal services business of million in each year 
non cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities for fiscal were due primarily to depreciation and amortization of million  million of insurance settlement proceeds related to our former headquarters campus  and million from the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to goodwill from the implementation of sfas  offset by a mil lion gain on the sale of our federal services business and a million gain on the insurance settlement 
we expect to continue to incur charges for depreciation and amortization but will not have any future gains from the sale of our federal services business 
the other items that affect our cash flow from operations are changes in our assets and liabilities accounts  including accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other assets  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities 
days sales outstanding dso for the quarter ended march  was reduced to days as compared to days for the quarter ended march   due to the timing of orders shipped in the quarter 
net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for fiscal net cash provided by used in investing activities was in each year affected primarily by the difference between purchases of short term investments and proceeds from maturity of such investments 
in fiscal  we began turning short term investments more quickly in an effort to maximize returns 
as a result  purchases of short term investments exceeded proceeds from maturities of short term investments by million and million in fiscal and  respectively  whereas in fiscal  purchases were million less than proceeds 
net cash provided by used in investing activities in fiscal  and also included investments in property  plant and equipment of million  million and million  respectively  and proceeds from the sale of our federal services business of million  million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal   and was million  million and million  respectively  and resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock in connection with activity under employee stock plans  offset in fiscal by million in repayments on our note payable to our landlord  which was repaid in full 
our stock price was at march   at march   and at march  proceeds from the issuance of common stock from activity under employee stock plans is expected to fluctuate in relation to fluctuations in our stock price 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of march  in thousands contractual obligations total to to after long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases total contractual obligations several of our international operating leases included in these amounts expire during fiscal in fiscal  we paid approximately  in rent for these facilities 
while we expect to renew some of the leases  we cannot predict whether the renewal terms will be similar to the current leases 
from time to time  we enter into contractual commitments to purchase materials and components from suppliers in exchange for favorable pricing or more beneficial terms 
as of march   there were no such outstanding commitments 
we believe that our existing current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations  purchases of capital equipment  and research and development programs currently planned  at least through the next months 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
we will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award rather than apply intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb we will recognize costs determined under sfas r over the period during which an employee provides services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period  which is usually the vesting period 
we have not yet fully quantified the effects of the adoption of sfas r  but expect that the new standard will result in significant stock based compensation expense 
the actual effects of adopting sfas r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model we choose to value stock based awards  the rate of forfeiture we assume  the method by which we recognize the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method we choose for adopting sfas r 
sfas r is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after june  and will be adopted by us in fiscal in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment 
sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with nonemployees  the transition from nonpublic to public entity status  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issued under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  first time adoption of statement r in an interim period  capitalization of compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements  the accounting for income tax effects of share based payment arrangements upon adoption of statement r  the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of statement r and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis md a subsequent to adoption of statement r 
we will adopt the provisions of sab  as appropriate  upon implementation of fasr in fiscal in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the effective date of this standard is for fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated statement of operations and financial condition  but do not expect it to h ave a material impact 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
the amendments made by sfas are intended to improve financial reporting by clarifying that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and by requiring the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after november  the provisions of sfas will be applied prospectively 
our historical treatment of inventory costs is consistent with sfas  and we therefore do not expect the adoption of sfas to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
business environment and risk factors our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described below 
although we have tried to identify the material risks to our business  this is not an all inclusive list 
there may be additional risks that have not yet been identified and risks that are not material now but could become material 
any one of these risks could hurt our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have incurred net losses in the past and may continue to incur losses in the future 
for each of the past six fiscal years  we have incurred net losses 
although we have reduced operating expenses over the past several years  we will need revenue to grow in order to achieve profitability 
our circuit switched product line  promina  currently provides the majority of our revenue  but revenue from that product line may decline within the next few years 
our newer broadband and ip telephony product lines  scream and shout  have not yet achieved market acceptance or broad commercial sales  and we are incurring substantial product development and marketing expenses for those product lines 
accordingly  we will not likely be profitable unless our newer product lines achieve commercial success that outpaces the anticipated decline of our promina product line 
in addition  we must contain our operating expenses  many of which are fixed in the short term making it difficult to reduce expenses rapidly in response to shortfalls i n revenue 
our operating results may continue to fluctuate 
our operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations may result from a number of factors  including changes in demand for our products  particularly our narrow band promina product line  the timing of orders from and shipments to our customers  the timing of the introduction of  and market acceptance for  new products and services  variations in the mix of products and services we sell  the timing and level of certain expenses  such as marketing activities  prototype costs  or write offs of obsolete inventory  the timing of revenue recognition  which depends on numerous factors  such as contractual acceptance provisions and separability of arrangements involving multiple elements  including some factors that are out of our control  such as assurance as to collectibility  the adoption of new accounting standards  such as changes to revenue recognition principles or the requirement to record expenses for employee stock option grants  the timing and size of federal government budget approvals and spending  and timing of government deployment schedules  and economic conditions in the telecommunications industry  including the overall capital expenditures of our customers 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
any shortfall in revenue may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
investors should not rely on our results or growth for one quarter as any indication of our future performance 
our stock price is volatile and could decline substantially 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  will likely continue to fluctuate in the future and may decline 
fluctuations or a decline in our stock price may occur regardless of our performance 
among the factors that could affect our stock price  in addition to our performance  are variations between our operating results and either the guidance we have furnished to the public or the published expectations of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  new products or services  acquisitions  or other significant transactions  sale of our common stock or other securities in the future  the inclusion or exclusion of our stock in various indices or investment categories  especially as compared to the investment profiles of our stockholders at a given time  changes in the stock prices of other telecommunications equipment companies  to the extent that some investors tend to buy or sell our stock based on segment trends  and the trading volume of our common stock 
we are dependent on revenue from the promina product line 
currently  we derive the majority of our product revenue from our promina product line  a circuit based narrowband technology 
the market for our promina product is expected to decline as networks are expected to increasingly employ packet based broadband technology 
this technology migration resulted in a significant drop in sales of our promina products in the commercial markets over the last several years 
if this decline extends into our government markets in a similar fashion before we gain traction on our newer packet based broadband product lines  our revenue will decrease  and our business and results of operations will suffer 
although we have developed a migration path to broadband technology through the screamlink program  this strategy may not materially mitigate this decline 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from sales to governmental agencies 
a significant portion of our total revenue from product sales comes from contracts with governmental agencies  most of which do not include long term purchase commitments 
historically  the government has been slower to adopt new technology  such as packet based technology  which has had the effect of extending the product life of our promina product 
while the government has purchased and is evaluating some of our new products for broader deployment  this new business may not be sufficient to offset expected declines in sales of our promina product 
furthermore  if the government accelerated adoption of new technology  and replaced the promina product line in their networks with products other than ours  our product revenue would decline sharply 
we anticipate that our past experience will result in future contracts with the government  however  we face significant competition in this endeavor 
if we fail in renewing a significant num ber of government contracts or if sales to the government decline sharply  our revenue may not increase to profitable levels 
through an agreement resulting from the sale of our federal services business to caci  caci provides maintenance and other services to our federal government customers 
if for any reason our mutual customers are unsatisfied with the services  it could adversely affect sales of our products 
our success depends on our ability to develop new products and product enhancements that will achieve market acceptance 
our operating results will depend on the successful design  development  testing  introduction  marketing  and broad commercial distribution of our newer packet based products  the scream and shout product lines  as well as successful evolution of our promina product line incorporating packet based technology 
the success of these and other new products is dependent on several factors  including proper product definition  competitive pricing  timely completion and introduction to the market  differentiation from competitors products  and broad market acceptance 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks 
for sales to telecommunications carriers  we face stringent product requirements and a reluctance to purchase products from vendors lacking substantial revenue and asse ts 
we may not successfully identify new product opportunities  develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner  or achieve market acceptance of our products 
products and technologies developed by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or non competitive  which in turn could adversely affect our ability to achieve profitability 
gross margins could decline over future periods 
gross margins may be adversely affected in the future due to increases in material and labor costs  increases in subcontractor charges  changes in the mix of products and services we sell  increased sales through resellers  increased warranty costs  or pressure on pricing and margins due to competition 
our newer product lines  scream and shout  currently have lower gross margins than our promina product line  as a result of customary discounting for early customers and higher per unit costs associated with low purchase volumes of components 
a decline in our gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
factors beyond our control could affect our ability to sell into international markets 
we conduct sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states and depend on non us operations of our subsidiaries and distribution partners 
as a general rule  international sales tend to have risks that are difficult to foresee and plan for  including political and economic stability  regulatory changes  currency exchange rates  changes in tax rates and structures  and collection of accounts receivable 
further  our international markets are served primarily by non exclusive resellers who themselves may be severely affected by economic or market changes within a particular country or region 
our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors that could affect these activities 
unforeseen or unpredictable changes in international markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the market for our products is highly competitive and many of our competitors have greater resources than us 
the market for telecommunication equipment is highly competitive and dynamic  has been characterized by rapid technological changes and shifting customer requirements  and has seen a worldwide migration from existing circuit technology to the new packet based technologies 
we compete directly  both internationally and domestically  with many different companies  some of which are large  established suppliers of end to end solutions  such as alcatel  cisco  juniper  lucent  nortel and siemens 
in addition to some of these large suppliers  a number of other smaller companies are targeting the same market as us 
additional competition for scream includes redback  and for our shout product line  competition includes quintum and audiocodes 
some of our larger competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we have and offer a wider range of networking products than we offer 
they are often able to devote greater resources to the development  marketing and sale of their products and to use their equity or significant cash reserves to acquire other companies with technology and or products that compete directly with ours 
they often can compete favorably on price because their large product selection allows them to bundle multiple solutions together without significantly affecting their overall product margins 
the smaller companies have more ability than net 
com to focus their resources on a particular product development unencumbered by the requirements to support an existing product line 
as a result of the flexibility of their market strategies  our competitors may be able to obtain strategic advantages that may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the networking equipment market has seen the constant introduction of new technologies that has reduced the value of older technology solutions 
this has created pricing pressure on older products while increasing the performance expectations of newer networking equipment 
moreover  broadband technology standards are constantly evolving and alternative technologies or technologies with greater capability are constantly introduced and sought by our customers 
it is possible that the introduction of other technologies will either supplant our current technologies and technologies we have in development or will require us to significantly lower our prices in order to remain competitive 
to remain competitive  we must continue to evolve our scream and shout product lines to meet the ever changing technology needs of the networking market while ensuring that they can be sold at a competitive price 
we also must enhance our prom ina product line to provide needed features that increase its overall value for the customer while keeping the price competitive 
due to the competitive nature of the market and the relative age of our promina product offerings as well as the competitive pressure being exerted on our scream and shout technologies  we may not be able to maintain prices for them at levels that will sustain profitability 
if we are unable to sign competitive resale partners  our future product and service revenue will be adversely affected 
our international sales are made almost entirely through indirect channels that include distributors and resellers worldwide  and our business strategy includes leveraging resale partners in the united states 
in addition  many of our target customers  including telecommunication service providers  rely on systems integrators to incorporate new equipment or services into their networks  and the independent operating companies iocs often work with engineering firms and make purchasing decisions as consortia 
while we have begun the process of identifying and signing software application  system integrator and oem or resale partners  more partners are necessary in these areas for us to be successful 
we may also need to pursue strategic partnerships with vendors who have broader technology or product offerings in order to compete with the end to end solution providers 
failure to sign up new reseller and strategic partners could affect our ability to grow overall revenue 
our distributors and resellers often also resell product lines from other companies  including our competitors  some of whom have strong market position relative to net 
com 
because of existing relationships that many of our competitors have with distributors and resellers  it is often difficult for us to find a distributor or reseller who is willing and contractually able to resell our products 
if we cannot develop relationships with distributors and resellers that can effectively market and sell our products and services  our future revenue will be adversely affected 
our existing reseller agreements do not have minimum purchase requirements 
our products have long sales cycles  making it difficult to predict when a customer will place an order and when to forecast revenue from the related sale 
our products are very complex and represent a significant capital expenditure to our customers 
the purchase of our products can have a significant impact on how a customer designs its network and provides services either within its own organization or to an external customer 
consequently  our customers often engage in extensive testing and evaluation of products before purchase 
there are also numerous financial and budget considerations and approvals that the customer often must obtain before it will issue a purchase order 
as a result  the length of our sales cycle can be quite long  extending beyond twelve months in some cases 
in addition  our customers  including resellers  often have the contractual right to delay scheduled order delivery dates with minimal penalties and to cancel orders within specified time frames without penalty  which makes it difficult to predict whether or not an order may actually ship 
we often must inc ur substantial sales and marketing expense to ensure a purchase order is placed 
if the order is not placed in the quarter forecasted  our sales may not meet forecast and revenue may be insufficient to meet expenses 
because it is difficult for us to accurately forecast sales  particularly within a given time frame  we face a risk of carrying too much or too little inventory 
typically  the majority of our revenue in each quarter has resulted from orders received and shipped in that quarter 
while we do not believe that backlog is necessarily indicative of future revenue levels  our customers ordering patterns and the possible absence of backlogged orders create a significant risk that we could carry too much or too little inventory if orders do not match forecasts 
rather than base forecasts on orders received  we have been forced to schedule production and commit to certain expenses based more upon forecasts of future sales  which are difficult to predict in the telecommunications industry 
if large orders do not close when forecasted or if near term demand weakens for the products we have available to ship  our operating results for that quarter or subsequent quarters would be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  if there is an unexpected decrease in demand for certain products or there is a n increased risk of inventory obsolescence  which can happen relatively quickly due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  adjustments may be required to write down or write off the inventory  which would adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to retain existing employees and attract  recruit and retain key personnel  then we may not be able to successfully manage our business 
our success continues to be dependent on our being able to attract and retain highly skilled engineers  managers and other key employees 
in most cases  we face significant competition for the most qualified personnel for new positions and to replace departing employees 
if we are not able to continue to attract  recruit and retain key personnel  particularly in engineering  sales and marketing positions  we may be unable to meet important company objectives such as product delivery deadlines and sales targets 
our ability to ship our products in a timely manner is dependent on the availability of component parts and other factors 
several key components of our products are available only from a single source  including certain integrated circuits  and power supplies 
depending upon the component  there may or may not be alternative sources or substitutes 
some components are purchased through purchase orders without an underlying long term supply contract  and some components are in short supply generally throughout the industry 
if a required component were no longer available  we might have to significantly reengineer the affected product 
further  variability in demand and cyclical shortages of capacity in the semiconductor industry have caused lead times for ordering parts to increase from time to time 
delays may occur as a result of factors beyond our control  including weather related delays 
if we encounter shortages or delays in receiving ordered components or if we are not able to accurately forecast our ordering requirements  we may be unable to ship ordered products in a timely manner  resulting in decreased revenue 
generally  our customer contracts allow the customers to reschedule delivery dates or cancel orders within certain time frames before shipment without penalty and outside those time frames with a penalty 
because of these and other factors  there are risks of excess or inadequate inventory that could negatively affect our expenses  revenue and earnings 
additionally  dx rated orders from the federal government  which by law receive priority  can interrupt scheduled shipments to our other customers 
we single source our manufacturing processes  a failure or delay by a contract manufacturing vendor could affect our ability to ship our products timely 
we outsource all product manufacturing  including assembly and structural test  and have recently consolidated our outsourced manufacturing to a single vendor 
in addition  we are in the process of outsourcing to that vendor the functional test  systems integration  and order fulfillment functions  which  historically  we have performed in house at our fremont  california facility 
any difficulties with the transition could cause delays in customer product shipments or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations 
while subcontracting creates substantial cost efficiencies in the manufacturing process  it also exposes us to delays in product shipments should the contract manufacturer be unable to perform 
we have agreed to compensate our contract manufacturers in the event of termination or cancellation of orders  discontinuance of product  or excess material created by an engineering change 
also  should a contract manufacture r in some future period decide not to renew our contract with them  it would be difficult for us to quickly transfer our manufacturing requirements to another vendor  likely causing substantial delays in customer product shipments and affecting our revenue and results of operations 
if we transition product manufacturing to a new vendor  or transition more manufacturing functions to third parties  the transition itself and the lack of experience and adjustments to working with the new vendor could cause delays in customer product shipments or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations 
our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business 
our future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology 
although we attempt to establish and maintain rights in proprietary technology and products through patents  copyrights  and trade secrets laws  we cannot predict whether such protection will be adequate  or whether our competitors can develop similar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights 
as competition in the communications equipment industry increases and the functionality of the products in this industry further overlap  we believe that companies in the communications equipment industry may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
we have received and may continue to receive notice from third parties  including some of our competitors  claiming that we are infringing their patents or their other proprietary rights 
we cannot predict whether we will prevail in any litigation over third party claims  or that we will be able to l icense any valid and infringed patents on commercially reasonable terms 
any of these claims  whether with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  divert our management s time  attention and resources  delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  a third party may not be willing to enter into a royalty or licensing agreement on acceptable terms  if at all 
if a claim of product infringement against us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop or license non infringing technology  we may be unable to market the affected product 
although we have a number of patent applications pending  we cannot guarantee that any will result in the issuance of a patent 
even if issued  the patent may later be found to be invalid or may be infringed without our knowledge 
our issued patents might not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction and it is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of our proprietary technology by others 
regardless of our efforts to protect our intellectual property  the rapidly changing technologies in the networking industry make our future success primarily a function of the skill  expertise and management abilities of our employees 
nonetheless  others may assert property rights to technologies that are relevant to us 
if our protected proprietary rights are challenged  invalidated or circumvented  it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and sales of our products 
we rely on technologies licensed from third parties 
for each of our product lines  we license some of our technology from third parties 
these licenses are generally limited in duration or by the volume of shipments of the licensed technology 
in addition  some of these licenses contain limitations on distribution of the licensed technology or provide for expiration upon certain events  such as a change in control of the company 
if the relevant licensing agreement expires or is terminated without our being able to renew that license on commercially reasonable terms  or if we cannot obtain a license for our products or enhancements on our existing products we may be unable to market the affected products 
for many of these technologies  we rely on the third party provider to update and maintain the technology  fixing errors and adding new features 
if the third party provider does not adequately update and maintain these technologies  whether due to changes in their product direction  t heir own financial difficulties  or other reasons  we would need to seek alternative means to fulfill the ongoing requirements for our products that incorporate the third party technology 
if we are unable to find alternative means of fulfilling the ongoing requirements  we may be unable to market the affected products 
we face risks associated with changes in telecommunications regulations and tariffs  including regulation of the internet 
the demand for our broadband products could be affected by rulings of the federal communication commission fcc and federal courts regarding services offered in the united states by telecommunications carriers to their customers 
significant regulatory issues include rules regarding the unbundling of broadband and new fiber facilities and equipment used to provide services such as dsl  and whether wireline broadband internet access services are telecommunication services or information services  which would result in less regulation 
telecommunications carriers  who represent the primary target market for our scream product line  face regulatory uncertainties that could further delay their equipment purchases 
also  if other rulings or regulations of the fcc diminish the attractiveness of offering such services  then telecommunications service providers would likely have less need for our products 
changes in domestic and international telecommunications equipment requirements could affect the sales of our products 
in the united states  our products must comply with various fcc requirements and regulations 
in countries outside of the united states  our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities 
changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could impact our ability to market the affected product 
in addition  there are currently few laws or regulations that govern access or commerce on the internet 
if individual countries  or groups of countries  acting in concert  began to impose regulations or standards on internet access or commerce including ip telephony  our ability to sell our new scream and shout products or other new products would be adversely impacted if the regulations or standards resulted in decreased demand or increased costs for our products 
new restrictions on trade  such as in response to transfers of jobs from the united states to lower cost foreign locations  could limit our ability to purchase components from  or outsource functions to  foreign entities  which would likely make it more difficult to maintain competitiveness in the global market 
as a result of our current concentration of business to the federal government  we are more sensitive to these trade restrictions  whether tariffs  incentives  or government purchasing requirements such as the buy american act  than we would be with a more diversified customer base 
in north america  the former regional bell operating companies rbocs recommend that telcordia technologies  inc certify telecommunications equipment under its operations systems modifications for the integration of network elements osmine program in order to ensure interoperability with other network elements and operational support systems 
the osmine certification process is expensive and lengthy  and we have not completed it for our product lines 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
in fiscal  we commenced using foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant accounts receivable and intercompany account balances denominated in foreign currencies 
although we have established foreign exchange contracts for non dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in the united kingdom  france  germany and japan  exposures remain for non dollar denominated operating expenses in latin america  canada  and asia 
we will continue to monitor our exposure and may hedge against these or any other emerging market currencies as necessary 
market value gains and losses on hedge contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged 
the location of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquake and floods 
our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development operations  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
these facilities are located near the san francisco bay where the water table is quite close to the surface and where tenants have experienced water intrusion problems in the facilities nearby 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or flood  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
any material weakness or significant deficiency identified in our internal controls could have an adverse effect on our business 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that companies evaluate and report on their internal control structure and procedures over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent accountants must report on management s evaluation as well as evaluate our internal control structure and procedures 
due to the ongoing evaluation and testing of our internal controls  there can be no assurance that there may not be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in the future 
in addition  the evaluation process and any required remediation  if applicable  may increase our accounting  legal and other costs  and may divert management resources from other business objectives and concerns 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosure involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we began using foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant accounts receivable and intercompany account balances denominated in foreign currencies 
market value gains and losses on these hedged contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged 
at march   our primary net foreign currency exposures were in japanese yen  british pounds  and euros 
the net financial impact of foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded in other income 
our policy is to not use hedges or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we believe our hedging strategy will not have a significant effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
a adverse change in the foreign currency rates affecting the contracts as of their march  levels would decrease the fair value of the contracts by approximately  and if this occurred  the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts should increase or decrease by a similar amount 
however  we could have gains or losses in the future if our actual balances differ from the amounts hedged under foreign exchange contracts 
the amount of such gains or losses would depend in part on the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
a portion of our investment portfolio is composed of income securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease of from levels at march  and march  indicated the fair value of the portfolio would change by approximately  at march  and an immaterial amount at march  at march   the fair value of the short term investments was million compared to million at march  the fair market value of our convertible subordinated debentures is sensitive to changes in interest rates and to the prices of our common stock into which it can be converted as well as our financial stability 
the yield to maturity on the debentures is fixed  therefore the interest expense on the debt does not fluctuate with interest rates 
at march   the fair value of the trading debt securities was approximately million compared to million at march
