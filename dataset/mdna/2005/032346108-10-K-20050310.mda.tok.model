item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview amylin pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of drug candidates for the treatment of diabetes  obesity and cardiovascular disease 
we currently have two first in class lead drug candidates in late stage development for the treatment of diabetes  exenatide and symlin pramlintide acetate  that have completed phase clinical studies and are under regulatory review in the united states 
exenatide is the first in a new class of compounds known as incretin mimetics 
we are developing exenatide  including both twice daily and sustained release formulations  with lilly to improve glucose control in patients with type diabetes who are not achieving target glucose levels with metformin and or sulfonylureas  two of the most commonly used oral therapies to treat type diabetes  pursuant to a global development and commercialization agreement entered into in our agreement with lilly provides for equal sharing of exenatide operating profits in the united states 
operating profits outside of the united states are split to lilly and to us 
we submitted a new drug application  or nda  to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for the twice daily formulation of exenatide in june and we expect the fda to respond to this filing by april  symlin is the first in a new class of compounds called amylinomimetics and is a synthetic version of human amylin  a hormone co secreted with insulin in normal physiology 
we are developing symlin for the treatment of patients with type diabetes and insulin using patients with type diabetes 
in december we received a second approvable letter for symlin from the fda 
in september we submitted a complete response to the fda  which is intended to answer all of the questions that need to be addressed prior to approval 
we expect the fda to respond to this new submission by march  our pipeline includes a phase program for each of the therapeutic areas of diabetes  obesity and cardiovascular disease 
additionally  we have two phase programs and maintain a discovery research program focused on peptide therapeutics 
we are actively seeking to in license additional drug candidates 
in we are preparing to expand our organization to support the potential commercial launches of exenatide and symlin  pending regulatory approvals 
this planned expansion will require a significant investment in our commercial capabilities  including the addition of approximately field personnel  including our sales force  and medical affairs and managed care personnel  and increased medical education activities 
in addition  we anticipate expanding our business infrastructure in to support these activities 
we also intend to continue our investment in our research and development programs  as more fully described below under the heading research and development programs 
since our inception in september  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
all of our revenues to date have been derived from fees and expense reimbursements under our exenatide collaboration agreement with lilly  previous symlin collaborative agreements and co promotion agreements with each of lilly and reliant pharmaceuticals  inc we currently have no approved products and we have not received any revenues from the sale of any of our drug candidates 
we have been unprofitable since inception and expect to incur additional operating losses for at least the next few years 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in february we completed a public offering of our common stock  generating net proceeds to us of approximately million 
we do not expect to generate positive operating cash flows for at least the next few years and accordingly  we will need to raise additional funds from outside sources 
refer to the discussion under the heading liquidity and capital resources for further discussion regarding our anticipated future capital requirements 
research and development programs currently  our research and development efforts are focused on programs for the treatment of diabetes  obesity and cardiovascular disease in various stages of development as summarized in the following table phase of development compound proposed indication regulatory review exenatide type diabetes symlin pramlintide acetate type and insulin dependent type diabetes phase exenatide lar type diabetes ac pramlintide acetate obesity ac glp late stage congestive heart failure phase ac pyy obesity ac atherosclerosis from inception through  we devoted substantially all of our research and development efforts to symlin 
beginning in  our research and development costs started to include costs for our other drug candidates  primarily exenatide and exenatide lar 
as we continue to expand our pipeline  our investment in our other programs will continue to increase 
the drug development process  from discovery through regulatory approval  takes an average of years according to recent industry reports 
the process includes several steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation leading up to the submission of an investigational new drug application  or ind to the fda  which allows for the initiation of the clinical evaluation in humans of a potential drug candidate 
clinical evaluation is typically comprised of three phases of study  phase  phase and phase generally  the majority of a drug candidate s total development costs are incurred during phase  as these trials are typically the longest and largest trials conducted during the drug development process 
successful completion of phase clinical testing is followed by the submission of an nda to the fda for marketing approval 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of an nda  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
following initial regulatory approval for a drug candidate  companies generally initiate additional clinical trials aimed at expanding product labels and market potential 
the timing and costs to complete the successful development of any of our drug candidates are highly uncertain  and therefore difficult to estimate 
our research and development expenses are comprised of salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and a portion of our facilities costs 
we charge direct internal and external program costs to the respective development programs 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs because such costs benefit multiple development programs and allow us to increase our overall pharmaceutical development capabilities 
these consist primarily of facilities costs and other internal shared resources related to the development and maintenance of systems and processes applicable to all of our programs 
the following table provides information regarding our research and development expenses for our major projects in millions year ended december  exenatide symlin phase programs early stage programs and research unallocated exenatide our development activities for exenatide included the continuation of ongoing open label studies  additional clinical studies to both support regulatory filings outside of the united states and increase our understanding of exenatide s market potential in the united states and elsewhere  preparation of our nda filing with the fda and the continuation of manufacturing scale up 
in july  we announced the results from a six month clinical study that compared exenatide and insulin glargine in patients failing to achieve acceptable glycemic control with common oral therapies 
in connection with the results of this study we received a million milestone payment from lilly 
our development activities for exenatide are planned to include the continuation of ongoing studies to support regulatory filings outside of the united states and the continuation of an ongoing study in patients who are currently not achieving target blood glucose concentrations using thiazolidinediones  or tzds  another common oral therapy used to treat type diabetes 
in addition  we have additional clinical research that we intend to pursue for label expansion following regulatory approval  if received 
the timing of material net cash inflows from our exenatide development program is dependent upon regulatory approvals and subsequent market acceptance 
symlin in september we submitted a complete response document to the fda  which is intended to answer all of the questions that need to be addressed prior to approval 
we expect the fda to respond to this new submission by march  pending the fda s response  our research and development efforts for symlin will continue to be limited to specific activities  primarily those related to the continuation of ongoing open label clinical studies 
the timing of material net cash inflows from symlin is dependent upon regulatory approvals and subsequent market acceptance 
phase programs we currently have a phase program in each of the therapeutic areas of diabetes  obesity and cardiovascular disease 
in diabetes  we are studying exenatide lar  a sustained release formulation of exenatide 
we recently initiated a phase multi dose study of exenatide lar  utilizing a once a week dosing regimen 
this study was initiated following the review of data from a phase single dose study completed in early we are developing exenatide lar in collaboration with lilly and alkermes 
in obesity  we are studying ac pramlintide acetate  the same compound contained in symlin 
following the review of data from a week phase study completed in  we are preparing to commence a phase b dose ranging study of ac in in cardiovascular disease  we have a phase program for ac glp for the treatment of congestive heart failure 
we submitted an ind for ac in the second half of and initiated a phase study in the fourth quarter of early stage programs and research in addition to our late stage development programs in diabetes and our phase programs in diabetes  obesity and cardiovascular disease  we also have two phase programs 
we are studying ac pyy for potential utility as a treatment for obesity 
we are studying ac for the treatment of atherosclerosis related cardiovascular disease 
we also maintain a discovery research program focused on peptide therapeutics and we are actively seeking to in license additional drug candidates 
results of operations revenue under collaborative agreements revenue under collaborative agreements was million in  compared to million in and million in substantially all of the revenue recorded in these periods consists of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration agreement with lilly for exenatide 
the following table summarizes the components of revenues under collaborative agreements for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  amortization of up front payment recognition of milestone payments cost sharing and co promotion payments the million decrease in revenue under collaborative agreements in  as compared to  reflects a shift in the relative proportion of total development expenses related to exenatide recorded by us and by lilly and a reduction in milestone revenue 
milestone revenue in consists of a million payment from lilly in connection with the results of a clinical study comparing exenatide to insulin glargine in the third quarter of milestone revenue in consisted of a million payment from lilly following the completion of the three pivotal phase trials for exenatide in the fourth quarter of the increase in  as compared to  reflects a partial year of activity following the signing of the collaboration agreement in september in september  lilly made an million non refundable payment to us  and we agreed to incur the first million of development costs following the date of the agreement 
accordingly  we recorded of the first million of us development costs for exenatide  whether incurred by us or by lilly  and we recorded as revenue approximately of these development costs through an amortization of million of the up front payment  which amortization was completed during the third quarter of the remaining million is being amortized to revenues ratably over a year period 
during the third quarter of  we reached the million level of cumulative exenatide development costs 
subsequently  lilly became responsible to fund  on an ongoing basis  of development costs in the united states and of development costs outside of the united states 
while we continue to lead exenatide development efforts in the united states  lilly is also directly incurring exenatide development expenses and makes cost sharing payments to us to equalize development costs  which are recorded as revenues under collaborative agreements in the period in which the related development expenses are incurred 
in future periods  revenue under collaborative agreements will consist of ongoing cost sharing payments from lilly to equalize united states development costs  possible future milestone payments  the continued amortization of the million portion of the up front payment  amounts earned pursuant to our co promotion agreement with reliant and also may include revenues under collaborative agreements entered into in the future 
the amount of cost sharing revenue recorded will be dependent on the timing  extent and relative proportion of total development costs for the exenatide development program incurred by us and by lilly 
the receipt and recognition as revenue of future milestone payments is subject to the achievement of performance requirements underlying such milestone payments and  for certain development milestones  the expiration of stock conversion rights associated with such payments 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in compared to reflects reduced expenses of million and million for our exenatide and symlin development programs  respectively  partially offset by increased expenses of million for our phase programs and a million increase in unallocated research and development expenses 
the million decrease in exenatide expenses in as compared to primarily reflects reduced clinical development costs due primarily to the completion of the pivotal phase program for exenatide in the fourth quarter of and the fact that we recorded of exenatide development expenses  including those incurred by lilly through the third quarter of the million decrease in symlin expenses in as compared to primarily reflects reduced clinical development costs in due primarily to the completion in of a dose titration trial  and several smaller trials that formed the basis of an nda amendment for symlin submitted to the fda in june the million increase in expenses for our phase programs in as compared to primarily reflects increased clinical development costs for our ac development program for obesity associated with the week phase study completed in it also includes to a lesser extent increased development expenses for exenatide lar associated with a single dose phase study in and increased costs for manufacturing scale up for exenatide lar 
the million increase in unallocated research and development expenses in as compared to primarily reflects increased facilities costs  a portion of which are allocated to research and development expense 
we expect that our research and development expenses in will increase slightly compared to our planned development activities include the continuation of development work to expand our knowledge of the clinical utility of exenatide and to support regulatory submissions outside of the united states 
we also plan to continue to advance our phase development programs 
the million increase in research and development expenses in compared to reflects growth across all aspects of our research and development programs 
exenatide development expenses increased by million in as compared to due primarily to costs associated with the three pivotal phase trials  including open label extensions of those trials  and the fact that we recorded of exenatide development expenses for the majority of  whether incurred by us or by lilly 
symlin development expenses increased by million in as compared to  which reflects increased costs associated with the completion of the dose titration trial completed in and increased costs associated with manufacturing scale up 
unallocated research and development expenses increased by million in as compared to  principally due to increased facilities costs 
the million increase in costs for our phase programs in as compared to primarily reflects costs associated with formulation development for exenatide lar 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in the years ended december   and respectively 
the million increase in as compared to reflects increased business support and facilities costs to support future product launches and to a lesser extent increased pre launch expenses  consisting primarily of medical education activities for exenatide 
the million increase in compared to is due primarily to costs associated with the continued investment in our commercial and business support organizations to support future product launches  as well as increased facilities costs required to support our growth 
the expansion of our commercial organization in included the addition of a person sales force  increased medical education activities for smylin  and growth in our managed care and other sales support functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase significantly in to support the potential commercial launch of exenatide and symlin  if approved 
this expected increase reflects continuing investments to prepare us for commercialization in the early part of more significant increases are planned around the potential approval of exenatide  including the addition of to field personnel  expanded medical education activities to support a full market launch and further increases in our business infrastructure 
a significant portion of this business infrastructure will support our launch plans for symlin 
other income and expense interest and other income consist primarily of interest income from investment of cash and investments 
interest and other income was million in  million in  and million in the decrease in reflects the fact that in interest and other income included a one time million gain on early retirement of debt at a discount 
the increase in as compared to reflects primarily the aforementioned million gain and higher average cash reserves available for investment 
interest and other expense consist primarily of interest expense resulting from long term debt obligations and include interest payments and the amortization of debt interest costs 
interest and other expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in reflects additional interest expense associated with the issuance million of convertible senior notes in april net loss our net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the increase in the net loss in compared to primarily reflects the decrease in revenue under collaborative agreements  partially offset by the decrease in operating expenses discussed above 
the increase in the net loss in compared to reflects the increased operating expenses  partially offset by the increases in revenues from collaborative agreement and interest and other income  discussed above 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next few years due to ongoing expenses associated with the continuation and potential expansion of our research and development programs  exenatide  exenatide lar  and our earlier stage development programs  the planned commercialization of exenatide and symlin and related general and administrative support 
operating losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of expenses incurred and revenues recognized 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of common stock and preferred stock  debt financings  payments received pursuant to our exenatide collaboration with lilly and reimbursement of symlin development expenses through earlier collaboration agreements 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at december  the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in primarily reflects approximately million provided by our financing activities  partially offset by million used to fund operating activities during financing activities in include million in net proceeds from a private placement of convertible senior notes in april in february we completed a public offering of our common stock  generating net proceeds to us of approximately million 
we expect our use of cash to fund our operating activities to increase during  as compared to this expected increase primarily reflects continuing investments to prepare us for the planned commercialization of exenatide and symlin in the early part of more significant increases are planned around the potential approval of exenatide  including the addition of to field personnel  expanded medical education activities to support a full market launch and further increases in our business infrastructure 
a significant portion of this business infrastructure will support our launch plans for symlin 
in december  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  which currently allows us to sell up to million of various securities in one or more offerings in the future 
the terms of any offering will be established at the time of sale 
the sec declared this registration statement effective in february in february we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock pursuant to this shelf registration  generating net proceeds to us of approximately million 
we also have a loan facility available from lilly that  subject to certain defined development and regulatory events  over time could provide us up to million to fund a portion of our development and commercialization costs for exenatide 
at december   million of this facility was available to us and there were no amounts outstanding 
we expect approximately million to be available following fda approval  if any  of exenatide 
any loans under this facility would be secured by some of our patents and other tangible assets and  at lilly s option  are convertible into our common stock if amounts remain outstanding for more than two years 
we used cash of million  million and million for our operating activities in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our operating activities in and reflect payments received from lilly of a million milestone payment and an million up front payment  respectively 
our investing activities used million  million and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
investing activities in all three years consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments  but also included purchases of laboratory and office equipment and patent additions 
financing activities provided million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts consisted primarily of proceeds from sales of common stock and the issuance of convertible senior notes  partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
at december   we had outstanding long term debt of million 
this amount includes million aggregate principal amount of the senior convertible notes due  or the notes 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to million shares of our common stock at approximately per share 
under certain circumstances  the notes are redeemable in whole or in part  at our option  on or after june   at specified redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the remainder of our long term debt balance at december  consists of million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes due  or the notes 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to million shares of our common stock at approximately per share 
the notes are not redeemable at our option 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and maturity dates as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total excludes long term obligation of million related to deferred compensation  the payment of which is subject to elections made by participants that are subject to change 
in addition  under certain license and collaboration agreements with other companies we are required to pay royalties and or milestone payments upon the successful development and commercialization of related products 
we do not expect to make any significant milestone payments under these agreements within months from the date of this report 
at december   we had outstanding commitments to purchase approximately million of symlin and exenatide inventory 
if fda approval for exenatide or symlin is received  our commitments to purchase inventories will increase substantially 
some of our commercial supply agreements for exenatide and symlin have minimum annual purchase requirements if fda approval is received 
additionally  if fda approval for symlin is received  we are committed to purchase approximately million of symlin bulk drug material from a former collaborative partner 
we are also obligated to purchase this material if we enter into a collaboration agreement for symlin or if there is a change in control of amylin 
if none of these events occur  we have no obligation to purchase this material 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for exenatide and symlin  whether regulatory approvals for the marketing of exenatide and or symlin are received  if regulatory approvals are received  costs associated with the commercialization of exenatide and or symlin and our ability to effectively market exenatide and or symlin  our ability to receive milestone payments or access to loan amounts pursuant to our collaboration with lilly  our ability and the extent to which we establish commercialization arrangements  if any  for symlin  our ability to progress with other ongoing and new clinical and preclinical trials and the extent of these trials  progress in our other research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing or defending our patents  competing technological and market developments  changes in or new collaborative relationships  costs of manufacturing  including scale up costs of our drug candidates  the costs of potential licenses or acquisitions  and the need to repay existing indebtedness 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory costs and patent costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our consolidated financial statements on page f 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines on the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
amounts received for upfront product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  and the expiration of stock conversion rights  if any  associated with such payments 
amounts received for equalization of development expenses are recognized in the period in which the related expenses are incurred 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
inventory and related reserves we capitalize inventory costs associated with our drug candidates prior to receipt of regulatory approval  based on management s judgment of probable future commercialization 
we would be required to expense these capitalized costs upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other factors  a decision denying approval of the drug candidate by regulatory agencies 
at december   gross capitalized inventory  the majority of which relates to symlin  totaled million 
our ability to recover the value of this inventory is dependent upon our ability to obtain regulatory approvals to market symlin in the united states and or other markets 
additionally  approximately million of the million of total inventory of symlin is in finished dosage form  the majority of which was manufactured in late our nda  as amended and supplemented  suggests that the finished inventory should have a thirty six month expiration period 
we evaluate the recoverability of our finished inventory in consideration of our expected regulatory timelines and estimated sales volumes 
the fda is expected to respond to our most recent symlin submission by march  in consideration of the age of the inventory and potential future launch dates for symlin  we have provided for a valuation reserve of million at december  related to our finished symlin inventory 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
differences between actual clinical trial costs from estimated clinical trial costs have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets relating primarily to net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credits 
subject to certain limitations  these deferred tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods 
since we have been unprofitable since inception and the likelihood of future profitability is not assured  we have fully reserved for these deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
if we determine that we are able to realize a portion or all of these deferred tax assets in the future  we will record an adjustment to increase their recorded value and a corresponding adjustment to increase income in that same period 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r share based payment  which requires stock based compensation for an award of equity instruments  including stock options and employee stock purchase rights  issued to employees to be recognized as a cost in the financial statements 
the cost of these awards are measured according to the grant date fair value of the stock options and is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
in the absence of an observable market price for the stock awards  the grant date fair value of the stock options would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the option  the expected term of the option  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
the requirements of sfas r are effective for us in the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this standard is expected to increase operating expenses and we are currently evaluating the extent of this impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in us government securities  asset backed securities and debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations with strong credit ratings 
these instruments have various short term maturities 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments held are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive investments 
our debt is not subject to significant swings in valuation as interest rates on our debt are fixed 
at december   the fair value of our notes and notes were million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
