client employees acquired in the epix acquisition and the teamstaff acquisition were provided medical care benefits under the medical benefit plans in which they participated on the date of the respective acquisition through september  these plans were fixed cost contracts that capped the company s annual liability 
on october   these employees were provided coverage through the company s ongoing plans 
other health benefit plans the company s dental plans  which include both a ppo and hmo offering  are primarily provided by aetna for all client employees who elect coverage 
delta dental and american dental provided dental coverage for certain client employees acquired in the epix and teamstaff acquisitions through september  all dental plans are subject to guaranteed cost contracts that cap the company s annual liability

k plans the company offers to clients served under the co employment model a k retirement plan  designed to be a multiple employer plan under section c of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
this plan design enables owners of client companies and highly compensated client employees  as well as highly compensated internal employees of the company  to participate 
these persons were previously excluded from the single employer k retirement plan offered by the company prior to april   in order to avoid issues of discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees 
generally  employee benefit plans are subject to provisions of both the code and the employee retirement income security act erisa 
in connection with the epix and teamstaff acquisitions  the company assumed certain employee benefit plans  including two multiple employer k plans 
internal company employees as of december   the company employed internal employees of whom were located at the company s headquarters in bradenton  florida 
the remaining employees were located in the company s branch offices 
none of the company s internal employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

table of contents industry regulation general numerous federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment matters  benefit plans and employment taxes affect the operations of the company or specifically address issues associated with co employment 
many of these federal and state laws were enacted before the development of non traditional employment relationships  such as professional employer organizations  temporary employment and other employment related outsourcing arrangements and  therefore  do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of a professional employer organization 
other federal and state laws and regulations are relatively new  and administrative agencies and federal and state courts have not yet interpreted or applied these regulations to the company s business or its industry 
the development of additional regulations and interpretation of those regulations can be expected to evolve over time 
in addition  from time to time  states have considered  and may in the future consider  imposing certain taxes on gross revenues or service fees of the company and its competitors 
twenty five states  including eight states where the company has offices colorado  florida  minnesota  new jersey  new york  north carolina  texas and tennessee  have passed laws that have licensing  registration or other regulatory requirements for professional employer organizations  and several other states are currently considering similar regulation 
such laws vary from state to state  but generally codify the requirements that a professional employer organization must reserve the right to hire  terminate and discipline client employees and secure workers compensation insurance coverage 
in certain instances  the company delegates or assigns such rights to the client 
the laws also generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of professional employer organizations and  in many cases  the licensure of the controlling officers of the professional employer organization 
in addition  some states through legislative or other regulatory action have proposed to modify the manner in which the company is allowed to provide services to the its clients which could increase the administrative cost associated with providing such services 
to the extent modifications are adopted in these states  other states may follow 
for example  california is considering modifying the interpretation of the law that governs workers compensation insurance coverage to require insurance carriers to issue policies directly to the company s clients rather than through the company under a single master policy 
adoption of this interpretation would increase the company s administrative expense in providing workers compensation coverage to its clients 
the company believes that its operations are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal and state statutes and regulations 
k plans in order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the code  k plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees 
generally  an entity is an employer of certain workers for federal employment tax purposes if an employment relationship exists between the entity and the workers under the common law test of employment 
in addition  the officers of a corporation are deemed to be employees of that corporation for federal employment tax purposes 
the common law test of employment  as applied by the irs  involves an examination of many factors to ascertain whether an employment relationship exists between a worker and a purported employer 
such a test is generally applied to determine whether an individual is an independent contractor or an employee for federal employment tax purposes and not to determine whether each of two or more companies is a co employer 
substantial weight is typically given to the question of whether the purported employer directs and controls the details of an individual s work 
the courts have provided that the common law employer test applied to determine the existence of an employer employee relationship for federal employment tax purposes can be different than the common law test applied to determine employer status for other federal tax purposes 
in addition  control and supervision have been held to be less important factors when determining employer status for erisa purposes 

table of contents on may   the irs released guidance applicable solely to the tax qualified status of defined contribution retirement plans maintained by professional employer organizations 
in that guidance  the irs declared that it would not assert a violation of the exclusive benefit rule under section a of the code if a professional employer organization that maintains a single employer k retirement plan for client employees takes certain remedial action by the last day of the first plan year beginning on or after january  the company maintains a frozen single employer k retirement plan benefiting certain client employees and took remedial action to qualify for the relief provided under the irs guidance within the applicable deadline 
as part of the remedial action  the plan was terminated 
the company has submitted an application to request irs approval to proceed with the plan termination and distribution of assets approximately million as of december  
in conjunction with the epix acquisition  the company assumed sponsorship of a frozen single employer plan 
prior to the acquisition  epix took remedial action to qualify for the relief provided under the irs guidance 
the plan was terminated prior to the applicable deadline and an application was submitted to the irs to request approval to proceed with the plan termination and distribution of assets approximately million at december  
the status of the active multiple employer k retirement plans maintained by the company are unaffected by the irs guidance 
erisa requirements employee pension and welfare benefit plans are also governed by erisa 
erisa defines an employer as any person acting directly as an employer  or indirectly in the interest of an employer  in relation to an employee benefit plan 
erisa defines the term employee as any individual employed by an employer 
the courts have held that the common law test of employment must be applied to determine whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor under erisa 
however  in applying that test  control and supervision are less important for erisa purposes when determining whether an employer has assumed responsibility for an individual s benefits status 
a definitive judicial interpretation of employer in the context of a professional employer organization or employee leasing arrangement has not been established 
if the company were found not to be an employer for erisa purposes  its former k retirement plan would not comply with erisa 
further  the company would be subject to liabilities  including penalties  with respect to its cafeteria benefits plan for failure to withhold and pay taxes applicable to salary deferral contributions by its clients employees 
in addition  as a result of such a finding  the company and its plans would not enjoy  with respect to client employees  the preemption of state laws provided by erisa and could be subject to varying state laws and regulation  as well as to claims based upon state common laws 
federal employment taxes as a co employer  the company assumes responsibility and liability for the payment of federal and state employment taxes with respect to wages and salaries paid to client employees 
there are essentially three types of federal employment tax obligations i withholding of income tax governed by code section  et seq  ii obligations under fica  governed by code section  et seq  and iii obligations under futa  governed by code section  et seq 
under these code sections  employers have the obligation to withhold and remit the employer portion and  where applicable  the employee portion of these taxes 
among other employment tax issues related to whether professional employer organizations are employers of client employees are issues under the code provisions applicable to federal employment taxes 
the issue arises as to whether the company is responsible for payment of employment taxes on wages and salaries paid to such client employees 
code section d  which applies to federal income tax withholding requirements  contains an exception to the general common law test applied to determine whether an entity is an employer for purposes of federal income tax withholding 
the courts have extended this common law employer exception to apply for both fica and futa tax purposes 
code section d 
table of contents states that if the person for whom services are rendered does not have control of the payment of wages  the employer for this purpose is the person having control of the payment of wages 
the treasury regulations issued under code section d state that a third party can be deemed to be the employer of workers under this section for income tax withholding purposes where the person for whom services are rendered does not have legal control of the payment of wages 
although several courts have examined code section d with regard to professional employer organizations  its ultimate scope has not been delineated 
moreover  the irs has  to date  relied extensively on the common law test of employment in determining liability for failure to comply with federal income tax withholding requirements 
accordingly  while the company believes that it can assume the withholding obligations for client employees  if the company fails to meet these obligations  the client may be held jointly and severally liable 
while this interpretive issue has not  to the company s knowledge  discouraged clients from utilizing the company s services  there can be no assurance that a definitive adverse resolution of this issue would not do so in the future 
significant transactions in epix acquisition on march   the company acquired the human resource outsourcing client portfolio of epix and certain of its subsidiaries

the company believes that the human resource outsourcing market focusing on small and medium sized businesses  as measured by the number of employees per client  is by far its most attractive market in terms of customer concentration  need for customized solutions  price sensitivity  capital investment  new client acquisition cost  sales cycle and market growth 
the company believes that the human resource outsourcing competitive landscape is highly fragmented and populated by various point solution providers who offer only segments of the entire service offering that the company provides to its clients 
the company focuses on the professional service fees that it earns from its clients as the primary source of its net income and cash flow 
when delivering its human resource outsourcing solution to its clients through 
table of contents a co employment relationship  the company is also responsible for providing workers compensation and unemployment insurance benefits to its client s employees as well as health and welfare benefits 
in so doing  the company has an opportunity to generate net income and cash but does not believe that this should be a significant portion of its long term overall business profitability 
the company believes that the primary challenge and risk it faces in delivering its human resource outsourcing solutions is its ability to convince small and medium sized business to accept the concept of human resource outsourcing 
the company believes that most small and medium sized businesses outsource certain aspects of the company s total solution  including payroll administration  health and welfare administration and providing workers compensation insurance  but that only a small number of businesses outsource the entire offering that the company provides 
the company has transitioned its business from one that provided low cost insurance offerings and payroll processing services to its clients to one that delivers a comprehensive  fully integrated employee management solution to its clients 
as a result  the company increased its profitability by focusing on increased profitability per client employee 
during this transition  the total number of client employees serviced by the company declined from over  client employees in to under  client employees during following the acquisitions of epix in and teamstaff in  the company serviced approximately  client employees as of december  the company continues to focus on increasing the profitability of each client employee as well as on increasing the overall number of client employees serviced 
the company believes that it can increase the overall number of client employees serviced through i the enlargement of its target market focus to client prospects having employees  ii the reconfiguration of sales territories to fewer territories that are larger in size  iii improved human resource outsourcing service offerings that will lead to higher current client employee retention levels  and iv acquisitions of other human resource outsourcing client portfolios 
the company has announced a long range strategic objective of providing its range of insourced human resource services to its clients without the risk associated with providing workers compensation and healthcare insurance programs to its clients 
the company expects to evolve toward a business model that does not require the co employment relationship but allows clients to retain their own insurance programs  which the company will administer 
to date  the results of this new business model have not had a significant impact on the company s revenues or results of operations 

table of contents the following table provides information that the company utilizes when assessing the financial performance of its business and which include the effects of the teamstaff acquisition in november and the epix acquisition in march for the years ended december  change statistical data client employees at period end clients at period end average number of client employees at period end clients at period end average number of client employees paid by month average wage per average number of client employees paid by month professional service fees per average number of client employees paid by month gross profit per average number of client employees paid by month operating expense excluding depreciation and amortization per average number of client employees paid by month operating income per average number of client employees paid by month clients measured by individual client fein 
the average number of client employees paid by month is calculated based upon the sum of the number of paid client employees at the end of each month in the year divided by months 
all other statistical information above is based upon actual year to date amounts divided by the average number of client employees paid by month 
the company believes that the primary risks to its ability to increase the overall number of client employees serviced are i the amount of time required for sales personnel to begin to acquire new client employees may be longer than anticipated  ii the current client employee retention levels may decrease if clients decide to use alternative providers to service their human resource outsourcing needs  iii other human resource outsourcing client employee portfolios may not be available for acquisition due to price or quality of the portfolios  iv the company under its co employed service option may not be able to continue to provide insurance related products of a quality to acquire new client employees and to retain current client employees  v the time to achieve acceptance by prospective clients of the company s new business model may be longer than anticipated and vi the inexperience of much of its sales force 
acquisitions epix acquisition 
on march   the company acquired the human resource outsourcing client portfolio of epix and certain of its subsidiaries 
the transaction was accomplished by an assignment from epix and its subsidiaries to the company of all of its client service agreements  which covered approximately  clients and approximately  client employees 
see further information at item business significant transactions in and note to the consolidated financial statements 
teamstaff acquisition 
on november   the company acquired the human resource outsourcing client portfolio of teamstaff  inc together with certain other assets 
the teamstaff acquisition was accomplished through an assignment by teamstaff and its subsidiaries to the company of all of its client service agreements  which covered approximately  clients and approximately  client employees 
see further information in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenues the gross billings that the company charges its clients under its professional services agreement include each client employee s gross wages  a consolidated service fee and  to the extent elected by the clients  health and welfare benefit plan costs 
the company s consolidated service fee  which is primarily computed on a percentage of payroll basis  is intended to yield a profit to the company and to cover the costs of the human resource outsourcing services provided by the company to the client  certain employment related taxes and workers compensation insurance coverage 
the professional service fee component of the consolidated service fee related to human resource outsourcing varies according to a number of factors  such as the size and the location of the client 
the component of the consolidated service fee related to workers compensation and unemployment insurance is based  in part  on the client s historical claims experience 
all charges by the company are invoiced along with each periodic payroll provided to the client 
the company s long term profitability is largely dependent upon the company s success in generating professional service fees by providing value to its clients 
the company accounts for its revenues using the accrual method of accounting 
under the accrual method of accounting  the company recognizes its revenues in the period in which the client employee performs work 
the company accrues revenues and unbilled receivables for consolidated service fees relating to work performed by client employees but unpaid at the end of each period 
in addition  the related costs of services are accrued as a liability for the same period 
subsequent to the end of each period  such wages are paid and the related service fees are billed 
the company reports revenues from consolidated service fees in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent

the accounting estimates described below are those that the company considers critical in preparing its financial statements because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
while management has used its best estimates based upon facts and circumstances available at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  and changes in the accounting estimates used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management periodically reviews the estimates and assumptions and reflects the effects of revisions in the period they are determined to be necessary 
management has reviewed the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors

workers compensation claim payments related to an individual policy year may extend over many years following the date of the worksite injury 
volatility in the dollar amount of workers compensation costs arises when the number of accidents and the severity of such accidents cannot be easily projected  thus resulting in a wide range of possible expected dollar losses for an insurance policy year 
such volatility in the projection of expected dollar losses caused by the number of claims and the severity of such claims is more likely to be associated with industries that have a high risk level associated with them 
at least annually  the company obtains an independent actuarially determined calculation of the estimated costs of claims incurred based on the company s current and historical loss development trends  which is used in the company s development of overall loss estimates related to each open policy year 
the estimated costs of the claims calculated may be revised each year by the company and its independent actuary based on developments relating to the actual claims incurred and other factors deemed relevant by the 
table of contents company and its actuary 
a significant amount of judgment is used in this estimation process by both the independent actuary and the company

if the actual cost of the claims incurred is higher than the estimates determined by the company and its independent actuary  then the accrual rate used to determine workers compensation costs could increase 
if the actual cost of the claims incurred is lower than the estimates determined by the company and its independent actuary  then the accrual rate used to determine workers compensation costs could decrease 
such increase or decrease to the accrual rate is reflected in the accounting period for which the change in the amount of workers compensation claims is estimated 
due to the considerable variability in the estimate of the amount of workers compensation claims  adjustments to workers compensation costs are sometimes significant 
for example  a change in overall claims loss estimate for claims under the million deductible level with no other changes in assumptions would have impacted the net present value of the claims liability and workers compensation cost as of december  by approximately million 
the workers compensation receivable payable is also affected by the change in the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the remaining claim liability 
fluctuations in the interest rate environment influence the selection of the discount rate 
increases in the discount rate result in a decrease in the net present value of the liability while decreases in the discount rate result in an increase in the net present value of the liability 
for example a change in the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of the claims liability at december  with no other changes in assumptions would have impacted the net present value of the claims liability and workers compensation cost as of december  by approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company  in conjunction with its annual actuarial calculation of estimated costs of claims  further revised its previous loss estimates for program years in recognition of the continued favorable claims maturation trends  which resulted in a million favorable adjustment million net of tax to costs of services and workers compensation receivable 

table of contents the following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for workers compensation claims for each of the open policy years 
this table excludes the program year for the texas workers compensation insurance fund  which was a guaranteed cost program under which all of the claims were paid by the insurance company without any deductible payment by the company 
the second section  reading down  shows the number of claims reported 
the third section  reading down  shows the number of open claims as of the end of each successive year 
the fourth section  reading down  shows the amount of open case reserves as of the end of each successive year 
the fifth section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability 
the last section  reading down  shows re estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the end of each successive year  which is the result of the company s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the loss reserve development table for workers compensation claims is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior plan years 
years ended december  dollars in thousands originally reported reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses limited to million per occurrence number of claims reported as of end of initial year one year later two years later three years later four years later number of open claims reported as of end of initial year one year later two years later three years later four years later insurance carrier open case reserve amount as of end of initial year one year later two years later three years later four years later 
table of contents years ended december  dollars in thousands cumulative net paid claims by insurance carrier as of end of initial year one year later two years later three years later four years later undiscounted reserves reestimated as of end of initial year one year later two years later three years later four years later the following table summarizes the expected undiscounted cash flows related to workers compensation claims payments for the open policy years as of december  policy years through have been combined to reflect the additional insurance coverage purchased from aig during with respect to these policy years for the policy years ended december  in thousands actual premium collateral payments to carriers paid claims by insurance carrier estimated future claims covered by premium collateral total estimated ultimate claims estimated interest on premium collateral payments earned through december  estimated return of premium collateral undiscounted the aig workers compensation insurance program provides for a return to the company of excess premiums paid eighteen months after the beginning of each policy year and annually thereafter 
such adjustment amount is determined by applying a loss development factor to an estimate of the incurred losses based upon actual claims incurred during the policy year and comparing such amount to actual premiums paid for the policy year 
the company expects to receive approximately million of returned premium during the third quarter of relative to the aig policy years and all other estimated premium collateral return is expected to be long term 
the first return  if any  from aig for the policy relating to the  and program years will occur june  intangible assets the company has recorded significant intangible assets as a result of the epix and teamstaff acquisitions 
the intangible assets related to the client service agreements acquired were valued by a third party  considered to have a finite life  and are being amortized over a year period based upon the estimated rate of client attrition 
the original estimate of client attrition was based upon the previous experience of the company 
the company reviews the remaining life of the intangible assets periodically and reviews for impairment if events and circumstances warrant 
changes to the estimated useful life  if any  may result in an increase in amortization expense that may be significant 

table of contents medical benefit plan liabilities the company provides medical benefit plans to its client employees through several medical benefits plan providers under a minimum premium plan with bcbsfl  a retrospective premium plan with aetna for the aetna ppo plan and guarantee cost contracts for all other plans 
with respect to the medical benefit plans with bcbsfl  the company establishes medical benefit plan liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these reserves and the related health benefit plan subsidy are developed on an annual basis by an independent actuary using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including paid claims  claim development factors  plan enrollment  medical trend and the potential variability margin in these factors 
the aetna ppo medical benefit plan is a retrospective funding arrangement under which the plan is subject to additional premium if actual claims are greater than projected at the inception of the policy year 
the maximum recall percentage in any one year is 
amounts above  if any  are subject to carryforward into future policy years 
for each period  the company estimates the relevant factors  based primarily on historical data and uses this information to determine the assumptions underlying the reserve calculations 
an extensive degree of judgment is used in this estimation process 
due to the considerable variability of health care costs  adjustments to health reserves are sometimes significant 
for example  an increase decrease in the margin factor used to calculate claims incurred but not reported by at december  would have resulted in an increase decrease in the incurred but not reported claim reserve of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company  in conjunction with its annual actuarial calculation of incurred but not reported claims  recorded a favorable adjustment of million million net of tax which reduced its cost of services and reserves for incurred but not reported claims 
the following table provides the amount of the medical benefit plan liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported in thousands year ended december  incurred but not reported claims other health plan liabilities payable total medical benefit plan liabilities if the actual amount of the company s medical benefit plan liabilities at the end of each period were to increase decrease from the estimates used by the company  then the company would have an increase in the amount of its future period health benefit subsidy surplus 
the company s financial statements reflect the estimates made within the cost of services on the company s consolidated statement of operations and within the accrued insurance premiums  health and workers compensation reserves on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
state unemployment taxes the company records state unemployment tax expense based upon taxable wages and tax rates as determined by each state 
state unemployment rates vary by state and are based  in part  on past claim experience 
if the company s claim experience increases  its rates could increase 
additionally  states have the ability to increase unemployment tax rates to cover deficiencies in the state s unemployment tax fund 
as a result our unemployment tax rates have increased over the last several years and are expected to continue to increase 
some states have implemented retroactive rate increases 
such increases cannot always be predicted 
contractual arrangements with the company s clients may limit its ability to pass through such rate increases and have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its clients to pay their fees 
the company believes that the success of its business is heavily dependent on its ability to collect these fees for several reasons including the following the fact that the company is at risk for the payment of its direct costs and client employee payroll costs regardless of whether the clients pay their fees  the large volume and dollar amount of transactions processed by the company  and the periodic and recurring nature of payroll  upon which the fees are based 
the company has established very tight credit policies and generally requires its clients to pay in advance or simultaneously with the delivery of its payroll 
in addition  the company maintains the right to terminate the professional services agreement and associated client employees or to require prepayment  letters of credit or other collateral upon deterioration of a client s financial position or upon nonpayment by a client 
as a result of the company s strict credit policies  customer nonpayments have been historically low as a percentage of revenues 
if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate rapidly  resulting in non payment  the company s uncollected accounts receivable could increase rapidly and the company could be required to provide for additional allowances 
deferred taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and  if necessary  establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if the company were to operate at a loss or is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  then the company could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  resulting in a substantial increase in the company s effective tax rate 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
the company currently uses the black scholes option pricing model to value its options and is currently assessing which model to use in the future under the statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under employee stock purchase plans 
in addition to the determination of the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the company will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the allowed transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption alternatives 
under the retroactive methods  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all 
table of contents periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the effective date of the new standard is the company s third quarter in the company is evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r and the company expects that the adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share base payments granted in the future 
the company will be required to expense the fair value of its stock option grants and stock purchases under its employee stock purchase plan rather than the current practice of disclosure of the impact on its consolidated net income within the footnotes 
the amounts disclosed within the company s footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
compensation expense calculated under sfas no 
r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within the company s footnotes based on changes in the fair value of its common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors 
in addition  upon adoption of sfas no 
r the company may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options
