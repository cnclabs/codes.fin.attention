strategic partnerships establishing partnerships and alliances with third parties that provide additional services and resources for implementing our solutions to enhance our sales and service organizations productivity is an important element of our strategy 
these relationships and alliances fall into the following categories consulting and system integration relationships 
to enhance the productivity of our sales and service organizations  we have established relationships with systems integrators  complementary technology providers 
table of contents and alternative service providers 
we have established relationships and trained professionals at a number of systems integrators including accenture  capgemini  ibm global services  ness technologies and infogain 
we plan to expand these relationships to increase our capacity to license and implement our products 
we have trained consultants in these organizations for the implementation and support of our solutions 
we believe that expanding our relationships with systems integrators and independent consulting firms will enable us to gain a greater share of our target markets 
technology partnerships 
we make extensive use of industry platforms and embrace a number of core technologies in our solution offerings 
we have formed partnerships with vendors of software and hardware technology platforms 
we currently maintain technology relationships with vendors such as avaya lucent  alcatel genesys  bea systems  cisco systems  ibm  oracle  isban and sun microsystems 
many of these companies voluntarily provide us with early releases of new technology platforms  education related to those platforms and limited access to their technical resources to facilitate adoption of their technology 
competition the market for our products is competitive  rapidly evolving  and can be affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
the competitive landscape is quickly evolving to address the need for enterprise wide integration of it assets and the convergence of customer interaction applications  back office systems and business processes 
the most significant competition we face is from customers internal development efforts  custom system integration  as well as other software providers that offer integration and development platforms 
internal development many of our customers and potential customers have in the past attempted to develop customer service  call center and customer relationship management systems in house or with the help of systems integrators 
internal information technology departments have staffed projects to build their own systems utilizing a variety of tools 
the cost of internal development and total cost of ownership has risen to become a primary concern of the business and management 
we expect that internal development will continue to be a significant source of competition 
custom system integration projects another source of competition results from systems integrators engaged to build a custom development application 
the competitive factors in this area require that we demonstrate to the customer the cost savings and advantages of configurable  upgradeable and commercially supported software products developed by a dedicated professional software organization 
we frequently rely on system consulting and systems integration firms for implementation and other global services  as well as recommendations of our products during the evaluation stage of the purchase process 
many of these third parties have similar and often more established relationships with our competitors 
we cannot assure that these third parties  many of whom have significantly greater resources than us  will not market software products in competition with us 
application software competitors our primary competition is from internal development at our customers and potential customers as discussed 
however  other competitors include providers of traditional  first generation customer relationship management  enterprise resources planning  call center  marketing automation software and sales force automation software 
these vendors include  among others  companies such as peoplesoft  inc acquired by oracle corporation  e 
piphany  inc acquired by ssa global technologies  fidelity systems  s corporation  amdocs  and siebel systems  inc  which has signed an agreement to be acquired by oracle corporation 

table of contents some of these companies have longer operating histories  greater financial  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition in other markets and a larger base of customers than we do 
in addition  some companies have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
as a result  these competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
we believe that we compete favorably in the industries we serve based on the following competitive advantages process driven solutions for servicing and selling  real time and transactional processes  real time decision management and vertical processes implemented in a multichannel architecture 
the technology advantages are equally important to our customers and include chordiant jx architecture providing an open services oriented architecture providing for integration with multiple legacy systems  third party applications and communication channels and advanced browser based application environment for high volume call center  mid office and branch operations 
there is no one competitor  nor are there a small number of competitors that are dominant in our market 
there are many factors that may increase competition in the enterprise customer relationship management market  including i entry of new competitors  ii mergers and alliances among existing competitors  iii consolidation in the software industry and iv technological changes or changes in the use of the internet 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressure faced by us will not materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
intellectual property and proprietary rights our success is in part dependent upon our ability to develop and protect proprietary technology and intellectual proprietary rights 
we rely primarily on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures  patents pending  trade secrets  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we license our products through non exclusive license agreements that impose restrictions on customers ability to utilize the software 
in addition  we seek to avoid disclosure of our trade secrets  including requiring employees  customers and others with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and restricting access to our source code 
we also seek to protect our rights in our products  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
due to rapid technological change  we believe factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments and enhancements to our existing products are more important than the various legal protections of our technology to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we integrate third party software into our products 
costs associated with integrated technology provided by third parties historically accounts for approximately to of total license revenues 
the third party software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we cannot maintain licenses to key third party software  shipments of our products could be delayed until equivalent software is developed or licensed and integrated into our products 
moreover  although we are generally indemnified against claims if technology licensed from third parties infringes the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others  this indemnification is not always available for all types of intellectual property and proprietary rights and in some cases the scope of this indemnification is limited 
there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims arising from the incorporation of third party technology or claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from these claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources  in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays 

table of contents despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing laws afford only limited protection 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use 
use by others of our proprietary rights could materially harm our business 
furthermore  policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
it is also possible that third parties will claim that we have infringed their current or future products 
we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products in different industry segments overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  prevent product shipment  cause delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could harm our business 
patent litigation in particular has complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties 
if an infringement claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology or redesign to avoid infringement  our business would be harmed 
employees as of september   we employed full time employees 
of that total  were primarily engaged in product development  engineering or systems engineering  were engaged in sales and marketing  were engaged in professional services and were engaged in operational  financial and administrative functions 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
we believe our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to recruit and retain highly skilled technical  finance  management and marketing personnel 
financial information about geographic areas for a detailed description of our sales by geographic region  we incorporate by reference the information in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
for information relating to the risks attendant to our foreign operations  we incorporate by reference the information under the headings risk factors if we fail to adequately address the difficulties of managing our international operations  our revenues and operating expenses will be adversely affected and risk factors fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets and could negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 
available information we were incorporated in california in march and were reincorporated in delaware in october we maintain a site on the world wide web at www

we make available free of charge on or through our website our filings with the securities and exchange commission  including our annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section a or d of the securities exchange act  as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with  or furnish it to  the securities and exchange commission 

table of contents item a 
risk factors historically  we have not been profitable and we may continue to incur losses  which may raise vendor viability concerns thereby making it more difficult to close license transactions with new and existing customers 
we incurred losses of million for the year ended september  we incurred losses of million for the nine months ended september  we incurred losses of million for the year ended december  as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may continue to incur losses and cannot be certain that we can achieve or generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
continued losses may leave many customers reluctant to enter into new large value license transactions without some assurance that we will operate profitably 
if we fail to enter into new large value license transactions due to lack of vendor profitability and or viability concerns  our revenues will decline  which would further adversely affect our operating results 
because a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our revenues  the loss of a significant customer could cause a substantial decline in our revenues 
we derive a significant portion of our license and service revenues from a limited number of customers 
the loss of a major customer could cause a decrease in revenues and net income 
for the year ended september   capital one accounted for of our total revenues 
for the nine months ended september   barclays  time warner cable  and the canadian imperial bank of commerce accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively 
while our customer concentration has fluctuated  we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
as a result  if we lose a major customer  or if a contract is delayed or cancelled or we do not contract with new major customers  our revenues and net loss would be adversely affected 
in addition  customers that have accounted for significant revenues in the past may not generate revenues in any future period  causing our failure to obtain new significant customers or additional orders from existing customers to materially affect our operating results 
if we fail to adequately address the difficulties of managing our international operations  our revenues and operating expenses will be adversely affected 
for the year ended september   international revenues were million or approximately of our total revenues 
for the nine months ended september   international revenues were million or approximately of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   international revenues were million or approximately of our total revenues 
while we expect north american revenues to increase as a percentage of our overall revenues  international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
we have faced  and will continue to face  difficulties in managing international operations which include difficulties in hiring qualified local personnel  seasonal fluctuations in customer orders  longer accounts receivable collection cycles  expenses associated with licensing products and servicing customers in foreign markets  and economic downturns and political uncertainty in international economies 
expectations of european economic growth that are lower than for the us 
any of these factors could have a significant impact on our ability to license products on a competitive and timely basis and could adversely affect our operating expenses and net income 

table of contents product backlog an increasingly material portion of our revenues has been derived from large orders  as major customers deployed our products 
we define backlog as non cancelable contractual commitments by our customers through purchase orders or contracts 
backlog is comprised of current software license orders which have not been accepted by customers or have not otherwise met all of the required criteria for revenue recognition  deferred revenue from customer support contracts  and deferred consulting and education orders for services not yet completed or delivered 
backlog is not necessarily indicative of revenues to be recognized in a specified future period 
there are many factors that would impact chordiant s filling of backlog  such as chordiant s progress in completing projects for its customers and chordiant s customers meeting anticipated schedules for customer dependent deliverables 
chordiant provides no assurances that any portion of its backlog will be filled during any fiscal year or at all or that its backlog will be recognized as revenues in any given period 
in addition  it is possible that customers from whom we expect to derive revenue from backlog will default and as a result we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets and could negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 
a significant portion of our sales and operating expenses result from transactions outside of the united states  often in foreign currencies 
these currencies include the united kingdom pound sterling  the euro and canadian dollars 
our international sales comprised of our total sales for the year ended september  our international sales comprised of our total sales for the nine months ended september  our international sales comprised of our total sales for the year ended december  our future operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates  especially if international sales grow as a percentage of our total sales  and we may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future 
for the year ended september   we had a foreign currency translation loss of approximately million 
we do not engage in any currency hedging activities 
geopolitical concerns could make the closing of license transactions with new and existing customers difficult 
our revenues will decrease in fiscal year if we are unable to enter into new large scale license transactions with new and existing customers 
the current state of world affairs and geopolitical concerns have left many customers reluctant to enter into new large value license transactions without some assurance that the economy both in the customer s home country and worldwide will have some economic and political stability 
geopolitical instability will continue to make closing large license transactions difficult 
in addition  we cannot predict what effect the us military presence overseas or potential or actual political or military conflict have had or are continuing to have on our existing and prospective customers decision making process with respect to licensing or implementing enterprise level products such as ours 
our ability to enter into new large license transactions also directly affects our ability to create additional consulting services and maintenance revenues  on which we also depend 
competition in our markets is intense and could reduce our sales and prevent us from achieving profitability 
increased competition in our markets could result in price reductions for our products and services  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could reduce our future revenues 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
historically  our primary competition has been from internal development  custom systems integration projects and application software competitors 
in particular  we compete with internal information technology departments in house information technology departments of potential customers have developed or may develop systems that provide some or all of the functionality of our products 
we expect that internally developed application integration and process automation efforts will continue to be a significant source of competition 

table of contents custom systems integration projects we compete with large systems integrators who may develop custom solutions for specific companies which may reduce the likelihood that they would purchase our products and services 
point application vendors we compete with providers of stand alone point solutions for web based customer relationship management and traditional client server based  call center service customer and sales force automation solution providers 
in addition  recent consolidation in the software industry may indicate that we will face new competitors in the future 
in august  oracle announced that it will acquire a majority interest in i flex solutions  a banking software maker headquartered in mumbai  india 
in august  ibm announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire dwl  a provider of middleware to companies in the banking  insurance  retail and telecommunications industries 
in august  ssa global technologies announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire e 
piphany  inc  a maker of customer relationship management software products 
in september  oracle announced that it signed an agreement to acquire siebel systems  inc  a maker of customer relationship management software products 
while we do not believe that either i flex or dwl have been significant competitors of chordiant in the past  the acquisition of these companies by oracle and ibm may indicate that we will face increased competition from significantly larger and more established entities in the future 
many of our competitors have greater resources and broader customer relationships than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors have extensive knowledge of our industry 
current and potential competitors have established  or may establish  cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to offer a single solution and to increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
we may experience a shortfall in revenue  earnings  cash flow or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of these factors include size and timing of individual license transactions  delay or deferral of customer implementations of our products and subsequent impact on revenues  lengthening of our sales cycle  potential additional deterioration and changes in domestic and foreign markets and economies  success in expanding our global services organization  direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  timing of new product introductions and product enhancements  appropriate mix of products licensed and services sold  levels of international transactions  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  product and price competition  and our ability to develop and market new products and control costs 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high during any given period or may cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
based upon the preceding factors  we may experience a shortfall in revenues and earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

table of contents our operating results fluctuate significantly and delays in implementation of our products may cause unanticipated declines in revenues or cash flow  which could disappoint investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly revenues depend primarily upon product implementation by our customers 
we have historically recognized a significant portion of our license and services revenue through the percentage of completion method  using labor hours incurred as the measure of progress towards completion of implementation of our products and we expect this practice to continue 
the percentage of completion accounting method requires ongoing estimates of progress of complicated and frequently changing technology projects 
documenting the measure of progress towards completion of implementation is subject to potential errors and changes in estimates 
as a result  even minor errors or minor changes in estimates may lead to significant changes in accounting results which may be revised in later quarters due to subsequent information and events 
thus  delays or changes in customer business goals or direction when implementing our software may negatively impact our quarterly revenue 
in addition  a significant portion of new customer orders have been booked in the third month of the calendar quarter  with many of these bookings occurring in the last two weeks of the third month 
we expect this trend to continue and  therefore  any failure or delay in bookings would decrease our quarterly revenue 
if our revenues or operating margins are below the expectations of the investment community  our stock price is likely to decline 
if we fail to maintain and expand our relationships with systems integrators and other business partners  our ability to develop  market  sell  and support our products may be adversely affected 
our development  marketing and distribution strategies rely on our ability to form and maintain long term strategic relationships with systems integrators  in particular  our existing business alliance partners  ibm and accenture 
these business relationships often consist of joint marketing programs  technology partnerships and resale and distribution arrangements 
although most aspects of these relationships are contractual in nature  many important aspects of these relationships depend on the continued cooperation between the parties 
divergence in strategy  change in focus  competitive product offerings or potential contract defaults may interfere with our ability to develop  market  sell  or support our products  which in turn could harm our business 
if either ibm or accenture were to terminate their agreements with us or our relationship were to deteriorate  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in many cases  these parties have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and influence the decisions of these customers 
a number of our competitors have stronger relationships with ibm and accenture and  as a result  these systems integrators may be more likely to recommend competitors products and services 
in addition  in august  ibm announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire dwl  a provider of middleware to companies in the banking  insurance  retail and telecommunications industries 
while we do not believe that dwl has been a direct competitor of chordiant in the past  ibm s acquisition of dwl may indicate that ibm will become a competitor of ours in the future 
if systems integrators fail to properly implement our software  our business  reputation and financial results may be harmed 
we are increasingly relying on systems integrators to implement our products  and this trend may continue 
as a result  we have less quality control over the implementation of our software with respect to these transactions and are more reliant on the ability of our systems integrators to correctly implement our software 
if these systems integrators fail to properly implement our software  our business  reputation and financial results may be harmed 
our primary products have a long sales and implementation cycle  which makes it difficult to predict our quarterly results and may cause our operating results to vary significantly 
the period between initial contact with a prospective customer and the implementation of our products is unpredictable and often lengthy  ranging to date from three to twenty four months 
thus  revenue and cash 
table of contents receipts could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
any delays in the implementation of our products could cause reductions in our revenues 
the licensing of our products is often an enterprise wide decision that generally requires us to provide a significant level of education to prospective customers about the use and benefits of our products 
the implementation of our products involves significant commitment of technical and financial resources and is commonly associated with substantial implementation efforts that may be performed by us  by the customer or by third party systems integrators 
customers generally consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products  including product benefits  ability to operate with existing and future computer systems  vendor financial stability and longevity  ability to accommodate increased transaction volume and product reliability 
if we do not successfully implement our plan to improve our internal control over financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting and customers may delay purchasing decisions  which would harm our business and the market price of our common stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports  our business could be harmed 
we are a complex company with complex accounting issues and thus subject to related risks of errors in financial reporting which may cause problems in corporate governance  the costs of which may outweigh the costs of the underlying errors themselves 
for example  in the course of preparing its financial results for the year ended september   the company and its independent registered public accounting firm  bdo seidman  llp  identified certain errors in the company s interim financial statements for the quarters ended december   march   and june  and management concluded that as a result of these errors  the company should restate the company s interim financial statements for these quarters 
these errors are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
as a result of this need to restate interim financial statements  management and the audit committee determined that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed 
these material weaknesses have contributed to increased expenses and efforts required for our financial reporting 
if we are not successful in implementing effective internal controls over financial reporting  customers may delay purchasing decisions or we may lose customers  create investor uncertainty  face litigation and the market price of our common stock may decline 
for more information  please refer to the discussion below under the heading item a 
controls and procedures 
if we are not able to successfully manage our partner operations in india  our operations and financial results may be adversely affected 
in fiscal year  we entered into an agreement with an independent contracting company with global technical resources and an operations center in bangalore  india and other locations 
the agreement provides for the independent contractor  at our direction  to attract  train  assimilate and retain sufficient highly qualified personnel to perform staffing for consulting projects  technical support  product test and certain sustaining engineering functions 
as of september   we use the services of approximately persons through our independent contractor 
in addition  as a result of the reduction in our workforce that took place in july  we are now more dependent on this agreement 
the expansion of this organization is an important component of our strategy to address the business needs of our customers and manage our expenses 
the success of this operation will depend on our ability and our independent contractor s ability to attract  train  assimilate and retain highly qualified personnel in the required periods 
a disruption of our relationship with the independent contractor could adversely affect our operations 
failure to effectively manage the organization and operations will harm our business and financial results 
our stock price is subject to significant fluctuations  which may adversely affect the value of your investment in our common stock 
since our initial public offering in february  the price of our common stock has fluctuated widely 
during the year ended september   the price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market ranged from a low of to a high of per share 
we believe that factors such as the risks described herein 
table of contents or other factors could cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
in addition  recently  the stock market in general  and the market for high technology stocks in particular  has experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
such fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may incur  in future periods  significant stock based compensation charges related to certain stock options and stock awards  which may adversely affect our reported financial results 
based on current accounting standards involving stock compensation  we may incur variable accounting costs related to the issuance of restricted stock and certain stock options  including those associated with our stock option cancellation re grant program 
current accounting standards require us to re measure compensation cost for such options each reporting period based on changes in the market value of the underlying common stock 
depending upon movements in the market value of our common stock  the variable accounting treatment of those stock options may result in significant additional stock based compensation costs in future periods 
future accounting standards may have a greater impact 
we are the target of a securities class action complaint and are at risk of securities class action litigation  which may result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources 
beginning in july  chordiant and certain of our officers and directors were named as defendants in several class action shareholder complaints filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  now consolidated under the caption  in re chordiant software  inc initial public offering securities litigation  case no 
cv in the amended complaint  the plaintiffs allege that chordiant  certain of our officers and directors and the underwriters of our initial public offering ipo violated section of the securities act of  as amended  based on allegations that chordiant s registration statement and prospectus failed to disclose material facts regarding the compensation to be received by  and the stock allocation practices of  the ipo underwriters 
the complaint also contains a claim for violation of section b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  based on allegations that this omission constituted a deceit on investors 
the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief 
similar complaints were filed in the same court against hundreds of other public companies that conducted ipos of their common stock in the late s 
in june  chordiant and almost all of the other issuers entered into a formal settlement agreement with the plaintiffs 
on february   the court issued a decision certifying a class action for settlement purposes  and granting preliminary approval of the settlement subject to modification of certain bar orders contemplated by the settlement 
in addition  the settlement is still subject to statutory notice requirements as well as final judicial approval 
if the settlement is not finalized as proposed  then this action may divert the efforts and attention of our management and  if determined adversely to us  could have a material impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
if our products do not operate effectively in a company wide environment  we may lose sales and suffer decreased revenues 
if existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or choose not to fully deploy our products  it could damage our reputation and reduce revenues 
our success requires that our products be highly scalable  and able to accommodate substantial increases in the number of users 
our products are expected to be deployed on a variety of computer software and hardware platforms and to be used in connection with a number of third party software applications by personnel who may not have previously used application software systems or our products 
these deployments present very significant technical challenges  which are difficult or impossible to predict 
if these deployments do not succeed  we may lose future sales opportunities and suffer decreased revenues 
defects in our products could diminish demand for our products and result in decreased revenues  decreased market acceptance and injury to our reputation 
errors may be found from time to time in our new  acquired or enhanced products 
any significant software errors in our products may result in decreased revenues  decreased sales  and injury to our reputation and or 
table of contents increased warranty and repair costs 
although we conduct extensive product testing during product development  we have in the past discovered software errors in our products as well as in third party products  and as a result have experienced delays in the shipment of our new products 
because competition for qualified personnel is intense  we may not be able to retain or recruit personnel  which could impact the development and sales of our products 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel  or if newly hired personnel fail to develop the necessary skills or fail to reach expected levels of productivity  our ability to develop and market our products will be weakened 
our success depends largely on the continued contributions of our key management  finance  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel 
because of the dependency on a small number of large deals  we are uniquely dependent upon the talents and relationships of a few executives and have no guarantee of their retention 
we have been targeted by recruitment agencies seeking to hire our key management  finance  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel 
in addition  in july we reduced the size of our workforce by approximately  which may have a negative effect on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
to date  our sales have been concentrated in the financial services  telecommunications and retail markets  and if we are unable to continue sales in these markets or successfully penetrate new markets  our revenues may decline 
sales of our products and services in three large markets financial services  telecommunications and retail markets accounted for approximately and of our total revenues for the year ended september  and the nine months ended september   respectively 
we expect that revenues from these three markets will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to successfully increase penetration of our existing markets or achieve sales in additional markets  or if the overall economic climate of our target markets deteriorates  our revenues may decline 
low gross margin in services revenues could adversely impact our overall gross margin and income 
our services revenues have had lower gross margins than our license revenues 
service revenues comprised and of our total revenues for the year ended september  and the nine months ended september   respectively 
gross margin on service revenues was and for the year ended september  and the nine months ended september   respectively 
service revenues comprised of our total revenues for the year ended december  and gross margin on service revenues was in that year 
license revenues comprised and of our total revenues for the year ended september  and the nine months ended september   respectively 
license revenues comprised of our total revenues for the year ended december  gross margins on license revenues were and for the year ended september  and the nine months ended september   respectively 
gross margins on license revenues were for the year ended december  as a result  an increase in the percentage of total revenues represented by services revenues  or an unexpected decrease in license revenues  could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins 
to increase services revenues  we would expand our services organization  successfully recruit and train a sufficient number of qualified services personnel  enter into new implementation projects and obtain renewals of current maintenance contracts by our customers 
this expansion could further reduce gross margins in our services revenues 
we may not have the workforce necessary to support our platform of products if demand for our products substantially increased  and  if we need to rebuild our workforce in the future  we may not be able to recruit personnel in a timely manner  which could negatively impact the development and sales of our products 
in july  we reduced the size of our workforce by approximately 
in the event that demand for our products increases  we may need to rebuild our workforce or increase outsourced functions to companies based in foreign jurisdictions and we may be unable to hire  train or retain qualified personnel in a timely manner  which 
table of contents may weaken our ability to market our products in a timely manner  negatively impacting our operations 
our success depends largely on ensuring that we have adequate personnel to support our platform of products as well as the continued contributions of our key management  finance  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel 
if we fail to introduce new versions and releases of functional and scalable products in a timely manner  customers may license competing products and our revenues may decline 
if we are unable to ship or implement enhancements to our products when planned  or fail to achieve timely market acceptance of these enhancements  we may suffer lost sales and could fail to achieve anticipated revenues 
we have in the past  and expect in the future  to derive a significant portion of our total revenues from the license of our primary product suite 
our future operating results will depend on the demand for the product suite by future customers  including new and enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced 
if our competitors release new products that are superior to our products in performance or price  or if we fail to enhance our products or introduce new features and functionality in a timely manner  demand for our products may decline 
we have in the past experienced delays in the planned release dates of new versions of our software products and upgrades 
new versions of our products may not be released on schedule or may contain defects when released 
we depend on technology licensed to us by third parties  and the loss or inability to maintain these licenses could prevent or delay sales of our products 
we license from several software providers technologies that are incorporated into our products 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future 
this software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
while currently we are not materially dependent on any single third party for such licenses  the loss of the technology licenses could result in delays in the license of our products until equivalent technology is developed or identified  licensed and integrated into our products 
even if substitute technologies are available  there can be no guarantee that we will be able to license these technologies on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
defects in third party products associated with our products could impair our products functionality and injure our reputation 
the effective implementation of our products depends upon the successful operation of third party products in conjunction with our products 
any undetected errors in these third party products could prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products  delay new product introductions or injure our reputation 
in the past  while our business has not been materially harmed  product releases have been delayed as a result of errors in third party software and we have incurred significant expenses fixing and investigating the cause of these errors 
our customers and systems integration partners may have the ability to alter our source code and resulting inappropriate alterations could adversely affect the performance of our products  cause injury to our reputation and increase operating expenses 
customers and systems integration partners may have access to the computer source code for certain elements of our products and may alter the source code 
alteration of our source code may lead to implementation  operation  technical support and upgrade problems for our customers 
this could adversely affect the market acceptance of our products  and any necessary investigative work and repairs could cause us to incur significant expenses and delays in implementation 
if our products do not operate with the hardware and software platforms used by our customers  our customers may license competing products and our revenues will decline 
if our products fail to satisfy advancing technological requirements of our customers and potential customers  the market acceptance of these products could be reduced 
we currently serve a customer base with a 
table of contents wide variety of constantly changing hardware  software applications and networking platforms 
customer acceptance of our products depends on many factors such as our ability to integrate our products with multiple platforms and existing or legacy systems  our ability to anticipate and support new standards  especially internet and enterprise java standards  and the integration of additional software modules and third party software applications with our existing products 
our failure to successfully integrate with future acquired or merged companies and technologies could prevent us from operating efficiently 
our business strategy includes pursuing opportunities to grow our business  both through internal growth and through merger  acquisition and technology and other asset transactions 
to implement this strategy  we may be involved in merger and acquisition activity  additional technology and asset purchase transactions 
merger and acquisition transactions are motivated by many factors  including  among others  our desire to grow our business  acquire skilled personnel  obtain new technologies and expand and enhance our product offerings 
growth through mergers and acquisitions has several identifiable risks  including difficulties associated with successfully integrating distinct businesses into new organizations  the substantial management time devoted to integrating personnel  technology and entire companies  the possibility that we might not be successful in retaining the employees  undisclosed liabilities  the failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and synergies and issues related to integrating acquired technology  merged acquired companies or content into our products such as unanticipated expenses 
realization of any of these risks in connection with any technology transaction or asset purchase we have entered into  or may enter into  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we become subject to intellectual property infringement claims  including patent infringement claims  these claims could be costly and time consuming to defend  divert management s attention  cause product delays and have an adverse effect on our revenues and net income 
we expect that software product developers and providers of software in markets similar to our target markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be costly and time consuming to defend  divert our management s attention or cause product delays 
if any of our products were found to infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to be able to sell our products 
royalty and licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
in particular  if we were sued for patent infringement by a patent holding company  one which has acquired large numbers of patents solely for the purpose of bringing suit against alleged infringers rather than practicing the patents  it may be costly to defend such suit 
if any of our products were found to infringe such patent  the patent holder could seek an injunction to enjoin our use of the infringing product 
this would have an extremely detrimental effect on our business 
if we were required to settle such claim  it could be extremely costly 
a patent infringement claim could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the application of percentage of completion accounting to our business is complex and may result in delays in the reporting of our financial results and revenue not being recognized as we expect 
although we attempt use standardized license agreements designed to meet current revenue recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles  we must often negotiate and revise terms and conditions of these standardized agreements  particularly in multi product transactions 
at the time of entering 
table of contents into a transaction  we assess whether any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products 
for contracts involving significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products  we recognize the license and professional consulting services revenues using the percentage of completion method using labor hours incurred as the measure of progress towards completion 
the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting is complex and involves judgments and estimates  which may change significantly based on customer requirements 
this complexity combined with changing customer requirements could result in delays in the proper determination of our percentage of completion estimates and revenue not being recognized as we expect 
we may be subject to an investigation by the sec or litigation by private parties in connection with the restatement of our interim financial statements for the fiscal quarters ended march   june   september   december   march   and june  in march  we concluded that our interim financial statements for the fiscal quarters ended march  june  and september  should no longer be relied upon because of various errors in such financial statements 
we restated those financial statements  which were reported in our transition report on form k t 
additionally  in the course of preparing our financial results for the year ended september   the company and its independent registered public accounting firm  bdo seidman  llp  identified certain errors in the company s interim financial statements for the quarters ended december   march   and june  and management concluded that as a result of these errors  the company should restate the company s interim financial statements for these quarters 
these errors are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
as a result  the sec may choose to begin an investigation or we may be subject to litigation  which could require significant management and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business 
if we are subject to an sec investigation or litigation  we could be required to pay penalties or damages or have other remedies imposed upon us 
in addition  we could become the target of expensive securities litigation related to other matters in the future 
any sec investigation or litigation could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we may continue to encounter unexpected delays in implementing the requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting and we expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management s time as a result of performing future system and process evaluation  testing and remediation required to comply with future management assessment and auditor attestation requirements 
in connection with the initial testing of internal controls certain material weaknesses were identified 
in future periods we will continue to document our internal controls to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls  as required by section of sox  within the time frame required by section we may encounter unexpected delays in implementing the requirements relating to internal controls  therefore  we cannot be certain about the timing of the completion of our evaluation  testing and remediation actions or the impact that these activities will have on our operations 
we also expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management s time as a result of performing the system and process evaluation  testing and remediation required to comply with management s assessment and auditor attestation requirements 
if we are not able to timely comply with the requirements set forth in section in future periods  we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by the regulatory authorities 
any such action could adversely affect our business or financial results

item legal proceedings beginning in july  we and certain of our officers and directors individuals were named as defendants in a series of class action shareholder complaints filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  now consolidated under the caption  in re chordiant software  inc initial public offering securities litigation  case no

similar complaints were filed in the same court against hundreds of other public companies issuers that conducted ipo s of their common stock in the late s or in the year collectively  the ipo lawsuits 
in august  all of the ipo lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial purposes before united states judge shira scheindlin of the southern district of new york 
in july  we joined in a global motion to dismiss the ipo lawsuits filed by all of the issuers among others 
in october  the court entered an order dismissing the individuals from the ipo cases without prejudice  pursuant to an agreement tolling the statute of limitations with respect to the individuals 
in february  the court issued a decision denying the motion to dismiss the section claims against chordiant and almost all of the other issuers and denying the motion to dismiss the section b claims against chordiant and many of the issuers 
in june  issuers and plaintiffs reached a tentative settlement agreement that would  among other things  result in the dismissal with prejudice of all claims against the issuers and individuals in the ipo lawsuits  and the assignment to plaintiffs of certain potential claims that the issuers may have against the underwriters 
the tentative settlement also provides that  in the event that plaintiffs ultimately recover less than a guaranteed sum of billion from the ipo underwriters  plaintiffs would be entitled to payment by each participating issuer s insurer of a pro rata share of any shortfall in the plaintiffs guaranteed recovery 
in september  in connection with the possible settlement  those individuals who had entered tolling agreements with plaintiffs described above agreed to extend those agreements so that they would not expire prior to any settlement being finalized

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
these statements are based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about our business and our industry  and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry s results  levels of activity  performance or achievement to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied in or contemplated by the forward looking statements 
words such as believe  anticipate  expect  intend  plan  will  may  should  estimate  predict  guidance  potential  continue or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions  identify forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to  those discussed in item of this form k under the caption risk factors and those discussed elsewhere in this annual report and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
chordiant undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events after the date of this report 
overview as an enterprise software vendor  we chordiant software  inc generate substantially all of our revenues from the financial services and telecommunications industries 
our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services out of their lines of business and information technology budgets 
as a result  our revenues are heavily influenced by our customers long term business outlook and willingness to invest in new enterprise information systems and business applications 
beginning in late calendar  the financial services and telecommunications industries entered into a steep and long economic downturn  with industry sales dropping from late through the first part of over the past several years  our customers have focused on controlling costs and reducing risk  including constraining information technology and lines of business expenditures and requiring more favorable pricing terms from their suppliers and pursuing consolidation within their own industries 
as a result of this downturn  our license fee revenues declined in fiscal beginning in the latter part of  economic conditions began to show signs of improvement  which were reflected in increases in various economic indicators such as productivity  labor statistics and consumer confidence 
this trend has continued through our fiscal year and appears to have a favorable impact  specifically in information technology spending 
for the year ended september  and the nine months ended september   we were able to grow total revenues on a year over year basis 
software industry consolidation and possible increased competition the software industry in general is undergoing a period of consolidation  and there has been recent consolidation in sectors of the software industry in which we operate 
in august  oracle announced that it will acquire a majority interest in i flex solutions  a banking software maker headquartered in mumbai  india 
in august  ibm announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire dwl  a provider of middleware to companies in the banking  insurance  retail and telecommunications industries 
in august  ssa global technologies announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire epiphany  inc  a maker of customer relationship management software products 
in september  oracle announced that it signed an agreement to acquire siebel systems  inc  a maker of customer relationship management software products 
while we do not believe that either i flex or dwl are competitors of chordiant  the acquisition activity of these large corporations of software providers to the industries we target may indicate that we will face increased competition from significantly larger and more established entities in the future 

table of contents financial trends backlog 
an increasingly material portion of our revenues has been derived from large orders  as major customers deployed our products 
as of september   we had approximately million in backlog  which we define as non cancelable contractual commitments by our customers through purchase orders or contracts 
backlog is comprised of current software license orders which have not been accepted by customers or have not otherwise met all of the required criteria for revenue recognition 
this component includes both unbilled amounts plus billed amounts classified as deferred revenue  deferred revenue from customer support contracts  consulting service orders representing the unbilled remaining balances of consulting contracts not yet completed or delivered  plus deferred consulting revenue  and education orders for services not yet completed or delivered 
backlog is not necessarily indicative of revenues to be recognized in a specified future period and is generally recognizable as revenue within a twelve month period 
there are many factors that would impact chordiant s conversion of backlog as recognizable revenue  such as chordiant s progress in completing projects for its customers  chordiant s customers meeting anticipated schedules for customer dependent deliverables and customers increasing the scope or duration of a contract causing license revenue to be deferred for a longer period of time 
chordiant provides no assurances that any portion of its backlog will be recognized as revenue during any fiscal year or at all or that its backlog will be recognized as revenues in any given period 
in addition  it is possible that customers from whom we expect to derive revenue from backlog will default and as a result we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog 
gross margins 
management focuses on license and service gross margin in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
gross margins on license revenues were and for the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
gross margins on license revenues were for both the nine months ended september  and gross margins on license revenues were for the year ended december  we expect license gross margin on current products to range from to in the foreseeable future 
the margin will fluctuate with the mix of products sold  with certain of the enterprise solution products having higher associated royalties payable to third parties and the marketing solution and decision management products having minimal associated royalties 
the banking product that was developed during the year ended september  will also have higher royalties than our existing products 
gross margins on service revenues were and for the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
gross margin on service revenues was for both the nine months ended september  and gross margin on service revenues was for the year ended december  service revenues 
service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were and for the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were and for the nine months ended september  and  respectively 
service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were for the year ended december  we expect that service revenues will continue to represent over of our total revenues in the foreseeable future 
revenues from international customers versus north america revenues 
for all periods presented  revenues were principally derived from customer accounts in north america and europe 
for the twelve months ended september  and  international revenues were million and million  or approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
for the nine months ended september  and  international revenues were million and million  or approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   international revenues were million  or 
table of contents approximately of our total revenues 
we believe international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
for the twelve months ended september  and  north america revenues were million and million  or approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
for the nine months ended september  and  north america revenues were million and million  or approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   north america revenues were million  or approximately of our total revenues 
as the us economy has strengthened  we have seen an increase in north america revenues 
we believe north america revenues will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenues in future periods 
acquisition of kiq limited 
on december   we acquired kiq limited  a privately held united kingdom software company with branch offices in the netherlands kiq  specializing in the development and sales of decision management systems 
the year ended september  includes the revenues and expenses of kiq for more than nine months 
the acquisition resulted in an increase to our headcount of approximately employees as of the acquisition date 
the majority of these individuals are in the cost of service and research and development areas  accordingly personnel costs are now higher in these categories for the year ended september  kiq operations have been integrated into the financial operations and the decision management products are actively being marketed to customers across all regions 
costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of for the year ended september   general and administrative expenses include significant professional services costs relating with efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of we expect these costs to continue for the first quarter of fiscal year while these costs are expected to decline during the remainder of fiscal year  the level of decline is uncertain 
reduction in workforce 
in july  we undertook an approximate reduction in our workforce 
in connection with this action  we incurred a one time cash charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter ended september  for severance benefits 
as a result of this reduction in force  we expect to realize aggregate internal cost savings of approximately million per quarter 
such savings will primarily be in the areas of sales and marketing and research and development 
we anticipate a full offset to this savings attributable to increased sales commissions  a new marketing campaign and outsourced development expenses associated with new product deliverables 
past results may not be indicative of future performance 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our prospects must be considered given the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving businesses 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
moreover  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  restructuring costs  contingencies  vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value in multiple element arrangements and the estimates associated with the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain of our revenue contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to 
table of contents be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  including estimating the total estimated time required to complete sales arrangements involving significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  restructuring costs  and determining functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from licenses of our software and related services  which include assistance in implementation  customization and integration  post contract customer support  training and consulting 
the amount and timing of our revenue is difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in increased operating losses 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretation of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position no 
software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position no 
software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements collectively sop 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue for services and post contract customer support based upon vsoe of fair value of the respective elements 
vsoe of fair value for the services element is based upon the standard hourly rates we charge for the services when such services are sold separately 
the vsoe of fair value for annual post contract customer support is generally established with the contractual future renewal rates included in the contracts when the renewal rate is substantive and consistent with the fees when support services are sold separately 
when contracts contain multiple elements and vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements  principally the license portion  based upon the residual method as prescribed by sop in multiple element transactions where vsoe is not established for an undelivered element  we recognize revenue upon the establishment of vsoe for that element or when the element is delivered 
at the time we enter into a transaction  we assess whether any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products 
for contracts for products that do not involve significant implementation or customization essential to the product functionality  we recognize license revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable and delivery has occurred as prescribed by sop no 

table of contents for contracts that involve significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products  we recognize the license and professional consulting services revenue using either the percentage of completion method or the completed contract method as prescribed by statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts sop 
the percentage of completion method is applied when we have the ability to make reasonable dependable estimates of the total effort required for completion using labor hours incurred as the measure of progress towards completion 
the progress toward completion is measured based on the go live date 
we define the go live date as the date the essential product functionality has been delivered or the application enters into a production environment or the point at which no significant additional chordiant supplied professional services resources are required 
estimates are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
we account for the changes as changes in accounting estimates when the information becomes known 
information impacting estimates obtained after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the financial statements is used to update the estimates 
provisions for estimated contract losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
when we sell additional licenses related to the original licensing agreement  revenue is recognized upon delivery if the project has reached the go live date  or if the project has not reached the go live date  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
we classify revenues from these arrangements as license and service revenues based upon the estimated fair value of each element 
the completed contract method is applied when we are unable to obtain reasonable dependable estimates of the total effort required for completion 
under the completed contract method  all revenue and related costs of revenue are deferred and recognized upon completion 
we recognize revenue for post contract customer support ratably over the support period which ranges from one to three years 
our training and consulting services revenues are recognized as such services are performed on an hourly or daily basis for time and material contracts 
for consulting services arrangements with a fixed fee  we recognize revenue on the proportional performance method 
in situations in which we are obligated to provide unspecified additional software products in the future  we recognize revenue as a subscription ratably over the term of the commitment period 
for all sales we use either a signed license agreement or a binding purchase order where we have a master license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our third party systems integrators are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders or order forms on a transaction by transaction basis 
revenues from reseller arrangements are recognized on the sell through method  when the reseller reports to us the sale of our software products to end users 
our agreements with customers and resellers do not contain product return rights 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
generally  we require no collateral from our customers 
our accounts receivable balance was million with an allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of september  our accounts receivable balance was million with an allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of 
table of contents september  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of september   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits 
this valuation allowance offsets of the deferred tax asset at september  deferred tax assets have been fully reserved for in all periods presented 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
furthermore  we assess the impairment of goodwill annually 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  market capitalization declines relative to net book value  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
when one or more of the above indicators of impairment occurs we estimate the value of long lived assets and intangible assets to determine whether there is impairment 
we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method  which requires us to make several estimates including the estimated cash flows associated with the asset  the period over which these cash flows will be generated and a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
these estimates are subjective and if we made different estimates  it could materially impact the estimated fair value of these assets and the conclusions we reached regarding an impairment 
to date  we have not identified any triggering events which would require us to perform this analysis 
we are required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance on at least an annual basis 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill  of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we proceed on to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 

table of contents step we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to our identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess 
we determined that we have one reporting unit 
we completed a goodwill impairment review for the period including september  and performed step of the goodwill impairment analysis required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of september  using the methodology described above 
accordingly  step was not performed 
we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount 
restructuring costs 
during the quarter ended september   we undertook an approximate reduction in our workforce 
charges incurred related to severance payments in both north america and europe 
during the quarter ended september   we announced plans to reallocate staff between our north american and european operations to better support our growth in north america 
this restructuring plan included a reduction in workforce and incurred charges related to severance agreements in europe 
during fiscal years and  we implemented cost reduction plans as part of our continued effort to streamline our operations to reduce ongoing operating expenses 
these plans resulted in restructuring charges related to  among others  the consolidation of excess facilities 
these charges relate to facilities and portions of facilities we no longer utilize and either seek to terminate early or sublease 
lease termination costs and brokerage fees for the abandoned facilities were estimated for the remaining lease obligations and were offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees and sublease rates which can be achieved using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage retained by us 
each reporting period we review these estimates and to the extent that these assumptions change due to new agreements with landlords  new subleases with tenants  or changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary by material amounts 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation 
we have several foreign subsidiaries that together account for a significant portion of our revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate part of our net equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary conducts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency were deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements would be included in cumulative translation adjustments 
however  if the functional currency were deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement 
table of contents of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be recognized in our statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly  we had a foreign currency translation loss of approximately million for the year ended september  and a foreign currency translation gain of less than million  which were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income within our balance sheet at september  and  respectively 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
these currencies include the united kingdom pound sterling  the euro and canadian dollars 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations 
prior to june  the settlement of accumulated intercompany loans and advances was not planned or anticipated

total license revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  license revenues for enterprise solutions decreased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily due to the timing of revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the timing and amount of revenue recognized is influenced by the progress of work performed relative to the project length of customer contracts and the dollar value of such contracts 
license revenues for marketing solutions decreased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  license revenues for decision management solutions relate to the products acquired in the kiq transaction and were million for year ended september  service 
total service revenues  which include reimbursement of out of pocket expenses  increased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  service revenues associated with enterprise solution products increased 
table of contents million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  this increase was due to a continuation in large customer implementations as well as maintenance  support and consulting revenues associated with license agreements entered into in current and prior periods 
service revenues associated with marketing solution products decreased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  service revenues associated with decision management solution products relate to the products acquired in the kiq transaction and were million for the year ended september  reimbursement of out of pocket expenses which are included in total service revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  this increase is primarily due to the higher number of third party consultants and employees working on projects 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  these costs resulted in license gross margins of approximately and for the year ended september  and  respectively 
the license gross margin for the year ended september  is higher than in the recent past due to lower royalties payable associated with the mix of products sold 
the number of product components subject to the payment of royalties in the past declined during the year ended september  revenues derived from the sale of kiq products are also not subject to significant royalties

this net cash 
table of contents inflow was primarily caused by an increase in deferred revenue and the collection of accounts receivable  offset by the payment of accounts payable and accrued expenses  and additions to prepaid expenses and other assets

future payments due under lease obligations as of september  are as follows in thousands capital leases operating leases operating sublease income net operating leases fiscal year ended september total minimum payments our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances may decline further during fiscal year however  we believe that the effects of our strategic actions implemented to improve revenue as well as to control costs will be adequate to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  which  when combined with existing cash balances  we anticipate will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the near term 
if the global economy weakens further  the decline in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances may be greater than presently anticipated

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of our non traded  available for sale marketable securities 
the following table presents the amounts of marketable securities and restricted cash that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of september  in thousands september  fair value restricted cash in short term investments average interest rates the following table presents the amounts of marketable securities and restricted cash that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of september  in thousands september  fair value restricted cash in short term investments marketable securities average interest rates interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our investment portfolio 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
a significant portion of our sales and operating expenses result from transactions outside of the united states  often in foreign currencies 
these currencies include the united kingdom pound sterling  the euro and canadian dollars 
international revenues from our foreign subsidiaries accounted for approximately of total revenues for the year ended september  international sales are made mostly from our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
additionally  two of our foreign subsidiaries hold cash equivalent investments in currencies other than its respective local currency 
such holdings increase our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
as exchange rates vary  the holdings may magnify foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or upon translation or adversely impact overall expected profitability through foreign currency losses incurred upon the sale or maturity of the investments 
at september  approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to changing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility when compared to the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
