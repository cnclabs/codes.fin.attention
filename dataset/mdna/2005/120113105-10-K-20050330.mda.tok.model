item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear in item of form k as well as the caption under this item entitled business risks and forward looking statements 
overview homebuilding industry new home construction in the united states remained strong in  with housing starts at historically high levels 
single family housing starts were at million  a increase over low mortgage rates  consumer confidence and a favorable economic environment shape the current housing industry 
from a long term perspective  demographic trends from the us census bureau indicate continued strength in homebuilding 
our focus our segment of the homebuilding industry of providing building materials and construction services is evolving to satisfy the needs of builders and contractors seeking full service providers 
in particular  high volume production homebuilders are seeking quality  reliable and cost effective construction services solutions 
our growth strategy focuses on increasing construction services through acquisitions and expanding products and services at existing operations to satisfy the needs of builders and contractors 
we compete in the homebuilding industry through two business segments bmc west and bmc construction 
with locations in the western and southern states  bmc west distributes building products and manufactures building components for professional builders and contractors 
bmc construction provides construction services to high volume production homebuilders through operations in key growth markets in western  southern and east coast states 
these two business segments are subsidiaries of our holding company building materials holding corporation 
acquisition history over the past three years  bmc construction completed several purchases to enter new markets and expand construction service offerings at existing operations 
significant acquisitions include rci construction  llc a company providing framing services in the greater chicago area january interest kbi norcal a framing services business in northern california july interest  july the remaining wbc mid atlantic  llc a company providing framing services in delaware  the district of columbia  maryland and virginia october interest wbc construction  llc a company providing foundation and shell construction services in florida january interest bmc west has also completed acquisitions and continues to pursue initiatives to expand truss manufacturing  millwork fabrication and construction services at existing operations 
risks and uncertainties housing demand  subject to the influences of interest rates  consumer confidence  the general economic environment  job growth  demographic trends as well as numerous other local factors  remains a key component upon which our success depends 
additionally  commodity wood product prices which are subject to significant volatility  were substantially higher in relative to the prior year  augmenting sales and operating income 
despite these factors  we anticipate strong homebuilding activity in our markets in as we grow our construction services expertise and expand product and service offerings to meet the needs of our customers 
we measure our operating performance and financial condition based on several factors including sales income from operations management of working capital and assets return on investment we evaluate our results of operations including and excluding charges for impairments as well as recent acquisitions not present in comparable periods 
we believe these measures enhance an understanding of our operating results for the respective reporting periods 
the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition provides information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  changes in key items in those financial statements and the primary factors that accounted for those changes 
the discussion of our consolidated financial results is followed by a more detailed review of our business segments

income from operations increased to million from million in the prior year 
gross margins were and approximately the same as the prior year of 
margins for building products were lower  while margins for construction services improved 
other operating expenses were of sales compared to in the prior year as a result of leveraging these costs against higher sales at bmc west and maintaining these costs as a percent of sales at bmc construction and corporate 
bmc west selected financial results are as follows millions sales income from operations sales of billion were higher than the prior year 
the increase was due to both growth in sales at existing business units and the impact of higher commodity wood product prices relative to the prior year 
in addition to the benefit of commodity prices  higher sales were due to strong housing demand as building permits in our markets were up compared to the prior year 
income from operations was million  up from million in the prior year 
despite rising commodity wood product prices  gross margins remained at approximately  reflective of our effective management of inventory 
operating expenses were up million or compared to the prior year primarily due to variable compensation expenses 
however  these operating expenses were leveraged against higher sales as they decreased to of sales compared to the prior year 
bmc construction selected financial results are as follows millions sales less acquisitions income from operations less acquisitions income loss sales of million increased over the prior year 
acquisitions of construction services businesses not present in comparable periods accounted for million or of the increase with the remaining million from existing operations

corporate selected financial results are as follows millions operating expenses corporate operating expenses include administrative costs to support operations at our bmc west and bmc construction business segments

however  these expenses at of consolidated sales were lower compared to in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources our primary need for capital resources is to fund working capital and acquisitions as well as finance capital expenditures 
capital resources have primarily consisted of cash flows from operations and additional debt 
operations net cash provided from operating activities was million  up significantly from million in strong home construction and our strategy to provide additional construction services resulted in higher net income which provided million of additional cash flow over the prior year 
changes in working capital requirements used million of this cash flow 
net cash provided from operating activities in was million  down million from million in net income was million and consistent with million in prior to the impairment of goodwill 
however  working capital requirements were million more than the prior year due to acquisitions as well as strong sales performance and increased inventories in order to take advantage of falling commodity wood product prices in december capital investment and acquisitions net cash used in investing activities was million compared to million in cash use included million for property and equipment  million for the acquisition of four businesses and million invested in marketable securities at our captive insurance subsidiary 
net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million in cash use included million for property and equipment and million for our interests in wbc mid atlantic and wbc construction 
the cash use was partially offset by proceeds of million from the disposition of assets and million from the sale of a facility in great falls  montana 
cash used for purchase of property and equipment net of sales proceeds was lower than the prior year due to an objective to limit these expenditures in financing net cash provided by financing activities was million  compared to million in the primary sources of cash were million of net borrowings from the revolving credit facility and an increase in book overdrafts and stock options exercised net of tax benefit 
cash from the net borrowings of the revolver  book overdrafts and stock options exercised were used to make payments on the term note  other notes and dividends 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million in the primary sources of cash were million of net borrowings from the revolving credit facility and a million increase in borrowings from a term note 
revolving credit facility in august  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with a group of lenders 
in july and pursuant to the agreement  the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility was increased by million 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to of inventory plus of eligible receivables 
the borrowing base is calculated monthly and limited to million 
the revolving credit facility matures in august the revolving credit facility consists of both libor and prime based borrowings 
the revolving credit facility was amended in may to reduce interest rates by and in march to reduce interest rates by another 
interest rates are subject to quarterly adjustment based on operating performance and range from libor plus to  or prime plus to 
as of december   the borrowing base was limited to the maximum of million  million of which was outstanding 
at year end  the availability under the revolving credit facility was million  net of million in outstanding letters of credit 
term note in august  we entered into a million term note with a group of lenders 
the term note matures in august and is payable in quarterly installments for the first six years in amounts equal to of the initial principal amount per year and equal quarterly installments for the remaining principal balance during year seven 
as of december   million was outstanding under the term note 
the term note was amended in may to reduce the interest rate by and in march to reduce the interest rate by another 
the interest rates for the term note are libor plus or prime plus 
other other long term debt consists of a term note  equipment notes and capital leases for equipment and software 
interest rates are various and dates of maturity are through november hedging activities derivative and hedging activities are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values 
in june  we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a portion of the floating rate borrowings of the term note to a fixed interest rate through june  thus reducing the impact of increases in interest rates on future interest expense 
approximately of the outstanding floating rate borrowings of the term note as of december  have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as a result  the interest rate on million of the million floating rate borrowings outstanding at december  was fixed at an average rate of 
however  in march the term note was amended to reduce the interest rate by and these floating rate borrowings are currently fixed at an average rate of 
after giving effect to the interest rate swap contracts  total borrowings are fixed and floating 
the fair value of derivative instruments is based on pricing models using current market rates 
the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a long term liability of million as of december  the effective portion was recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss  net  a separate component of shareholders equity  and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item  interest expense  in the same period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings 
a corresponding deferred tax asset of million was also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net for the income tax benefit related to the estimated liability of the interest rate swap contracts 
the ineffective portion of the change in the value of the interest rate swap contracts is immediately recognized as a component of interest expense 
there was no hedge ineffectiveness for the period ended december  management may choose not to swap floating debt to a fixed rate or may terminate a previously executed swap if the floating rate positions are more beneficial 
the revolving credit facility and term note are collateralized by all tangible and intangible property  except assets of the captive insurance subsidiary 
the revolving credit facility and term note contain covenants and conditions requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants and conditions 
the scheduled principal payments of debt are million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
equity in the third quarter of  a shelf registration was filed with the securities and exchange commission to register two million common shares 
we may issue these shares in connection with future business combinations  mergers or acquisitions 
shares issued from this registration for a portion of the purchase price for acquisitions include common shares of  for wbc mid atlantic   for wbc construction and  for kbi norcal see note of
