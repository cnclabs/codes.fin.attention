rent coverage is after non subordinated management fees of million and million in the year ended december  and  respectively 
marriott guarantees the lease for the properties leased to sunrise 
ibc  a pennsylvania health insurer  guarantees the lease for the properties leased to newseasons 
effective january   we entered an amended lease with healthsouth for two hospitals 
in april  we commenced a lawsuit against healthsouth seeking  among other matters  to reform the amended lease  based upon healthsouth s fraud  by increasing the rent payable to us from the date of amendment forward 
this litigation is pending at this time 
on october   we terminated the amended lease for default because healthsouth failed to deliver to us accurate and timely financial information as required by the amended lease 
on november   healthsouth brought a new lawsuit against us seeking to prevent our termination of the amended lease 
on november   after a hearing  the court denied healthsouth s request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the lease termination 
we are currently seeking an expedited judicial determination that the lease termination was valid and we are pursuing damages against healthsouth in the lawsuit which we brought in we have also begun work to identify and qualify a new tenant operator for the hospitals 
our lease with healthsouth requires that  after termination  healthsouth manage the hospitals for our account for a management fee during the period of the transition to a new tenant and remit the net cash flow to us 
during the pendency of these disputes  healthsouth has continued to pay us at the disputed rent amount and we have applied the payments received against the net cash flow due  but we do not know how long healthsouth may continue to make payments 
all tenant operating data presented are based upon the operating results provided by our tenants for the indicated periods ending december   or the most recent prior period for which tenant operating results are available to us from our tenants 
rent coverage is calculated as operating cash flow from our tenants facility operations  before subordinated charges and capital expenditure reserves  divided by rent payable to us 
we have not independently verified our tenants operating data 
includes data for periods prior to our ownership of these properties 
during  healthsouth issued a press release stating that its historical financial information should not be relied upon 
in  healthsouth issued a press release stating that audited financial information would not be available until because we have reason to doubt whatever information we have from healthsouth  we do not disclose any operating data for this tenant 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  year ended december  change change in thousands  except per share amounts rental income interest and other income interest expense depreciation expense general and administrative expense net income weighted average shares outstanding net income per share rental income increased because of rents from our real estate acquisitions totaling million during and the full impact of rents from our million of acquisitions in interest and other income for the year ended december   includes a million settlement payment we received from marriott in january for the year ended december   interest and other income includes  of proceeds from the sale of a mortgage note 
interest expense increased because of our issuance of million of senior unsecured notes in april our weighted average balance outstanding and interest rate under our revolving bank facility was million and and million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depreciation expense increased because of real estate acquisitions totaling million and because of depreciation for a full year of real estate acquisitions totaling million 
general and administrative expenses include  in  million of due diligence costs incurred in connection with a failed potential acquisition and healthsouth litigation costs  and in  million in connection with our litigations with marriott and healthsouth 
general and administrative expense  exclusive of due diligence and litigation costs  increased in by million  or due to advisory fees associated with our acquisitions  and accounting and other costs incurred for the implementation of the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec rules 
during the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million from the sale of one property 
during the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million from the sale of one property 
net income and net income per share increased because of the changes described above in revenues and expenses offset by the increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding that resulted from our issuance of common shares during year ended december   compared to year ended december  year ended december  change change in thousands  except per share amounts rental income ff e reserve income interest and other income interest expense depreciation expense general and administrative expense net income weighted average shares outstanding net income per share rental income increased because of our acquisitions totaling million during and the full impact of rents from our million of acquisitions during we recorded ff e reserve income in because one of our leases with five star required a percentage of gross revenues be paid to us as additional rent  which was escrowed for future capital expenditures at the leased facilities 
this lease was amended on october  as a result of this amendment  the ff e reserve escrow deposits are not paid to us as additional rent  but are paid into accounts owned by five star 
accordingly  we no longer record ff e reserve income 
we have security and remainder interests in these accounts and in property purchased with funding from these accounts 
interest and other income for the year ended december   includes  of proceeds from the sale of a mortgage note 
in connection with one of our acquisitions  we were assigned the rights under this mortgage note from a third party 
the mortgage note was allocated zero value at the time of the assignment 
however  in march  we sold the note to an affiliate of the note obligor for  interest and other income for the year ended december   includes  of mortgage interest income from mortgage financing we provided in february to alterra  and a net operating loss of  from the property we repossessed from a tenant which defaulted its lease obligations to us in march interest expense increased because of our issuance of million of senior unsecured notes in april  partially offset by less interest expense on reduced amounts outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility during our weighted average balance outstanding and interest rate under our revolving bank credit facility was million and and million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depreciation expense increased because of real estate acquisitions totaling million and because of depreciation for a full year of real estate acquisitions totaling million 
general and administrative expenses include  in  million in connection with our litigations with marriott and healthsouth 
in january  we settled our litigation with marriott 
general and administrative expense  exclusive of litigation costs  increased in by  or  due to advisory fees associated with our acquisitions 
during the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million from the sale of one property 
in the year ended december   we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million at a facility leased to five star which was closed and subsequently sold during net income and net income per share decreased because of the changes described above in revenues and expenses and the increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding resulting from our issuance of our common shares during liquidity and capital resources our operating liquidity and resources rents from our properties are our principal sources of funds for current expenses and distributions to shareholders 
we generally receive minimum rents monthly or quarterly from our tenants and we receive percentage rents monthly  quarterly or annually 
this flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses  debt service and distributions to our shareholders 
we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  debt service and distribution payments for the foreseeable future 
our investment and financing liquidity and resources in order to fund acquisitions and to accommodate cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of rents and our need to pay operating expenses and our desire to make distributions to our shareholders  we maintain a revolving bank credit facility with a group of commercial banks and other lenders 
our revolving bank credit facility matures in november  but we may extend it to november upon payment of an extension fee 
the revolving bank credit facility permits us to borrow up to million and includes a feature under which we may expand the maximum borrowing to million  in certain circumstances 
borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility are unsecured 
we may borrow  repay and reborrow funds until maturity 
no principal repayment is due until maturity 
we pay interest on borrowings under the revolving bank credit facility at libor plus a margin 
in january  we issued five million of our common shares in a public offering 
we used the net proceeds of million to repay borrowings outstanding on our revolving bank credit facility 
in april  we sold one of our nursing home properties for million 
we used the proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding on our revolving bank credit facility and for general business purposes 
in june  we purchased for million the land under one of our properties that we had previously leased 
during  we purchased million of improvements made to some of our properties 
we borrowed on our revolving bank credit facility and used cash on hand to fund these purchases 
in november  we purchased assisted living properties from five star for million and loaned five star million secured by five properties  which five star repaid in december this purchase and loan were funded by our assumption of million of mortgage debt and borrowing on our revolving bank credit facility 
in december  we issued five million of our common shares in a public offering  raising net proceeds of million 
we used the net proceeds from the offering and the five star mortgage repayment to repay borrowings outstanding on our revolving bank credit facility and for general business purposes 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving bank credit facility 
we expect to use cash balances  borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future property acquisitions and expenditures related to the repair  maintenance or renovation of our properties 
when significant amounts are outstanding on our revolving bank credit facility or as the maturity dates of our revolving bank credit facility and term debts approach  we will explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives may include incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities 
as of december   we had billion available on an effective shelf registration statement 
an effective shelf registration statement allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities 
although there can be no assurance that we will consummate any debt or equity offerings or other financings  we believe we will have access to various types of financings  including debt or equity offerings  with which to finance future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations 
on january   we declared a distribution of per common share with respect to our fourth quarter results 
this distribution was paid to shareholders on february   using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
as of december   our contractual payment obligations were as follows dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations ground lease obligations total our term debt maturities are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in as of march   we have no commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  joint ventures or partnerships 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than our trust preferred securities issued by an unconsolidated subsidiary of ours 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
debt covenants our principal debt obligations at december   were our unsecured revolving bank credit facility  two issues totaling million of unsecured senior notes and our million of junior subordinated debentures 
our senior notes are governed by an indenture 
this indenture and related supplements and our revolving bank credit facility contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain other ratios 
our junior subordinated debentures are governed by an indenture which is generally less restrictive than the indenture governing our senior notes and the terms of our revolving bank credit facility 
as of december   we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our indentures and related supplements and our revolving bank credit facility 
in addition to our unsecured debt obligations  we had million of mortgage debt and secured bonds outstanding at december  our mortgage debt and secured bonds are secured by of our properties 
none of our indentures and related supplements  our revolving bank credit facility or our other debt obligations contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings 
however  our revolving bank credit facility uses our senior debt rating to determine the fees and the interest rate payable 
our public debt indenture and related supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of million or more 
similarly  a default on our public debt indenture or junior subordinated debentures indenture would be a default under our revolving bank credit facility 
related party transactions in  hrpt distributed a majority of our shares to its shareholders 
in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into a transaction agreement with hrpt  pursuant to which it was agreed that so long as hrpt owns more than of our shares  we and hrpt engage the same manager  or we and hrpt have one or more common managing trustees  then we will not invest in office buildings  including medical office buildings and clinical laboratory buildings  without the prior consent of hrpt s independent trustees  and hrpt will not invest in properties involving senior housing without the prior consent of our independent trustees 
if an investment involves both office and senior housing components  the character of the investment will be determined by building area  excluding common areas  unless our board and hrpt s board otherwise agree at the time 
these provisions do not apply to any investments hrpt held at the time of the spin off 
also as part of the transaction agreement  we agreed to subject our ability to waive ownership restrictions contained in our charter to the consent of hrpt s trustees so long as hrpt owns more than of our outstanding voting or equity interests 
as of march   hrpt owns of our outstanding common shares 
on december   we distributed substantially all of our shares of five star to our shareholders 
in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into agreements with five star  pursuant to which it was agreed that so long as we remain a real estate investment trust  five star may not waive the share ownership restrictions in its charter on the ability of any person or group to acquire more than of any class of its equity shares without  among other requirements  our consent and five star s determination that the exception to the ownership limitations would not cause a default under any of its leases  so long as five star is our tenant  five star will neither permit any person or group to acquire more than of any class of five star s voting stock or permit the occurrence of other change in control events  as defined  nor will five star take any action that  in the reasonable judgment of us or hrpt  might jeopardize the tax status of us or hrpt as a real estate investment trust  we have the option  upon the acquisition by a person or group of more than of five star s voting stock and upon other change in control events of five star  as defined  to cancel all of five star s rights under its leases with us  and so long as five star maintains its shared service agreement with rmr or is a tenant under a lease with us  five star will not acquire or finance any real estate without first giving us  hrpt  hospitality properties trust  or hpt  or any other publicly owned real estate investment trust or other entity managed by rmr the opportunity to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which we  hrpt  hpt or any other publicly owned real estate investment trust or other entity managed by rmr  respectively  invest 
at the time five star was spun off from us  all of the persons serving as directors of five star were also our trustees 
two of our trustees  messrs 
martin and portnoy  are currently directors of five star 
as of december   we leased senior living communities to five star for total annual minimum rent of million 
during  we and five star were jointly involved in litigation with marriott  which was the operator of of the senior living communities which we leased to five star 
we and five star equally shared the costs of this litigation 
this litigation was settled in january since january   we have entered or agreed to enter into several transactions with five star  including the following during  pursuant to the terms of our leases with five star  we purchased million of improvements to our properties leased by five star  and the annual rent payable to us by five star was increased by of the amounts invested  or  on march   we purchased from five star one senior living community with units located in maryland 
the purchase price was million  the appraised value of the property 
simultaneous with this purchase  our existing leases with five star were modified as follows the lease for nursing homes and the lease for independent and assisted living communities were combined into one lease and the property acquired on march  was added to this combined lease  the combined lease maturity date was changed to december  from december  and for the separate leases  the minimum rent for the combined lease of nursing homes and independent living communities was increased by million  and for all of our leases with five star  the amount of additional rent to be paid to us was changed to of the increase in revenues at the leased properties beginning in all other lease terms remained substantially unchanged 
during  we agreed to sell to five star two nursing homes in michigan that we leased to five star 
the purchase price for both properties is million  the appraised value of the properties 
in april  we sold one of these properties to five star for million 
the properties were leased on a combined basis with other properties we lease to five star 
under the terms of our lease with five star  upon the sale of each property  the annual rent payable under the combined lease is reduced by of the net proceeds that we receive from the sale 
we expect the sale of the second property to occur during the first half of however  this sale is contingent upon five star s obtaining department of housing and urban development insured financing for its purchase 
this sale may not close because of a failure of this condition or for some other reason 
during  one of our private company tenants defaulted its lease for a nursing home in missouri 
we terminated this lease and five star managed this property for our account until may effective may   this property was added to a pre existing five star lease from us and the annual rent under that lease was increased by  all other lease terms remained unchanged 
one of our properties leased to five star was subject to a ground lease from an unaffiliated third party 
five star has been responsible for paying the ground rent of  per year 
on june   we exercised an option to purchase this land for million and we acquired the landlord s rights and obligations under the ground lease 
five star remains obligated for the ground lease payments to us 
in november  we loaned five star million which five star used to fund its acquisition of lta holdings  inc  or lta 
in the same month  this loan was repaid in full from the proceeds of our purchase of assisted living properties with  units from five star for million 
simultaneously  five star leased these properties from us for annual rent of million  plus the possibility of additional rent starting in calculated as a percentage of revenue increases at the leased properties 
the lease for of the properties was combined with another lease between us and five star 
two additional leases covering and properties  respectively  were entered into with five star 
these leases provide that the properties will be added to the lease covering the other properties upon the repayment of the mortgages secured by the properties 
in connection with five star s purchase of lta  we also loaned five star million secured by five properties  this loan was repaid in full in december in january and december  we completed two public offerings for a total of million of our common shares 
simultaneous with these offerings  hrpt sold  of our shares which it owned 
we and hrpt were parties to joint underwriting agreements in connection with these offerings 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our shares by hrpt  and hrpt paid its pro rata share of the expenses of these offerings 
the shares sold by hrpt were offered pursuant to an effective registration statement filed by us pursuant to an agreement with hrpt 
hrpt paid the expenses of this registration 
rmr provides investment  management and administrative services to us under an agreement which is subject to annual renewal by our compensation committee  which is comprised of our independent trustees 
rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to a percentage of our average real estate investments  as defined 
the percentage applied to our investments at the time we were spun off from hrpt is 
the annual compensation percentage for the first million of investments made since our spin off from hrpt is and thereafter is  plus an incentive fee based upon increases in our funds from operations per share  as defined 
the incentive fee payable to rmr is paid in common shares 
aggregate fees earned by rmr during for services were million  including  as an incentive fee which will be paid in common shares in april our compensation committee has approved the renewal of the rmr agreement for its current term which will end december  rmr also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly owned companies to which it provides management services 
we pay a pro rata share of rmr s costs in providing that function 
our audit committee approves the identity and salary of the individual serving as our internal audit manager  as well as the pro rata share of the costs which we pay 
rmr is owned by messrs 
martin and portnoy who are our managing trustees 
messrs 
martin and portnoy each have material interests in the transactions between us and rmr and five star described above 
all transactions between us and rmr or five star are approved by our independent trustees 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and assessments are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our three most critical accounting policies concern our investments in real property and are allocation of purchase price and recognition of depreciation expense 
the acquisition cost of each real property investment is allocated to various property components such as land  buildings and improvements  and each component generally has a different useful life 
acquisition cost allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on our management s estimates or  under some circumstances  studies commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms 
we allocate the value of real estate acquired among building  land  furniture  fixtures and equipment  the value of in place leases and the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships 
we compute related depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
the value of intangible assets is amortized over the term of the respective lease 
the allocated cost of land is not depreciated 
inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs or incorrect estimates of useful lives could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods required by generally accepted accounting principles 
impairment of assets 
we periodically evaluate our real property investments for impairment indicators 
these indicators may include weak or declining tenant profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life and market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real property investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that property 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows 
this analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so  or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
classification of leases 
our real property investments are generally leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property  discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
these policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual values  the ability of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties are operated 
in the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not now known  and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
impact of inflation inflation might have both positive and negative impacts upon us 
inflation might cause the value of our real estate investments to increase 
in an inflationary environment  the percentage rents which we receive based upon a percentage of our tenants revenues should increase 
offsetting these benefits  inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and other operating costs to increase 
an increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs will result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues 
in periods of rapid inflation  our tenants operating costs may increase faster than revenues and this fact may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our rent 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased operating costs at our leased properties  we generally require our tenants to guarantee our rent 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased costs of debt capital in the event of material inflation  we previously have purchased interest rate cap agreements and we may enter into similar interest rate hedge arrangements in the future 
the decision to enter into these agreements was and will be based on the amount of floating rate debt outstanding  our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements 
impact of government reimbursement approximately of our current annual rents come from properties where approximately or more of the operating revenues are derived from residents who pay from their own private resources 
the remaining of our rents come from properties where the revenues are heavily dependent upon medicare and medicaid programs 
the operations of these properties currently produce sufficient cash flow to support our rent 
however  as discussed above in business government regulation and reimbursement  we expect that medicare and medicaid rates paid to our tenants may not increase in amounts sufficient to pay our tenants increased operating costs  or that they may even decline 
also  the hospitals we lease to healthsouth are heavily dependent upon medicare revenues 
as discussed in item  reports of erroneous financial statements by healthsouth have called into question whether those hospitals in fact produce sufficient revenues to pay our rent 
we cannot predict whether our tenants which are affected by medicare and medicaid rates will be able to continue to pay their rent obligations if these expected circumstances occur and persist for an extended time 
seasonality nursing home and assisted living operations have historically reflected modest seasonality 
during calendar fourth quarter holiday periods  residents at such facilities are sometimes discharged to join in family celebrations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors and others  these operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of each calendar year and lesser earnings in the fourth and first calendar quarters 
we do not expect these seasonal differences to have a material impact upon the ability of our tenants to pay our rent 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the future 
at december   our outstanding debt included million of senior unsecured notes due in  million of senior unsecured notes due in and million of junior subordinated debentures due the interest is payable semi annually on the senior notes and quarterly on the debentures 
no principal payments are due under these notes or debentures until maturity 
because these notes and debentures bear interest at a fixed rate  changes in market interest rates during the term of this debt will not affect our operating results 
if these notes and debentures are refinanced at interest rates which are higher or lower than the current rate  our per annum interest cost would change by approximately million 
we are allowed to make prepayments of these senior notes  in whole or in part  at par plus a premium  as defined 
prior to april   we may redeem up to of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of qualified equity offerings  as defined 
our debentures have provisions that allow us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
our total fixed rate debt obligations outstanding at december   was million  including the million of notes due in  million of notes due in  million of junior subordinated debentures due in and mortgage notes totaling million due between and based on the balances outstanding at december   and discounted cash flow analysis through the maturity date of our fixed rated debt obligations  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would change the fair value of those obligations by approximately million 
our ability to prepay the debentures at par  beginning june   will also effect the change in the fair value of the debentures which would result from a change in interest rates 
for example  using discounted cash flow analysis  a change in interest rates calculated from december  to the first par prepayment option date for debentures would change the value of that debt by approximately  our unsecured revolving bank credit facility accrues interest at floating rates and matures in november as of december   we had million outstanding and million available for borrowing under our revolving bank credit facility 
we may make repayments under our revolving bank credit facility at any time without penalty 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility accrue interest at libor plus a margin 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  the interest rate payable on our outstanding revolving indebtedness of million at december   was per annum 
the following table presents the impact a change in interest rates would have on our floating rate interest expense at december  dollars in thousands impact of changes in interest rates interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year at december  reduction increase the foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving bank credit facility or other floating rate obligations
