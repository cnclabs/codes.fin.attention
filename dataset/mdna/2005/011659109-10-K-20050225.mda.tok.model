item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a discussion of our fuel hedging activities 
while we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability  dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production  transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel 
in the event of significant hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas  there could be reductions in the production and or 
table of contents importation of crude oil and price increases  which could adversely affect our business 
if there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel  our business would be adversely affected 
frequent flyer program all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty 
alaska s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska  horizon and other participating airlines  and by using the services of non airline partners  which include a credit card partner  telephone companies  hotels  and car rental agencies 
alaska is paid by non airline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts 
with advance notice  alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms  conditions  partners  mileage credits  and award levels or terminate the program 
mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other travel industry awards 
upon accumulating the necessary mileage  members notify alaska of their award selection 
over of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon are subject to blackout dates and capacity controlled seating 
mileage plan accounts are generally deleted after three years of inactivity in that member s account 
as of december  and  alaska estimated that  and  respectively  round trip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members who have mileage credits exceeding the  mile free round trip domestic ticket award threshold 
of those eligible awards  alaska estimated that approximately of those awards would ultimately be redeemed 
for the years  and  approximately   and  round trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon 
those awards represent approximately for  for and for of the total passenger miles flown on alaska and horizon for each period 
for the years  and  approximately   and  respectively  round trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners 
for miles earned by flying on alaska and travel partners  the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated 
the incremental cost does not include a contribution to overhead  aircraft cost  or profit 
alaska also sells mileage credits to non airline partners  such as hotels  car rental agencies  and a national bank that rewards users of its credit card 
alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds  and recognizes these proceeds as revenue when the award transportation is provided on alaska or another partner airline 
the deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued and flown on alaska or horizon and as other revenue net for awards issued and flown on other airlines 
at december  and  the deferred revenue and the total liability for providing free travel on alaska and horizon and for estimated payments to partner airlines was million and million  respectively  the majority of which is deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits 
other information seasonality and other factors our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year  because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our operating income is generally lowest or loss the greatest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic and sometimes due to adverse weather conditions  generally increases in the second quarter and generally reaches its highest level during the third quarter 
the airline industry is characterized generally by low profit margins and high fixed costs  primarily for wages  aircraft fuel  debt service and rent 
the expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried and  as a result  a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline s operating and financial results 
accordingly  a minor 
table of contents shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results 
in addition to passenger loads  factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include changes in fuel  security and insurance costs  increases in personnel  marketing  aircraft ownership and other operating expenses to support our existing operation and anticipated growth  the timing and amount of maintenance expenditures  the timing and success of our growth plan as we increase flights in existing markets and enter new markets and pricing initiatives  both internal and external 
in addition  seasonal variations in traffic  various expenditures and weather affect our operating results from quarter to quarter 
given our high proportion of fixed costs  seasonality can affect our profitability from quarter to quarter 
many of our areas of operations experience inclement weather conditions in the winter  causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft  canceled flights and accommodating displaced passengers 
due to our geographic area of operations  we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than some of our competitors particularly in the state of alaska and in the pacific northwest  who may be better able to spread weather related risks over larger route systems 
the results of operations in the air transportation business have also significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general economic conditions 
fare initiatives  fluctuations in fuel prices  labor actions and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern 
no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers 
consequently  the loss of our largest few customers would not have a materially adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
insurance we carry insurance for passenger liability  property damage and hull insurance for damage to our aircraft  in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice 
as a result of the events of september   aviation insurers have significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for third party liability for claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events 
at the same time  they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general 
although insurance rates have declined  they are still somewhat above pre september levels and will likely remain there for the foreseeable future 
pursuant to authority granted in the air transportation safety and system stabilization act  the homeland security act of  as amended by the consolidated appropriations act   the government has offered  and we have accepted  war risk insurance to replace commercial war risk insurance through august  other government matters we have elected to participate in the civil reserve air fleet program  whereby we have agreed to make available to the federal government a certain number of aircraft in the event of a military call up 
the government would reimburse us for the use of such aircraft

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all statements in the following discussion which are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policies are forward looking statements 
please consider our forward looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report s introductory cautionary note 
there can be no assurance that actual developments will be those anticipated by us 
actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of a number of factors  some of which we cannot predict or control 
for a discussion of our risk factors  see risk factors  beginning on page general alaska and horizon operate as airlines 
however  their business plans  competition  and economic risks differ substantially 
alaska is a major airline serving primarily alaska  the us west coast  five cities on the us east coast  denver  chicago  vancouver and calgary  canada  and mexico 
it operates an all jet fleet and its average passenger trip is miles 
horizon operates both as a regional airline serving primarily the pacific northwest  california  and western canada  and as a contract service provider to frontier airlines  operating as frontier jetexpress out of denver 
horizon operates both jet and turboprop aircraft  and its average passenger trip is miles 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  beginning in  horizon began operating regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress under an agreement with frontier airlines  which is described in more detail below 
year in review and current events overall  economic conditions in improved over the industry generally enjoyed increases in both passenger traffic and load factors  and alaska and horizon were no different posting record monthly load factors for much of the year 
however  ticket yields continued to remain under pressure in the wake of growth of low cost carriers such as southwest and jetblue and excess capacity in many markets 
fuel prices reached record highs during much of the year  although moderated somewhat in the fourth quarter  but are still materially above historical averages 
these factors  coupled with the high cost structures of many major carriers  resulted in another year of significant losses for the industry 
during  the management team at alaska was actively focused on cost reductions 
our stated goal for was to achieve a unit cost excluding fuel and significant items of cents per available seat mile asm and we achieved a full year unit cost excluding fuel and significant items of cents per asm 
restructuring charges during the third quarter of  alaska announced a management reorganization and the closure of its oakland heavy maintenance base  contracting out of related heavy maintenance  contracting out of the company s fleet service  ground support equipment and facility maintenance functions  maintenance shops and other initiatives 
in total  we believe these restructuring activities will result in a reduction of approximately employees when fully implemented in the first half of severance and related costs associated with this restructuring are estimated at million  of which million was recorded during the third quarter of and million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
we expect savings from these job related initiatives to be approximately million per year when fully implemented 
as part of our ongoing cost saving initiatives  we continue to look at all aspects of our business 
in  we may outsource other activities or initiate other restructuring activities which would result in further restructuring charges 
labor costs and negotiations alaska airlines continues to pursue the restructuring of its labor agreements so that they are in line with what we believe to be the market 
our objectives as we restructure these agreements are to achieve market 
table of contents labor costs  productivity and employee benefit costs 
based on these three objectives  in alaska targeted million per year of labor savings 
as a result of increases in our wage rates since that time  combined with labor cost decreases achieved by our competitors  we believe that our wages and benefits are now above market by approximately million 
alaska believes that its pilot labor costs represent the majority of this amount 
despite ongoing negotiations in late and much of  we were unable to reach a new agreement with the air line pilots association alpa and have therefore submitted to binding arbitration  the decision of which will be effective in may the arbitration will cover wages plus five issues submitted by each of the company and alpa 
the pilot labor contract contains market related standards for wages and benefits 
nevertheless  we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding  particularly whether the arbitrator s award will reflect cost savings in wage rates  productivity and benefits equal to what we consider to be the current excess over market 
reducing labor costs and finalizing the agreements with our labor groups is an important objective for mark to market fuel hedging gains beginning in the second quarter of  we lost the ability to defer  as a component of comprehensive income  recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on our fuel hedge contracts until the hedged fuel is consumed 
we lost this ability because the price correlation between crude oil  the commodity we use to hedge  and west coast jet fuel fell below required thresholds 
for more discussion  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the implications of this change are twofold first  our earnings are more volatile as we mark our entire hedge portfolio to market each quarter end and report the gain or loss in other non operating income or expense  even though the actual consumption will take place in a future period 
second  to a large extent  the impact of our fuel hedge program will not be reflected in fuel expense 
for example  we recorded gains from settled fuel hedges totaling million during  but only million of that gain is reflected as an offset to fuel expense with the balance reported in other non operating income 
we have provided information on mark to market gains or losses  as well as calculations of our economic fuel cost per gallon on pages through we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices 
impairment of c aircraft in june  the company s board approved a plan to accelerate the retirement of its boeing c fleet and remove those aircraft from service earlier than initially planned 
in july  the company announced its plan to replace these aircraft by modifying five existing aircraft and using other existing aircraft for the remaining passenger capacity 
at december  the planned modifications have been delayed 
however  management currently believes that all s will still be retired by the end of as planned 
the company expects to replace the s with boeing aircraft in and as a result of this decision  the company evaluated impairment as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and concluded that the carrying value of the c fleet was no longer recoverable when compared to the estimated remaining future cash flows 
accordingly  during the second quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge totaling million pre tax to write down the fleet to its estimated fair market value 
in addition  we revised our estimates of the useful lives and residual values of the fleet and related spare equipment and will depreciate the remaining carrying values through  when the last aircraft will be retired 

table of contents navigation fee refund during the third quarter of  we received a refund totaling million pre tax from the mexican government related to navigation fees paid in and approximately million of the refund was recorded as a reduction to operating expenses and million was recorded as non operating income 
frontier jetexpress on january   horizon began operating regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress under a year agreement with frontier airlines 
service under this agreement became fully operational during the second quarter of and horizon is currently operating nine regional jet aircraft under the frontier jetexpress brand 
flying under this agreement represented of horizon s capacity and of passenger revenues 
for the fourth quarter which is more representative of ongoing operations  flying under this agreement represented of horizon s fourth quarter capacity and of passenger revenue 
the arrangement with frontier provides for reimbursement of costs plus a base mark up and certain incentives 
however  since horizon is not responsible for many of the typical costs of operations such as fuel  landing fees  marketing costs and station labor and rents and combined with longer trip lengths  revenue per asm  cost per asm and cost per asm excluding fuel for this flying is significantly lower than horizon s native network flying 
other events during the fourth quarter of  alaska entered into a year power by the hour engine maintenance agreement with a third party 
under terms of this arrangement  the third party will provide routine and major overhaul maintenance services on certain engines in our fleet at an agreed upon rate per hour flown 
during the fourth quarter  alaska added a row of seats to its fleet 
this change will result in an increase of approximately in available seat miles on an annualized basis 
we expect this change will represent a significant portion of our capacity growth in in late  we also announced that we would be installing winglets on our b aircraft 
outlook for  alaska and horizon expect capacity increases of approximately and  respectively 
the expected capacity increase at alaska is due largely to the annualization of the additional seats added to the b fleet and the addition of three b s offset by the retirement of two b s 
horizon s expected capacity increase is due largely to the annualization of aircraft additions in the first half of  the addition of one new crj  higher utilization resulting from the annualization of the contract flying for frontier 
in addition  horizon will be adding a row of seats to the q fleet increasing capacity from to seats 
when complete  this will result in an increase of approximately in available seat miles on an annualized basis 
results of operations compared with our consolidated net loss for was million  or per share  versus net income of million  or per share  in the results include four significant items which impact the comparability to these items are discussed in the year in review and current events section beginning on page our results also include million million for alaska and million for horizon  or a combined million net of tax or per share received related to assistance from the government under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act 
our consolidated operating loss for was million compared to a loss of million for our consolidated pre tax loss for was million compared to pre tax income of million for 
table of contents financial and statistical data comparisons for alaska and horizon are shown on pages and  respectively 
on pages through  we have included a reconciliation of reported non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
alaska airlines revenues operating revenues increased million  or  during as compared to the same period in the increase in revenues resulted from an increase in passenger traffic  offset by a decline in ticket yields 
for the year ended december   capacity increased as compared to the capacity increases are primarily due to the annualization and expansion of our transcontinental flying  including service from seattle to chicago and los angeles to reagan national in washington dc 
the traffic increase of outpaced the capacity increase of  resulting in an increase in load factor from to 
the decline in yield per passenger mile was a result of continued industry wide pricing pressure  particularly in the fourth quarter where yield declines were more substantial  dropping compared to the fourth quarter of we expect that load factors will continue to be strong but that yields and passenger unit revenues will continue to decline on a year over year basis into the first half of freight and mail revenues increased million  or  because of a new mail contract we have in the state of alaska offset by lower freight revenues 
other net revenues increased million  or  due largely to revenues received from an agreement with pen air to provide flight services to dutch harbor that began in january of and higher mileage plan revenues 
alaska airlines expenses for the twelve months ended december   total operating expenses increased million  or  as compared to the same period in operating expenses per asm increased from cents in to cents in the increase in operating expenses per asm is due largely to significant increase in fuel costs  our restructuring charges  the impairment charge related to our boeing fleet  higher wages and benefits  contracted services costs and landing fees and other rental costs offset by declines in other selling expenses and commissions and the navigation fee recovery 
operating expense per asm excluding fuel  the navigation fee recovery  restructuring and impairment charges decreased to cents per asm compared to cents per asm in explanations of significant period over period changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows wages and benefits increased million  or  during approximately two thirds of the increase reflects higher pilot wages  substantially all of which is due to the wage rate increase in may under the terms of our existing union contract 
wages were favorably impacted by the restructuring initiatives announced in august and september 
during  there were  ftes  which is down by approximately ftes from on a increase in capacity 
our current plan is for approximately  ftes in benefits costs were favorably impacted by a million reduction in workers compensation expense resulting from positive workers compensation claims experience at alaska and a related reduction to ultimate loss estimates recorded in december totaling million 
in total  benefits costs were flat year over year 
beginning in  wages and benefits will include stock based compensation associated with options granted to certain employees 
based on recent history  stock based compensation expense associated with option grants is expected to be approximately to million per year pre tax 
since fas r is effective for interim periods beginning after june  our third quarter  we expect that only half that amount will be recorded in contracted services increased million  or  due largely to expenses associated with an agreement with penair to provide flight services to dutch harbor that began in january of  costs associated with a temporary charter contract we have for our new mail contract in alaska and higher 
table of contents security costs  partially offset by million from the recovery in of disputed mexico navigation fees paid in and aircraft fuel increased million  or  due to a increase in the gaap fuel cost per gallon and a increase in fuel gallons consumed 
the increase in aircraft fuel expense is inclusive of million of gains from settled hedges 
during  alaska also realized million of hedge gains which are recorded in other non operating income 
after including all hedge gains recorded during the year  our economic fuel expense increased million  or  over our economic fuel cost per gallon increased from cents to cents 
aircraft maintenance decreased million  or  due largely to fewer engine overhauls during and a change in the mix of heavy maintenance versus routine maintenance 
we plan to change the accounting for engine and airframe overhauls at alaska and horizon  effective january under the new method  we will charge the costs of these overhauls directly to expense  as opposed to our current practice of capitalizing and amortizing them 
to effect this change  we will write off the unamortized portion of previously capitalized overhauls in january as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
we expect the one time charge to be approximately million  after tax 
aircraft rent decreased million  or  due to lower rates on extended leases and fewer leased aircraft in compared to other selling expenses and commissions decreased million  or  due to a decline in the incentive payments made to horizon offset by increases in booking fees  credit card fees  and commissions

table of contents horizon air revenues for the year ended december   operating revenues increased million  or as compared to this increase is due largely to the increased traffic in our native network and our new contract flying for frontier airlines  which began january   partially offset by a decline in the incentive payments made by alaska to horizon 
incentive payments are eliminated in consolidation 
the arrangement with frontier provides for reimbursement of expected costs plus a base mark up and certain incentives 
however  since horizon is not responsible for many of the typical costs of operations such as fuel  landing fees  marketing costs and station labor and rents  revenue per asm  cost per asm and cost per asm excluding fuel for this flying is significantly lower than horizon s native network flying 
for the twelve months ended december   capacity increased and traffic was up  compared to the same period in contract flying with frontier represented approximately of passenger revenues and of capacity  during passenger load factor increased percentage points to 
passenger yield decreased to cents  reflecting the inclusion of the frontier contract flying  the yield for which is significantly lower than native network flying  and a decline in incentive payments from alaska for feed traffic 
contract revenue and higher yields in horizon s native network combined with the increases in traffic  resulted in an increase in passenger revenue of million  or horizon air expenses operating expenses increased million  or  as compared to the same period in operating expenses per asm including fuel and the impairment charge decreased as compared to operating expenses per asm excluding fuel and the impairment charge decreased as compared to the same period in operating expenses in include million related to an impairment charge on our held for sale f aircraft and spare engines to lower the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value

after including all hedge gains recorded during the year  our economic fuel expense increased million  or  over our economic fuel cost per gallon increased from cents to cents 
aircraft maintenance expense increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in block hours  a higher number of routine maintenance activities and engine overhauls for the q fleet and fewer aircraft covered by warranty 
we expect aircraft maintenance expense to decline somewhat in based on the timing of expected maintenance activities 
aircraft rent increased million  or  reflecting the annualization of aircraft added during and the addition of spare engines during landing fees and other rentals increased million  or 
higher landing fees are a result of higher rates associated with modest volume growth  an increase in airport fees and increased costs for security

cumulative effect of accounting change effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this statement  goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is tested for impairment on a minimum of an annual basis 
during the second quarter of  we completed the first step of our impairment test related to our million of goodwill 
the test was performed using alaska and horizon as separate reporting units 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the second step of our impairment test and determined that all of our goodwill was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a one time  non cash charge  effective january   of million million alaska and million horizon to write off all of our goodwill 
this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations for critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
see note to consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 
mileage plan our mileage plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on alaska or horizon and our travel partners 
additionally  we sell miles to third parties  such as our credit card partner  for cash 
in either case  the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on alaska  horizon  or any of our alliance partners 
as long as the mileage plan is in existence  we have an obligation to provide this future travel  therefore  for awards earned by passengers who fly on alaska  horizon or our travel partners  we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation 
for miles sold to third parties  a majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation 
table of contents is provided 
the deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on alaska or horizon  and as other net revenue for awards issued and flown on other airlines 
at december   we had approximately billion miles outstanding  resulting in an aggregate liability of million 
the liability is computed based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate 
there are uncertainties inherent in estimates  therefore  an incorrect assumption impacts the amount and or timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses 
the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 
the number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel 
therefore  based on the number of mileage plan accounts and the miles in the accounts  we estimate how many miles will never be used breakage  and do not record a liability for those miles 
our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members accounts  account balances  and other factors 
we believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable 
a hypothetical change in our estimate of breakage currently in the aggregate has approximately a million affect on the liability 
however  actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates given the dynamic nature of the program and our inability to predict our member s future behavior 
the number of miles used per award ie  free ticket we estimate how many miles will be used per award 
if actual miles used are more or less than estimated  we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense 
our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical redemptions on alaska  horizon or other airlines 
the costs which will be incurred to carry the passenger when the frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket  incremental costs such as food  fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger 
we estimate what these costs excluding any contribution to overhead and profit will be and accrue a liability 
if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket  we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger 
the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger 
we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly 
the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued  and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 
redemption on alaska or horizon versus other airlines the cost for alaska or horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines 
we estimate the number of awards which will be redeemed on alaska or horizon versus other airlines and accrue the costs on this based on our estimate of historical redemption patterns 
if the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated  we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 
the rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles we defer an amount that represents our estimate of the value of a free travel award 
as fare levels change  our deferral rate changes  which may result in more or less recognition of cash proceeds in any given quarter 
we review all mileage plan estimates each quarter  and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary 
any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents pension plans we account for the defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
pension expense calculated under sfas no 
is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
at december   the fair value of our pension plan assets totaled million 
we anticipate making a cash contribution of approximately million during pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases 
at december   we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long term rate of return of 
this rate is equal to the assumed rate of used at december   and was developed by evaluating input from consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions 
we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as considered appropriate 
this expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december  is based on an allocation of us equities and us fixed income securities 
decreasing the expected long term rate of return by from to would increase our estimated pension expense by approximately million 
pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of and at december  and  respectively 
the discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high quality long term bonds 
decreasing the discount rate by from to would increase our accumulated benefit obligation at december  by approximately million and increase estimated pension expense by approximately million 
the defined benefit plan for management personnel was closed to new entrants in we are working to restructure the defined benefits plans for other labor groups 
any such change could impact future pension expense and pension liabilities 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 
long lived assets as of december   we had approximately billion of property and equipment and related assets 
in accounting for these long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the long lived assets condition  and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
in  and  due to volatile economic conditions and indications of declining aircraft market values  we evaluated whether the book value of our aircraft was impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
no impairment was necessary based on the results of the evaluations except as related to the b c fleet and horizon s idle fokker f aircraft and spare engines as described above 
see page there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test 
if cash flows do not materialize as estimated  there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate  or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future 

table of contents workers compensation and employee health care accruals the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for workers compensation claims and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
restructuring accruals during the third quarter of  alaska announced a management reorganization and the closure of its oakland maintenance base  contracting out of the related heavy maintenance  contracting out of the company s fleet service ground  support equipment and facility maintenance functions and other initiatives 
total severance and related costs associated with this restructuring are estimated at million 
our severance package offered to impacted employees included cash payments based on years of service and one year of medical coverage after severance date 
since alaska self insures for employee medical coverage  we estimated the projected claims cost for affected employees and recorded a corresponding accrual 
actual experience will likely differ from the estimate if employees accept positions with other employers and no longer need the coverage provided by alaska or simply submit claims during the one year period that are higher or lower than our estimate 
we expect to adjust this accrual quarterly throughout realizability of deferred tax assets the company has a net deferred tax liability of million at december   which includes gross deferred tax assets of million offset by a gross deferred tax liability of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
based on the available evidence  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would be realizable and thus no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december  our conclusion is based on the expected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and does not rely on future taxable income 
should we incur additional losses in the future  our ability to realize the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to greater uncertainty 
we will continue to reassess the need for a valuation allowance during each future reporting period 
liquidity and capital resources the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 
december  december  change in millions  except per share and debt to capital amounts cash and marketable securities working capital long term debt and capital lease obligations shareholders equity book value per common share long term debt to capital na long term debt to capital assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent na during the year ended december   our cash and marketable securities increased million to million 
this increase reflects cash provided by operating activities of million  offset by cash used in financing activities of million  cash used for property and equipment additions of million and net purchases of marketable securities of million

cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was million during  compared to million in we had net purchases of million of marketable securities and million for property and equipment 
during  our aircraft related capital expenditures decreased million as compared to  reflecting a reduction in spending for new aircraft and capitalized overhauls 
beginning january   we will have no capital expenditures related to overhauls as those maintenance activities will be expensed as incurred under our maintenance accounting policy that will be adopted on that date 
cash provided by used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million during compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million during debt issuances during of million were secured by flight equipment 
these debt issuances have interest rates that vary with the london interbank offered rate libor and payment terms ranging from to years 
debt issuances during the period were offset by normal long term debt payments of million and full repayment of our credit facility of million 
in  we completed the private placement of million of floating rate senior convertible notes 
we plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through cash flow from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand at december  totaling million 
we also have restricted cash of million  which is intended to collateralize interest payments due in the next two years on our million floating rate senior convertible notes due issued in bank line of credit facility during  alaska paid off its million credit facility and  on december   that facility expired 
management is currently negotiating a replacement facility and expects to close the new facility during the first quarter of  although there can be no assurance that this can be accomplished on terms acceptable to us 
the million credit facility that expired in december contained contractual restrictions  required maintenance of specific levels of net worth  maintenance of certain debt and leases to net worth  leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  and limits on investments  lease obligations  sales of assets  and additional indebtedness 
such provisions also limited the amount of funds alaska airlines can distribute via dividend to alaska air group 
the notes did not restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to enter into additional agreements limiting or prohibiting the distribution of earnings  loans or other payments to alaska air group 
as noted above  we are currently negotiating with a replacement facility and hope to have that agreement completed by the end of the first quarter 
we expect that the new line of credit facility will be at least as restrictive as the prior credit facility 
convertible notes in  alaska air group completed the private placement of million of floating rate senior convertible notes due in pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
net proceeds from the offering were million  of which million was used to acquire us government securities to fund the first three years of interest payments 
in  we made a capital contribution to alaska airlines of the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the notes 
alaska airlines has used the remaining proceeds from the notes for working capital requirements and expects in the future to continue to use these remaining proceeds for working capital requirements as well as other general corporate purposes 
although we have not yet determined how each payment of principal or interest due will be funded in the future  we anticipate that 
table of contents these payments will be funded either by dividends  distributions  loans  advances or other payments from our subsidiaries or through new borrowings or financings by alaska air group 
any such payments by our subsidiaries to air group could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 
the holders of the million of floating rate senior convertible notes due in may elect to have the company redeem all or a portion of the notes on the th  th and th anniversaries of the date of issuance 
on september   we entered into the first supplemental indenture with respect to the notes to rescind the company s right to pay for such a repurchase of the notes at the option of the holders  in whole or in part  in shares of our common stock 
pursuant to the terms of the notes  as amended  any such repurchases shall be paid for in cash

the company will assess the impact of paragraphs of eitf once the guidance has been finalized 
at december   available for sale investments in the company s marketable securities portfolio had unrealized losses totaling million which are recorded in other accumulated comprehensive income 
management does not believe that the securities with unrealized losses as of december  meet the criteria for recognizing the loss under existing other than temporary guidance

fin  as amended by fin revised in december  requires consolidation of certain types of entities in which the company absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
these entities are called variable interest entities 
the principal characteristics of variable interest entities are an insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity s expected losses  equity owners as a group are not able to make decisions about the entity s activities  and equity that does not absorb the entity s losses or receive the entity s residual returns 
variable interests are contractual  ownership or other monetary interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity s net asset value 
as a result  variable interest entities can arise from items such as lease agreements  loan arrangements  guarantees or service contracts 
if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity  the entity must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable interests that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses or receives a majority of the entity s residual returns in the event no holder has a majority of the expected losses 
there is no primary beneficiary in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns 
the determination of the primary beneficiary is based on qualitative aspects of the arrangements involved or projected cash flows at the inception of the transaction with the variable interests entity 

table of contents fin was applicable to financial statements of companies that have interests in special purpose entities  as defined  during the year ended we are the lessee in a series of operating leases covering our leased aircraft 
in many instances  the lessors are trusts established by a third party specifically to purchase  finance and lease aircraft to us 
these leasing entities meet the criteria for variable interest entities 
however  they do not meet the consolidation requirements of fin because we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity s expected gains or losses 
our conclusions are based on the fact that the leasing arrangements involved contain terms which are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include residual value guarantees made by us  fixed price purchase obligations or similar features that obligate us to absorb the majority of expected losses of the variable interest entities 
our maximum exposure under these types of lease arrangements is the remaining lease payments  which are reflected in future lease commitments in note plus the cost  if any  of bringing the equipment into compliance with the physical condition required for return 
effect of inflation inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues  operating expenses and operating income 

table of contents risk factors our operations and financial results are subject to various uncertainties  such as global and industry instability  intense competition  volatile fuel prices  a largely unionized labor force  the need to finance large capital expenditures  government regulation  potential aircraft incidents and general economic conditions 
if any of the following occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could also decline 
the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change 
we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines with greater financial resources or lower operating costs  or to adjust rapidly enough in the event the basis of competition in our markets changes 
the airline industry is highly competitive as to fares  flight frequency  frequent flyer benefits  routes and service 
the industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats 
we currently compete with one or more other airlines on substantially all of our routes 
many of these airlines are larger and have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than our company 
others are operating under bankruptcy court protection and run lower costs more quickly than we can 
some of these competitors have chosen from time to time to add service  reduce their fares  or both  in our markets 
we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve 
our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets  including seattle  portland  los angeles and anchorage 
significant portions of our flights occur to and from our seattle hub 
in  this traffic to and from seattle accounted for of total traffic 
we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel  aircraft and ground operations  as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in these regions 
as a result  we remain highly dependent upon our key markets 
our business would be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets  such as adverse changes in local economic conditions  negative public perception of a key market and significant price increases linked to increases in airport access costs and fees imposed on passengers 
an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that harm our operating results 
many airlines  including ours  have code share and frequent flyer marketing alliances with other airlines 
internet distribution arrangements either in conjunction with other airlines or with independent travel websites have become an important means for selling airline travel 
any consolidation or significant alliance activity within the airline industry  or our loss of key alliance or distribution relationships  could result in our competitors having access to increased route networks and resources  which  in turn  would increase the risks of competition described above 
the airline industry  particularly the regional airlines  also faces competition from ground transportation alternatives  such as the bus  train or automobile 
video teleconferencing and other methods of electronic communication may add a new dimension of competition to the industry as business travelers seek lower cost substitutes for air travel 
our business  financial condition  and results of operations are substantially exposed to the current high prices and variability of jet fuel 
further increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 
fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses  comprising of total operating expenses for the year ended december  significant increases in fuel costs during have negatively impacted our results of operations 
further increases would harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we estimate that during the year ended december  and during the year ended december  a one cent increase in the price per gallon of fuel would have increased our fuel expenses by million and million  respectively 
average economic fuel prices which include the benefits of our hedging program during were cents higher than in total fuel costs  net of the benefit received from fuel hedges settled during the period were million higher in compared to 
table of contents historically  fuel costs have been unpredictable and subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand 
fuel availability is also subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for both home heating oil and gasoline 
because of the effect of these events on the price and availability of fuel  the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
in the event of a fuel supply shortage  higher fuel prices or the curtailment of scheduled service could result 
some of our competitors may have more leverage in obtaining fuel 
we may be unable to offset increases in the price of fuel through higher fares 
we utilize our fuel hedges as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices 
to hedge our exposure to fuel price fluctuations  we began purchasing hedging instruments  primarily instruments that cap the price paid 
at december   we had fuel hedge contracts in place to hedge of our anticipated fuel consumption in and and of our anticipated fuel consumption in and  respectively 
even with hedges  we are substantially exposed to increases in jet fuel costs 
if we are unable to meet our cost reduction goals  our results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
we  along with other airlines  have announced aggressive cost reduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while at the same time achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital 
we believe having a lower cost structure better positions us to be able to grow our business and take advantage of market opportunities 
we have implemented initiatives that we believe will reduce our annual operating costs by approximately million and seek additional savings of approximately million  the majority of which is being sought from our labor groups and  to a lesser extent  additional cost reductions in ticket distribution  maintenance  and other costs 
we hope to achieve labor savings through a combination of market based wage adjustments  a common health and retirement benefits package for every work group  and work rule changes focusing on greater efficiency in operations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement changes in our operations sufficient to generate this level of additional targeted savings  or that if such changes are implemented  that forecasted savings will be achieved 
in the event that we are unable to achieve our cost reduction goals  or our efforts prove less successful than those of our competitors  our results of operations will likely be below our own expectations and may be below those of outside financial analysts  and our financial condition may be harmed 
many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
a failure to negotiate new agreements  or to do so on terms competitive with the labor costs and practices of our competitors  could disrupt our business and increase our costs 
as of december   labor unions represented of alaska s and of horizon s employees 
labor costs generally are a significant component of our total expenses  comprising approximately of our total operating expenses in each of our different employee groups has separate collective bargaining agreements  and may make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability 
at december  we were in contract talks with most labor groups and had submitted to binding arbitration with the airline pilots association alpa 
the degree to which we meet our overall labor savings goals will be determined to a large extent by the results of the pilot arbitration 
the pilot contract provides that  if an agreement on the entire contract was not reached by december   ten contract issues plus wage rates would be submitted to an interest arbitrator 
issues submitted generally relate to pension plans  medical insurance  profit sharing  code sharing and work rules 
the parties did not reach an agreement  and the issues have been submitted to binding arbitration in march with a decision to be effective in may the pilot labor contract contains market related standards for wages and non wage issues 
if we were unable to reach agreement on the terms of any collective bargaining agreement with any group of our employees or were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction  we could be subject to work 
table of contents slowdowns or stoppages 
we could also become subject to protests or picketing by organized labor groups representing our employees 
any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could harm our business 
in the event any agreement we reach with an organized labor group requires us to pay wages or to incur costs that are materially higher than those we currently pay or we are unable to fully offset such increased costs through fare increases  our expenses would increase and our operating margin would be harmed 
weakness in the general economy  and in the airline industry in particular  could have an adverse effect on our business 
we believe that airline traffic  including business traffic  is particularly sensitive to changes in economic growth and expectations 
weak economic growth in through the first half of  low ticket yields  and escalating fuel prices contributed to much of the airline industry suffering significant losses from through currently  us airways  united airlines and ata airlines  as well as other carriers  operate under bankruptcy protection 
because airlines operating under bankruptcy protection receive increased flexibility to reduce their costs by voiding contracts and renegotiating existing business obligations  current and future airline bankruptcies could have a substantial impact on industry competition 
in the event airlines who have received bankruptcy protection choose to apply some or all of the cost savings they obtain toward reduced fares  bankruptcy by airlines who compete with us may cause us to reduce our fares and result in a substantial reduction in revenue and operating margin 
continued weakness in the airline industry may also result in additional industry consolidation  greater reliance on industry alliances  such as code sharing and frequent flyer reciprocity arrangements  and increased price competition among existing carriers  each of which could dramatically alter the competitive environment in the markets we serve and harm our operating results 
continued weak economic performance in the airline industry may also result in a further reduction in our credit rating and make it more difficult for us to raise capital on economical terms 
any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of a soft economy would harm our business 
we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and any failure of these systems could harm our business 
we depend on automated systems to operate our business  including our computerized airline reservation system  our telecommunication systems and our website 
we also issue a substantial number of our tickets to passengers as electronic tickets 
we depend on our computerized reservation system to be able to issue  track and accept these electronic tickets 
in order for our operations to work efficiently  our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight information 
substantial or repeated website  reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline 
any disruption in these systems could result in the loss of important data  increase our expenses and generally harm our business 
increases in government taxes and fees could reduce demand for air travel and harm our business airlines pay or are responsible for collecting a number of different taxes and fees including  but not limited to  fuel taxes  airport facility charges  immigration fees  security fees  excise taxes on ticket sales  and fuel taxes 
recently  the united states department of homeland security proposed raising the aviation security fee from per one way segment to per one way segment 
we believe the demand for air travel is highly sensitive to fare levels 
although law makers may impose additional fees and view them as pass through costs  we believe that a higher total ticket price in the eyes of the consumer will influence their purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic  which would harm our business 
moreover  we believe that the impact of higher fees is proportionally greater for low fare carriers  carriers with a high percentage of leisure travelers  and carriers that fly relatively short segments 
because alaska 
table of contents carriers many leisure travels and horizon flies many short haul segments  we believe higher security fees and other fee increases generally could negatively impact air group more than some of our competitors 
the september  terrorist attacks negatively impacted our industry and our business and further threatened or actual terrorist attacks  or other hostilities involving the us  may significantly harm our industry and our business in the future 
the terrorist attacks of september  and their aftermath have negatively impacted the airline industry  including our company 
because a substantial portion of our costs are fixed in the short term  we were unable to offset the reduction in customer demand through cost savings  and operating results were harmed to a proportionately greater degree 
additional terrorist attacks  the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative impact on the airline industry  including us  and could result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the faa  significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields due to a potentially dramatic drop in demand for air travel  increase security and insurance costs  increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices  make it more difficult for us to obtain war risk or other insurance  and increase costs from airport shutdowns  flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats 
our insurance costs have increased as a result of the september  terrorist attacks  and further increases in insurance costs would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
following the september  terrorist attacks  aviation insurers dramatically increased airline insurance premiums and significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance available to airlines for third party claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events to million per event and in the aggregate 
in light of this development  under the air transportation safety and stabilization act  the homeland security act of  as amended by the consolidated appropriations act of  the government is currently offering domestic airlines either i third party liability war risk coverage above million  or ii in lieu of commercial war risk insurance  full hull  comprehensive and third party liability war risk coverage 
this coverage provides for the same limits of hull and comprehensive insurance and twice the limits of third party liability insurance carried by the airline on september  aviation insurers could increase their premiums even further in the event of additional terrorist attacks  hijackings  airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry 
furthermore  the full hull  comprehensive and third party war risk insurance provided by the government is mandated through august  while the government may extend the deadline for when it will stop providing such coverage  we cannot be certain that any extension will occur  or if it does  how long the extension will last 
it is expected that  should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry  the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government 
significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 
airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements  both domestically and internationally  that involve significant compliance costs 
in the last several years  congress has passed laws  and the dot and the faa have issued regulations  relating to the operation of airlines that have required significant expenditures 
additional laws  regulations  taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time 
table of contents to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel 
if adopted  these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices  reducing revenue and or increasing costs 
our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 
an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of faith in our airlines by the flying public 
in addition  we could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives  as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service 
although we believe that we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice  the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident 
substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results 
moreover  any aircraft accident or incident  even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines  could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives  which would harm our business 
our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control  including traffic congestion at airports  weather conditions and increased security measures  any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
like other airlines  our operations are subject to delays caused by factors beyond our control  including air traffic congestion at airports  adverse weather conditions and increased security measures 
delays frustrate passengers  reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs  all of which in turn affect our profitability 
during periods of fog  snow  rain  freezing rain  storms or other adverse weather conditions  flights may be canceled or significantly delayed 
due to our geographic area of operations  we believe a significant portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than many of our competitors 
cancellations or delays due to weather conditions  traffic control problems and breaches in security could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
if alaska fails to comply with financial covenants  some of its financing agreements may be terminated 
alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements 
although our million revolving credit facility expired in december  we are currently negotiating a replacement facility 
we expect this facility to have covenants that are as restrictive  if not more  than those in our recently expired agreement 
we cannot ensure that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 
alaska s inability to comply with the required financial maintenance covenants or provisions could result in default under these financing agreements and could result in a cross default under alaska s other financing agreements 
in the event of any such default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default  all amounts outstanding under the agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable 
if alaska did not have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that became due and payable  air group or alaska would have to seek additional debt or equity financing  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if such financing were not available  alaska would have to sell assets in order to obtain the funds required to make accelerated payments or risk its aircraft becoming subject to repossession  which could harm our business 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs 
our business is labor intensive  with labor costs representing approximately of our operating expenses for the year ended december  we expect salaries  wages and benefits to increase on a gross basis and that these costs could increase as a percentage of our overall costs  which could harm our business 
we compete against the major us airlines for labor in many highly skilled positions 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost  or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be 
table of contents unable to grow or sustain our business and our operating results and business prospects could be harmed 
we may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and  therefore  the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 
we rely on third party vendors for certain critical activities we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business  including airframe and engine maintenance  ground handling  fueling  catering  computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance 
as part of its cost control efforts  the reliance on outside vendors will increase 
in september  alaska airlines announced that it was sub contracting the remaining heavy aircraft maintenance that it was then performing to outside vendors 
in addition  alaska retained outside suppliers for fleet service and facilities maintenance 
in january  alaska signed an agreement with a vendor for ground handling services at seattle in the event that it does not reach an agreement with the iam representing its ramp employees 
our increased use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks 
in the event that one or more vendors goes into bankruptcy  ceases operation or fails to perform as promised  replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates  or at all 
vendor bankruptcies  unionization  regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force alaska to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms 
these events could result in disruptions in alaska s operations or increases in its cost structure 
we have incurred operating losses in each year since and may incur substantial operating losses in the future 
in addition  our quarterly results can fluctuate substantially 
for the year ended december   air group incurred an operating loss of million 
prior to that  we incurred operating losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the inability to achieve or sustain profitability may hinder our ability to honor our existing obligations as they become due  to obtain future equity or debt financing or to do so on economical terms  and to sustain and expand our business 
in addition  our quarterly results can fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors including seasonal variations in traffic  the timing of various expenditures  and weather 
because expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried  a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline s operating and financial results 
accordingly  a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results 
due to these factors  as well as other risk factors described in this form k  quarter to quarter comparisons of our results may not be good indicators of our future performance 
in addition  it is possible that in any future quarter our operating results could be below expectations of investors and any published reports or analyses regarding our company 
in that event  the price of air group s common stock could decline  perhaps substantially 
our indebtedness could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities 
we have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of indebtedness 
due to our high fixed costs  including aircraft lease commitments and debt service  a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 
as of december   we had approximately  million of indebtedness outstanding  approximately million of which was secured by flight equipment and real property 
our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for funding our growth strategy  capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital or other purposes  require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund interest payments on indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for other purposes  and 
table of contents limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including reacting to any economic slowdown in the airline industry 
in addition  we have an ongoing need to finance new aircraft deliveries  and there is no assurance that such financing will be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
horizon s results are partly dependent on frontier jetexpress  which is dependent on frontier airlines 
horizon operates regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress under a year agreement with frontier airlines that began in january currently  that flying represents approximately of horizon s total capacity and of horizon s passenger revenue 
under the arrangement  frontier airlines pays horizon the expected costs of providing the service plus a base markup 
if frontier were to have financial difficulties and find it necessary to terminate the agreement  we would have significant excess capacity that we would have to deploy elsewhere 
there can be no assurance that this excess capacity could be deployed in profitable markets and our unit operating costs would likely increase 
a downgrade in our corporate credit rating may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to make interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt 
in  air group s credit ratings were downgraded by both s p and moody s 
on march   the senior implied rating for alaska air group was downgraded from ba to b by moody s with a commensurate reduction in other ratings 
on september   standard poor s announced that it lowered the corporate credit rating from bb to bb with a commensurate reduction in other ratings 
we cannot be assured that our corporate credit ratings will not decline in the future 
if any of our ratings decline  this may indicate a decline in our business and may affect the trading prices  if any  of our common stock or convertible notes and may make additional borrowing more expensive and difficult to obtain 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have interest rate risk in our floating rate debt obligations and our available for sale marketable investment portfolio  and commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet 
we purchase jet fuel at prevailing market prices  and seek to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
we have market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jet fuel price increases 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
fuel hedging we purchase jet fuel at prevailing market prices  and seek to manage the risk of price fluctuations through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
we utilize derivative financial instruments as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices 
we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases 
at december   we had fuel hedge contracts in place to hedge million gallons of our expected jet fuel usage during  million gallons in and million gallons in this represents  and of our anticipated fuel consumption in  and  respectively 
prices of these agreements range from to per crude oil barrel 
we estimate that a increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december  would impact hedging positions by approximately million 
as of december  and  the fair values of our fuel hedge positions were million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  million of the fair value amounts and million of the fair value amounts were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets based on settlement dates for the underlying contracts 
the remaining million fair value and million fair value is reflected in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
please refer to item on pages through  as well as to note in the consolidated financial statements  for company specific data on the results of our fuel hedging program 

table of contents financial market risk we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and short term investment portfolio 
our debt obligations include variable rates  which have exposure to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rates incurred on variable rate debt during would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately million 
we also have investments in marketable securities  which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
if short term interest rates were to average more than they did in  interest income would increase by approximately basis points
