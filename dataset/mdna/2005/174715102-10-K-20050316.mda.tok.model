table of contents impact of monetary policies 
banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate earned by banks on loans  securities and other interest earning assets comprises the major source of banks earnings 
thus  the earnings and growth of banks are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally  both domestic and foreign  and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies 
the nature and timing of any future changes in such policies and their impact on the company cannot be predicted 
competition the banking business is highly competitive 
the company s market area consists principally of neshoba  newton  leake  scott  attala  lauderdale  winston and kemper counties in mississippi 
the company also competes with other financial institutions in those counties and in surrounding counties in mississippi in obtaining deposits and providing many types of financial services 
the company also competes with larger regional banks for the business of companies located in the company s market area 
all financial institutions  including the company  compete for customers deposits 
the company competes with savings and loan associations  credit unions  production credit associations  federal land banks  finance companies  personal loan companies  money market funds and other non depository financial intermediaries 
many of these financial institutions have resources many times greater than those of the company 
in addition  new financial intermediaries such as money market mutual funds and large retailers are not subject to the same regulations and laws that govern the operation of traditional depository institutions 
the company believes it benefits from a good reputation in the community and from the significant length of time it has provided needed banking services to its customers 
also  as a locally owned financial institution  the company believes it is able to respond to the needs of the community with services tailored to the particular demands of its customers 
also  as a local institution  the company believes it can provide these services faster than a larger institution 
recent changes in federal and state law have resulted in  and are expected to continue to result in  increased competition 
the reductions in legal barriers to the acquisition of banks by out of state bank holding companies resulting from implementation of the interstate act and other recent and proposed changes in banking laws and regulations are expected to continue to further stimulate competition in the markets in which the company operates  although it is not possible to predict the extent or timing of such increased competition 
currently  there are approximately fourteen different financial institutions in the company s market area competing for the same customer base 
despite these challenges  the company has not only been able to maintain its market share  but has actually increased its share in recent years 
as of june   the company s market share in its market area was approximately 
the company competes in its market for loan and deposit products along with many of the other services required by today s banking customer 
the company believes it is able to compete favorably in its markets  in terms of both the rates we offer and the level of service that we provide to our customers
