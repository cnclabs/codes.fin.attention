item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in note  industry segment information  to the consolidated financial statements 
information relating to the company s international operations is included in note  geographic area information  to the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality demand in several of the end markets served by the publishing and retail services segment is affected by advertising and consumer spending trends 
historically  the company s businesses which serve the magazine  catalog and retail and book businesses generate higher revenues in the second half of the year driven by increased advertising pages within magazines  and holiday catalog  retail and book volumes 

table of contents competition the company operates principally in the commercial print portion of the print industry  with related service offerings designed to provide customers complete solutions for communicating their messages to targeted audiences 
the environment is highly competitive in most of our product categories and geographic regions 
competition is based largely on price  quality and servicing the special needs of customers 
industry analysts believe that there is overcapacity in most commercial printing markets 
therefore  competition is intense 
in this competitive pricing environment  companies have focused on reducing costs in order to preserve operating margins 
management believes this environment will continue to lead to more consolidation within the commercial print industry as companies seek economies of scale  broader customer relationships  geographic coverage and product breadth to overcome or offset industry excess capacity and pricing pressures 
raw materials the primary raw materials the company uses in its print businesses are paper and ink 
the company negotiates with leading suppliers to maximize its purchasing efficiencies  but it does not rely on any one supplier 
the company has existing paper supply contracts to cover substantially all of its requirements through and management believes extensions and renewals of these purchase contracts will provide adequate paper supplies in the future 
ink and related materials are currently available in sufficient amounts  and the company believes that it will have adequate supplies in the future 
the company also coordinates purchasing activity at the local facility and corporate levels to increase economies of scale 
fluctuations in paper prices  however  can affect the company s operations 
prices for most paper grades increased in although the pricing environment is difficult  the company is continuing its efforts to raise its prices to cover a substantial portion of these increases  but there is no assurance that the company will be successful in passing these increases to customers 
proceeds from the sale of by products  which are treated as a reduction of cost of goods sold  are directly affected by fluctuations in the price of paper 
by product recoveries in exceeded due to higher paper prices and volumes 
the company is assessing the continued impact of the rise in the price of crude oil on fuel costs 
the company believes it will be able to pass a substantial portion of the increase in fuel prices directly to its customers in order to offset the impact of these increases 
the company does not believe that the recent increase in crude oil prices has had a material impact on the company s consolidated annual results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
however  the company cannot predict the impact that price increases in crude oil will have upon either future operating costs or customer demand and the related impact either will have on the company s consolidated annual results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
customers during the year ended december   no customer accounted for or more of the company s net sales

the company does not engage in any material research and development activities 
environmental compliance the company s overriding objectives in the environmental  health and safety areas are to create sustainable compliance and an injury free workplace 
the company believes that estimated capital expenditures for environmental controls to comply with federal  state and local provisions  as well as expenditures  if any  for its share of costs to clean hazardous waste sites that have received the company s waste  will not have a material effect on its consolidated annual results of operations  financial position or cash flows

during the third quarter of  as a result of the then pending sale of the company s package logistics business and the shutdown of momentum logistics  inc mli  management revised the company s reportable segments to eliminate the previously reported logistics segment and to combine the remaining logistics operations primarily print logistics with the company s publishing and retail services segment 
due to a change in strategic focus subsequent to the acquisition  in december the company committed to sell its peak technologies business  which was acquired in the acquisition and formerly reported in the forms and labels segment  and it is accordingly presented as a discontinued operation

outlook the environment is highly competitive in most of our product categories and geographic regions 
competition is based largely on price  quality and servicing the special needs of customers 
industry analysts believe that there is overcapacity in most commercial printing markets 
therefore  competition is intense 
rr donnelley is a large user of paper  supplied to it by its customers or bought by the company 
the cost and supply of certain paper grades used in the manufacturing process will continue to affect the company s consolidated financial results 
prices for most paper grades increased in although the pricing environment 
table of contents is difficult  the company is continuing its efforts to raise prices to cover a substantial portion of these increases  but there is no assurance that the company will be successful in passing these increases to customers 
paper prices are expected to increase again in  however  management does not foresee any supply problems 
price increases in are not expected to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated annual results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
postal costs are a significant component of our customers cost structures and postal rate changes can influence the number of pieces that the company s customers are willing to mail 
any resulting decline in print volumes mailed could have an effect on the company s financial results 
the company does not expect postal rate increases in the united states to occur until postal rate increases can enhance the value of the company s logistics business to its customers  as the company is able to improve the cost efficiency of mail processing and distribution 
the company is assessing the continued impact of the rise in the price of crude oil on fuel costs 
the company believes it will be able to pass a substantial portion of the increase in fuel prices directly to our customers in order to offset the impact of these increases 
we do not believe that the recent increase in crude oil prices has had a material impact on our consolidated annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows for the year ended however  the company cannot predict the impact that price increases in crude oil will have upon either future operating costs or customer demand and the related impact either will have on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
technological changes  including the electronic distribution of documents and data and the on line distribution and hosting of media content  present both risks and opportunities for us 
the company s businesses seek to leverage distinctive capabilities to participate in the rapid growth in electronic communications 
the company s goal remains to help its customers succeed by delivering effective and targeted communications in the right format to the right audiences at the right time 
management believes that with the company s competitive strengths  including its comprehensive service offerings  technology leadership  depth of management experience  customer relationships and economies of scale  the company can develop the most valuable solutions for its customers 
the company seeks to countervail these trends by leveraging its position and size  generating continued productivity improvements and enhancing the value the company delivers to its customers by offering products and services to improve effectiveness and reduce total delivered cost 
in addition  the company implemented a number of strategic initiatives including the restructuring and integration of operations  the expansion of internal cross selling  cost containment and reduction efforts and the disposal of non core businesses 
the company will continue to evaluate ways to reduce its cost structure and improve the productivity of its operations 
future cost reduction initiatives could include the reorganization of operations and the consolidation of facilities 
implementing such initiatives may result in future charges  which may be substantial 
management also reviews its portfolio of businesses on a regular basis to balance appropriate risks and opportunities  to maximize efficiencies and to support the company s long term strategic growth goals 

table of contents significant accounting policies and critical estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company has identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments 
although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for the majority of its products upon shipment to the customer and the transfer of title and risk of loss 
contracts generally specify fob shipping point terms 
under agreements with certain customers  custom products may be stored by the company for future delivery 
in these situations  the company receives a logistics and warehouse management fee for the services it provides 
in certain cases  delivery and billing schedules are outlined with the customer and product revenue is recognized when manufacturing is complete  title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  the order is received and there is a reasonable assurance as to collectability 
because the majority of products are customized  product returns are not significant  however  the company accrues for the estimated amount of customer credits at the time of sale 
billings for third party shipping and handling costs are included in net sales 
revenue from services is recognized as services are performed 
long term product contract revenue is recognized based on the completed contract method or percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method is used only for contracts that will take longer than three months to complete  where project stages are clearly defined and can be invoiced and where the contract contains enforceable rights by both parties 
revenue related to short term service contracts and contracts that do not meet the percentage of completion criteria is recognized when the contract is completed 
within the company s financial print business  which serves the global financial services end market  the company produces highly customized materials such as regulatory s filings  initial public offerings and mutual fund compliance communications  as well as provides edgar related services 
revenue is recognized for these services following final delivery of the printed product or upon completion of the service performed 
revenues related to the company s premedia operations  which include digital content management  photography  color services and page production  are recognized in accordance with the terms of the contract  typically upon completion of the performed service and acceptance by the customer 
with respect to the company s logistics operations  whose operations include the delivery of printed material  the company recognizes revenue upon completion of the delivery of services 
the company records deferred revenue in situations where the revenue recognition criteria outlined above is not met 
accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is reviewed for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for product and services 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding amounts utilizing information about customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
in addition  provisions are made at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable and the company s historical collection experience 
the company s estimates of the 
table of contents recoverability of amounts due could change  and additional changes to the allowance could be necessary in the future if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than the company s historical experience 
inventories the company records inventories at the lower of cost or market values 
most of the company s inventories are valued under the last in first out lifo basis 
changes in the inflation indices may cause an increase or decrease in the value of inventories accounted for under the lifo costing method 
the company maintains inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for its products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements  the company could be required to increase its inventory allowances 
inventory management remains an area of focus as the company strives to balance the need to maintain appropriate inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times versus the risk of inventory obsolescence 
goodwill and other long lived assets the company s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is based on established valuation techniques that reflect the consideration of a number of factors including valuations performed by third party appraisers 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company performs goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances  if necessary 
the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the company would perform an additional fair value measurement calculation to determine the impairment loss  which would be charged to operations 
the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company performs indefinite lived impairment tests on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances  if necessary 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant decrease in the market value of the assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators  the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
the goodwill and long lived asset impairment assessments are generally determined based on fair value techniques  including determining the estimated future discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including discount rates  are determined using the best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company might be required to record impairment charges for the assets 
certain investments in affordable housing  which are included in other noncurrent assets  are recorded at cost  as adjusted for the company s share of any declines in the fair value of the underlying properties that are deemed to be other than temporary 
the company s basis for determining fair value of the underlying properties requires applying management s judgment using a significant number of estimates 
management derives its estimates of fair value using remaining future tax credits and tax deductions to be realized and expected residual values upon 
table of contents sale or disposition of the company s ownership interests 
expected residual values are developed from industry assumptions and cash flow projections provided by the underlying partnerships and include certain assumptions with respect to operating costs  debt levels and certain market data related to the properties such as assumed vacancy rates 
should these assumptions differ from actual results in the future  the company might be required to further write down its carrying value of these investments 
commitments and contingencies the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to environmental  employment and other matters  as well as preference claims related to amounts received from customers prior to their seeking bankruptcy protection 
periodically  the company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  the company reassesses the potential liability related to pending claims and might revise its estimates 
restructuring the company records restructuring charges when management  with the appropriate level of authority  commits and approves the elimination of certain duplicative functions and the closure of certain facilities in order to reduce the company s overall cost structure 
certain restructuring costs were recognized as a cost of the acquisition because they were contemplated at the time of the acquisition and were  therefore  included in the purchase price allocation 
these restructuring charges and related liabilities are based on contractual obligations and management s best estimates at the time the charges are recorded 
the restructuring liabilities might change in future periods based on several factors that could differ from original estimates and assumptions

accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  the company s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities 
the company accrues for tax contingencies  which it believes are probable and estimable 
although management believes that its estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different from that which is reflected in the company s historical income tax provisions and accruals 
the company has recorded deferred tax assets related to domestic and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards 
limitations on the utilization of these tax assets generally apply  accordingly  management has provided a valuation allowance to reduce certain of these deferred tax assets as management has concluded that  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized 
if actual results differ from these estimates  or the estimates are adjusted in future periods  adjustments to the valuation allowance might need to be recorded 
the company has reviewed the provision in the american jobs creation act of  relating to the repatriation of foreign earnings  and based on our analysis of our business needs and strategy the company has not

pension and postretirement plans the company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience  market conditions and input from its actuaries 
the pension and postretirement obligations are measured as of september for all years presented 
the company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long term return of pension and postretirement plan assets 
the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run 
risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities  plan funded status  and corporate financial condition 
the investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments 
furthermore  equity investments are diversified across geography and market capitalization through investments in us large capitalization stocks  us small capitalization stocks and international securities 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements  periodic asset liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews 
the expected long term rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations  historical asset returns  current and expected future market conditions  risk and active management premiums 
the prospective target asset allocation percentage for both the pension and postretirement plans is approximately for equity securities and approximately for fixed income and other securities 
the expected return on plan assets assumption at september  was for the company s pension plans and for the company s funded postretirement plan 
the discount rate used at september  to measure both the pension and postretirement benefit obligations was 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate at september  would increase the pension plan s accumulated benefit obligation by approximately million 
the health care cost trend rates used in valuing the company s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual health care cost trends and consultation with our actuaries and benefit providers 
at september   the current weighted average healthcare trend rate assumption was for pre age participants and for post age participants 
the current trend rate gradually decreases to an ultimate trend rate of 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in millions accumulated postretirement benefit obligation aggregate of the service and interest cost components net postretirement benefit cost
