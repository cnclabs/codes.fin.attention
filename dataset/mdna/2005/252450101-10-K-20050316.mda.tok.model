automated laboratory systems a systems provider  dpc designs and manufactures laboratory instruments and software to automate the performance of diagnostic assays tests  facilitating rapid  accurate results  while reducing labor and reagent costs 
the company has three principal immunoassay platforms 
dpc s immulite and immulite address the needs of high volume laboratories  while the immulite and its predecessor  the immulite  serve lower volume facilities and niche markets  which include in vitro fertilization clinics  urology clinics  physician office laboratories  research laboratories and veterinary clinics 
at the end of  over  immulite systems and over  immulite systems had been shipped 
the original immulite system was first introduced in computer driven  it uses a patented solid phase wash technology and chemiluminescent detection method  which together are capable of measurements at exceptionally low concentrations  as demonstrated by dpc s state of the art third generation assays for tsh and psa key tests related to thyroid disorders and prostate cancer  respectively 
the system is highly automated with respect to sample and reagent handling  incubation  washing  and substrate addition 
dpc s immulite has the capacity for walk away processing of up to samples per hour  on a random access basis meaning that it can perform any dpc test  or combination of dpc tests  on any patient sample at any time 
in  the company ceased manufacturing the immulite and began manufacturing the immulite this system has essentially the same operational features and runs the same tests as the immulite  but it utilizes updated operating software and is capable of performing certain dilutions on board 
in addition  it has a new exterior appearance 
the immulite  dpc s next addition to the immulite family  was introduced in the third quarter of it has a throughput of up to tests per hour  offering the medium to high volume laboratory increased efficiency in streamlining its testing workload 
the immulite can run for nearly hours without having to replenish on board supplies 
this increased throughput allows dpc to participate in a higher volume segment of the market where the average reagent use per instrument exceeds that of the original immulite 
the immulite includes advanced features such as primary tube sampling and a proprietary autodilution capability 
the system can be connected to the customer s computer system for specification of the tests to be run on each sample  as well as for reporting and archiving results 
the system can also be interfaced with robotic laboratory sample handling systems 
table of contents such as the company s sample management system sms 
the sms provides customers with a bulk sample loading platform for up to samples 
this high volume sample management system improves a laboratory s workflow flexibility and productivity 
in  dpc launched a major new instrument  the immulite this instrument is similar to the immulite which continues to be marketed but reduces the time it takes to get a result from certain tests  most importantly  tests used in emergency rooms to aid in the diagnosis of cardiac conditions 
dpc also provides system and reagent service and support to its customers 
innovative service features include a remote diagnostic capability that permits dpc s service facility to access any immulite or worldwide for the purpose of diagnosing system problems and realtime service which provides the ability for an immulite to monitor itself and to proactively contact the company s service facility if it senses a potential problem 
in this way  the company may be able to solve a problem before a customer is aware that it exists 
in  dpc released the next evolution of realtime service  called realtime solutions 
this new service allows customers to use the internet to perform on line quality control and monitor systems within a specified network 
pursuant to a distribution agreement with thermo electron corporation tec  in the company obtained the right to distribute the konelab clinical chemistry systems for human clinical diagnostics and veterinary testing in spain  portugal  belgium  the netherlands and luxembourg 
in france and germany  dpc has the right to market the konelab product line when sold together with immulite systems 
dpc also has nonexclusive rights to sell tec s tc automation  a laboratory automation product line  when sold together with the immulite systems and the konelab clinical chemistry systems 
in the first quarter of  the company obtained distribution rights from medical electronic systems of israel to a sperm analyzer that dpc markets under the name spermalite sqa v 
the spermalite is a stand alone  benchtop high performance analyzer that provides rapid reliable semen analysis in less than seconds 
in  the company expects to launch an enhanced version of the sms that will connect to two immulite s or s  called the dpc immunoassay workcell 
the sms will eventually function as a universal robotic interface that can be linked to many of the workcell automated systems available on the market 
immunodiagnostic test kits dpc manufactures over immunodiagnostic test kits  exploiting several technologies and assay formats 
the company s monoclonal antibody  molecular engineering  and other basic science capabilities play key roles in optimizing these immunoassays 
chemiluminescence enhanced enzyme immunoassays are the basis for dpc s automated immulite product lines 
dpc also manufactures classic radioimmunoassays rias  based on double antibody  coated tube  and irma formats  as well as enzyme immunoassays eias in microplate format 
allergy testing uses a proprietary liquid allergen technology that is now fully automated on the immulite because of the introduction of allergy testing on the immulite  the company s microplate allergy format was discontinued at the end of some of dpc s assays are available both as manual rias and as automated immulite assays 
the automated  non isotopic product lines represent the core of dpc s business 
the immulite family of assays  instruments  and service represented   and of sales in   and  respectively  a trend that is expected to continue 
in fiscal year  dpc s rias accounted for of sales  while microplate allergy and other non immulite products accounted for 
for additional information concerning sales by product line over the last three fiscal years  see notes to consolidated financial statements note effective july   the company sold its pathodx line of manual tests to remel  inc for  the company will continue to manufacture this product line  which consists of manual tests for strep  chlamydia  herpes  respiratory virus and cytomegalovirus  through some time in breadth of menu the immulite family of systems is comprised of closed systems  they will not perform other manufacturers tests 
accordingly  a most important factor in the successful marketing of these systems is the ability to offer a broad menu of individual assays and assay groups  that is  tests which jointly represent decision making panels for various disease states  such as thyroid disorders or infertility 
many of the relevant disease states represent either high volume opportunities in the marketplace  or unique  under served conditions that allow dpc to fill a market niche 
as of december   dpc had immulite assays available  immulite assays available and immulite assays available 
dpc believes that the immulite family of systems offers one of the most extensive menus of any automated immunoassay system on the market 
the company s research and development activities continue to focus on 
table of contents expanding the menu  giving special attention to complete implementations of clinically important assay groups  as well as on developing new generations of instrumentation and software 
in february  the company was informed by the united states food and drug administration fda that it was subject to the fda s application integrity policy 
as a result  the fda will not review new test applications until the company has successfully resolved this matter 
see government regulation 
the spectrum of applications major clinical applications of dpc s immunoassays include the following areas  where dpc s extensive offerings on the immulite family of systems have enabled the company to achieve a significant presence in various types of laboratories  large and small 
thyroid disorders for many hospital and clinical reference laboratories  thyroid testing is a mainstay of their routine immunoassay work 
dpc offers a spectrum of assays for assessing and monitoring thyroid status on all of its immunoassay systems 
the menus include not only assays for free and total thyroid hormones  but also assays with third generation capability for thyroid stimulating hormone tsh and assays for thyroid autoantibodies and other relevant analytes 
the company believes that this combination represents a high quality solution for thyroid testing 
therapeutic drug monitoring tdm based on industry sources  the company believes that there is a large market for tdm assays tests for the routine monitoring of various therapeutic drugs 
many of the most frequently monitored drugs are measured by immunoassay 
dpc provides tests for carbamazepine  digitoxin  digoxin  gentamicin  phenobarbital  phenytoin  theophylline  tobramycin and valproic acid 
infertility  pregnancy dpc provides a broad spectrum of assays for reproductive hormone testing  supplemented by studies to aid in the interpretation of results and software to facilitate data manipulation  when appropriate 
some of dpc s assays reflect the special needs of fertility clinics and in vitro fertilization ivf centers 
others are important for the routine assessment of osteoporosis and hormone balance in postmenopausal women and aging men 
dpc offers an extensive menu of immunoassays for maternal and fetal diagnosis  monitoring  and risk assessment 
the company s menu relates to medical conditions in many phases of reproductive life in men  women  and children of all ages 
cancer dpc has automated a large number of assays for tumor markers on the immulite system family 
the company has a number of important offerings  including third generation assays capable of measuring the extremely low psa concentrations encountered after radical prostatectomy 
infectious diseases infectious disease testing is a growing segment of the ivd market and one that has historically been performed manually 
dpc addresses this market with a broad menu of assays  including a panel of hepatitis b assays  which is attractive to the us market  and some esoteric assays  eg for h 
pylori  an organism responsible for stomach ulcers 
allergy traditionally in vitro allergy testing has required special laboratory equipment and has been time and labor intensive  and somewhat error prone due to the lack of full automation 
with its patented liquid allergen technology  dpc believes it is one of the leading suppliers of in vitro allergy test kits 
in  the company introduced assays for selected allergy screening panels on the immulite 
in september  dpc introduced a broad spectrum of assays for individual allergens on the immulite  making it possible for laboratories to perform high volume allergy testing along with other routine immunoassays on a fully automated system 
the immulite and can provide tests for over allergens and panels  representing over of allergy requests 
as a complement to immulite allergy  dpc has developed a product line alablot of confirmatory western blotting assays 
inflammatory conditions cytokines  often referred to as hormones of the immune system  represent potentially important disease markers  which are being actively investigated in major centers throughout the world 
in europe and japan  assays for clinically relevant cytokines are already in routine use  eg for the management of bacterial sepsis blood poisoning in intensive care units 
dpc believes that it is the only company to offer a significant menu of cytokine assays in an automated format 
these tests include an automated immunoassay for lbp lipopolysaccharide binding protein  a marker of inflammation reflecting systemic exposure to gram negative bacteria  for which dpc has an exclusive license  and automated tests for the inflammatory markers il  il  il r and tnf alpha 
cardiovascular disease cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed nations and as such represents an important field of healthcare diagnostics 
on the immulite family of systems  dpc offers a comprehensive cardiac menu on a single platform 
the three principal assays required on an emergency basis due to their role in diagnosing acute myocardial infarction troponin i  ck mb  and myoglobin have been implemented on the immulite with turbo software  which reduces the assay time to fifteen minutes  along with other tests needed in an emergency room or intra operative setting hcg  pth 
the company has also implemented 
table of contents these three cardiac assays with reduced assay time on the immulite additional assays  including high sensitivity crp and homocysteine  put the company in an excellent position to address all aspects of cardiac testing  from diagnosis and patient management to risk assessment 
research and development activities the company devotes substantial resources to research and development to update and improve its existing products  as well as to develop new products and technologies 
in addition to developing and adding allergy testing capabilities to the immulite  the company s research and development activities include the development of the next generation immulite system and new versions of operating software for both the immulite and the immulite and new assays for the immulite family of systems 
r d capabilities in the united states include fully staffed departments in organic synthesis  biochemistry  antisera hybridoma  protein chemistry  molecular biology  and infectious disease  method development  instrumentation  software  and technology development 
during the years ended december   and  the company spent  and  and  respectively  on research and development 
the company is engaged in an aggressive development program for new instrument systems  all focusing on providing improved productivity for the end users 
this includes further development of sample handling devices and robotic interfaces for connections to laboratory systems to enhance the functionality of existing immulite systems  the immulite  a very high throughput immunoassay system incorporating several new technologies to deliver optimal assay performance  and the immulite  a scaled down version of the immulite in addition  the company continues to explore new potential technology applications for its business 
manufacturing and service the company s principal test kit manufacturing facility is located in los angeles  california 
approximately of test kit production is conducted at the euro dpc facility in the united kingdom 
the company s european manufacturing facilities enable the company to improve its competitiveness in the european economic area eea by minimizing import duties and freight charges 
certain ria kits are also manufactured by dpc in china 
dpc s instrument division in new jersey designs and manufactures immulite instrumentation and engages in software development

the company provides a one year warranty that covers parts and labor 
underwriter s laboratories inc ul  an internationally recognized independent standards organization  lists the immulite systems 
the company s and its distributors technical service personnel install new units  train customers in the use of the system  and provide maintenance and service for the instrumentation 
the euro dpc instrumentation division in the united kingdom manufactures certain components of the immulite and immulite instruments that are then assembled into the final instrument in new jersey 
dpc s los angeles and new jersey facilities are international standards organization iso and registered 
iso is an internationally recognized independent standards organization 
euro dpc limited  the company s wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary in wales  was the first immunodiagnostics company in the world to be registered under british standard bs and is also registered to iso and iso standards 
the china facility is registered to iso dpc provides technical support for all its products  including reagents  instruments  and software  via telephone and on site service 
in dpc introduced real time service on the immulite system and subsequently on the immulite real time service is the company s proprietary software that connects an installed immulite instrument to dpc s technical support department through a secure network connection to provide constant hour monitoring and support 
should a particular system function begin to fail or degrade  an alert will be sent to a technical support representative 
in  dpc released its realtime solutions software  a new service that allows customers to use the internet to perform on line quality control and to monitor systems within a specified network 
marketing and sales the company s customers are hospital  clinical  forensic  research  reference  and veterinary laboratories  as well as doctors offices and us government agencies 
the company markets its products in the united states directly to laboratories and hospitals through its own sales force  and also through group purchasing organizations 
the company sells to the us doctors office market through independent distributors as well as through its own sales force 
sales personnel and distributors are trained to demonstrate the company s product line in the customer s laboratory and are supported by the company s los angeles and new jersey based technical services departments 

table of contents no customer accounted for more than of consolidated revenue for any of the three years ended december   and the company s products are sold on a worldwide basis through distributors in over foreign countries 
these distributors  including affiliated distributors  also sell other manufacturer s products that are not directly competitive with the company s products 
the following chart sets forth the percentage of total sales and total net income for the last three years for each of the company s foreign geographic segments 
united ingdom german group brazilian group other percent of total sales percent of total net income includes distributors located in croatia  czech republic  poland  slovakia and slovenia 
includes distributors located in bolivia  costa rica  dominican republic  guatemala  panama  uruguay and venezuela 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information regarding foreign operations 
sales of test kits to customers and distributors are made against individual purchase orders as well as through master purchase arrangements 
products are shipped directly from the company s facilities in los angeles and wales and are generally delivered domestically within hours and overseas within hours of receipt of order 
the company sells  leases  or rents the immulite instrumentation to hospitals and reference laboratories that perform volume testing 
the company s backlog at any date is usually insignificant and not a meaningful indicator of future sales 
the company s foreign operations are subject to various risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  political and economic instability  and trade restrictions 
because the company s consolidated foreign distributors sales are in the respective local currencies  the company s consolidated financial results are affected by foreign currency translation adjustments 
in addition  the price competitiveness of the company s products abroad is impacted by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
proprietary and other rights substantially all of the company s products are based on proprietary technologies and know how 
the company holds various us and foreign patents  including patents on the washing process used in the immulite system that expire in and patents on its novel liquid based amplification methodology which forms the basis of the allergy product line which expire in the company also obtains licenses for chemical components and technologies used in certain of its assays 
the company has patents pending with us and foreign regulatory agencies 
patents that may be granted to others in the future could inhibit the company s expansion or entry into certain areas  or require it to pay royalty fees to do so 
because of rapid technological developments in the immunodiagnostic industry with concurrent extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  certain of the company s products may involve controversy concerning infringement of existing patents or patents that may be issued in the future 
the company purchases certain chemical compounds that are key components in the immulite system from lumigen  inc  the sole supplier of these chemical compounds 
the company owns a interest in lumigen  inc and accounts for this interest using the equity method because the company has the ability to exert significant influence as a result of its representation on lumigen s board of directors and because its purchases from lumigen are significant to lumigen 
the company has the non exclusive right to use these chemical compounds for the duration of the underlying patents  the last of which expires in  in return for a royalty payable to the owners of 
table of contents the patents 
the royalty is based solely on dpc s sales of diagnostic reagents which use the chemical compounds  and there is no minimum royalty due or milestones which must be achieved 
the company s business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if lumigen  inc was unable to meet the company s supply requirements 
in such an event  there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain alternative components that have the same performance characteristics or that the cost of such alternatives would not exceed the amounts charged by lumigen 
government regulation the company s business is affected by government regulations both in the united states and abroad  in particular western europe and japan  aimed at containing the cost of medical services 
these regulations have generally had the effect of inhibiting the growth rate of the immunodiagnostic industry 
the company believes that in vitro diagnostic ivd testing is an important tool for reducing health expenditures 
by providing early diagnosis and therapy management  ivd tests can reduce the high costs of hospitalization  surgery  and recovery 
in response to cost containment measures  hospitals and laboratories have consolidated and have sought to increase productivity by replacing high cost labor with automated testing systems 
the company s automated systems address these market needs 
the company also seeks to develop more rapid and sensitive tests  such as dpc s third generation tsh assay  that can eliminate the need for redundant testing 
manufacturers of immunodiagnostic tests and other clinical products intended for use as human diagnostics are governed by fda regulations as well as regulations of state agencies and foreign countries 
under fda regulations  medical devices are classified into class i  ii  or iii  depending on the level of risk and to identify the level of regulatory control that is necessary to assure their safety and effectiveness 
the classification of the device generally will determine the type of marketing authorization either pre market notification k or pre market approval pma  if any  the manufacturer must complete in order to obtain fda clearance approval to market the product 
pre market notification k is the mode employed to market class i and ii and some class iii devices intended for human use in the us  and most of dpc s products are cleared for marketing this way 
dpc must submit a k to the fda at least days before marketing a product unless the device is exempt from k requirements 
the purpose of the k submission is to demonstrate to the fda that the device to be marketed is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device for the same intended use that is not subject to pre market approval pma 
applicants must compare their k device to one or more similar devices currently on the us market and support their substantial equivalence claims with respect to intended use and product performance 
some k notifications must be supported by clinical data 
fda must notify the applicant that the k submission complies with applicable requirements before the product can be marketed 
a pma requires demonstration of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness through the submission of clinical testing and other data 
this requires an in depth review and approval by the fda as opposed to a determination of substantial equivalence 
the process typically takes about one year to complete after submission of the pma application  but can take longer 
fewer than of dpc s test kits have been subject to the pma process 
in february  the company was informed by the fda that  based on inspectional findings that included data integrity and procedural issues related solely to dpc s k application for the immulite chagas test  the company was subject to the fda s application integrity policy aip 
the fda suspended its review of all applications submitted by the company and will not review any future applications until the fda determines that the company has resolved these issues  although studies to support future applications can be conducted while on aip 
the aip may be invoked when the fda determines that there are serious questions as to the reliability of data submitted by applicants 
the aip sets forth corrective actions by which applicants may seek to restore the fda s confidence in the integrity of data in their applications and permit the agency to proceed with review of such applications 
with respect to dpc  the fda stated that in connection with the company s chagas test k application  among other things  the company had failed to properly report and monitor clinical study data and that there were record keeping deficiencies 
to address the aip issues  the company was audited by a third party  whose report has been submitted to the fda 
the company also developed and implemented a corrective action plan that was submitted to the fda 
the company has requested the fda to take any action necessary to remove it from the aip  which may include an inspection by the fda 
the company believes that the aip issues will be resolved with the fda and hopes that to occur in the next few months 
the fda s application of the aip to dpc does not restrict dpc from introducing new tests outside of the united states 
however  the company s inability to introduce new tests in the united states during the pendency of the aip may have a negative impact on future sales and profits 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the company s us manufacturing facilities and its wales facility are licensed by the fda and must be operated in conformance with the fda s good manufacturing practices gmp regulations governing medical devices 
the gmp regulations require that manufacturers of finished medical devices maintain a quality system that complies with the quality system regulation of the fda 
these regulations include controls over production  packaging  labeling  auditing  employee training  and record keeping 
fda periodically inspects device companies for compliance with the gmp regulations 
fda also regulates clinical investigations 
these regulations increase the time  difficulty and costs associated with product development and production 
the failure to comply with the fda requirements can result in delay in obtaining authorization to sell products  seizure or recall of products  suspension or revocation of authority to manufacture or sell products  and other civil or criminal sanctions 
the us manufacturing facilities are also subject to state licensing requirements 
the company is regulated by the california department of health services with respect to its possession and use of radioactive substances and by the us drug enforcement agency with respect to the use and storage of controlled drugs and pharmaceuticals 
the european union eu requires a quality system in accordance with the international quality standard iso for device manufacturers under the in vitro diagnostic medical devices directive ec the directive 
medical devices compliant under the directive may bear the ce mark for free movement and trade within the eu 
since june  the company has been qualified to apply the ce mark to most of its in vitro diagnostic test kits and instruments as mandated by the directive 
many other countries outside of the eu have accepted the ce mark to fulfill their local requirements or are developing equivalent regulations 
the united kingdom  canada and many latin american and asian countries require compliance with iso to allow access to their markets 
dpc meets and is registered to the iso standard 
competition the company s major competitors are broad based health care companies such as roche diagnostics  abbott diagnostics abbott laboratories  bayer  johnson johnson  beckman coulter  and sweden diagnostics formerly pharmacia in sweden 
the company competes on a worldwide basis with a number of large corporations that sell diversified lines of products  including immunodiagnostic products  for laboratory  medical  and hospital use 
the fact that these companies offer diversified products to the laboratories at times puts the company at a competitive disadvantage 
there are currently over domestic suppliers of immunodiagnostic kits 
the company believes that competition in immunoassay testing is based on quality  service  product convenience  and price and that product innovation is an important source for change in market share 
the principal competitive factors in automated systems are size of menu the number of assays that can be performed on the system  ease of use  and price equipment cost  service  and reagent cost 
the company s immulite system currently offers one of the widest menus of any automated system and the company is focusing its development efforts on expanding this menu 
employees as of december   the company including its consolidated subsidiaries had  employees  including in manufacturing  in research and development  in marketing and sales  and in administration 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor union  and the company considers its employee relations to be good 
the company has experienced no significant problems in recruiting qualified technical and operational personnel

overview dpc develops and manufactures automated diagnostic test systems and related reagent test kits that are used by hospital  reference  and physicians office laboratories throughout the world 
the company s principal product line  immulite  is a fully automated  computer driven modular system that uses specialized proprietary software to provide rapid  accurate test results that reduce the customer s labor and reagent costs 
our immunoassay tests provide critical information useful to physicians in the diagnosis  monitoring  management  and prevention of various diseases 
dpc manufactures immunodiagnostic test kits also called reagents or assays using several different technologies and assay formats 
the immulite instruments are closed systems  meaning that they will not perform other manufacturers tests 
accordingly  a major factor in the successful marketing of these systems is the ability to offer a broad menu of assays 
in addition to almost immulite assays  the company sells a broad range of tests based on other technologies that can be performed manually using the customer s own laboratory equipment  such as radioimmunoassay ria and enzyme immunoassay eia tests 
in addition to breadth of menu  major competitive factors for the immulite instruments include time to results how quickly the instrument performs the test  ease of use  and overall cost effectiveness 
because of these competitive factors and the rapid technological developments that characterize the industry  the company devotes approximately of its annual revenues to research and development activities  all of which are expensed as incurred 
the company s products are sold throughout the world directly and through affiliated and independent distributors 
historically  foreign sales including us export sales  sales to non consolidated subsidiaries and independent distributors  and sales of consolidated subsidiaries have accounted for more than of revenues  although  since  domestic sales growth has outpaced foreign sales growth 
the company derives revenues from two principal sources reagent test kit sales and immulite instrument placements 
the company recognizes sales of test kits upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
immulite instruments are placed with customers under many different types of arrangements that generally fall into the following categories sale  lease  reagent rental  and soft placement 
the company sells instruments directly to end users  to third party leasing companies that lease the instruments to end users  and to independent distributors that then resell the instruments to their customers 
instrument sales  which represent the smallest component of placements  are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title 
the company also places instruments under sales type leases  which are recorded as revenue upon shipment in an amount equal to the present value of the future minimum lease payments to be received over the lease term 
many instruments are placed other than by outright sale or sales type lease 
the company enters into various types of lease arrangements with customers that generally provide for terms of three to five years and periodic rental payments 
revenue on leases is recognized on a pro rata basis over the term of the lease 
when an instrument is placed on a reagent rental basis  the customer agrees to pay a mark up on reagents  but is not charged for the instrument 
the company also places instruments at no charge to the customer soft placement subject to the customer s agreement to purchase a minimum amount of reagents 
in reagent rentals and soft placements  the only revenue recognized is based on reagent shipments 
under operating lease  rental  and soft placements  dpc continues to own the instrument that is placed with the customer and the instruments come back to the company at the end of the rental or lease period 
these instruments are generally amortized on a straight line basis over five years and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
the company also enters into service contracts with customers and recognizes service revenue over the related contract life related costs are expensed as incurred 
two important indicators used by management to evaluate financial performance are instrument shipments and reagent utilization 
the number of immulite instruments that the company reports as being shipped in any period is net of instruments which come back to the company due to the end of the related lease or rental period  or in connection with a trade in on the purchase of a new model 
historically  the company has rarely experienced sales returns 
therefore  no allowance has been provided 
the company refurbishes and seeks to place instruments that come back to the company at reduced prices 
because of the different methods in which instruments are placed  total instrument sales vary from period to period based on a relative mix of placement methods  and such sales do not necessarily have a direct correlation to the number of instruments shipped during the period 

table of contents an important measure of the penetration of immulite reagent sales is the average amount of reagent sales sold per instrument shipped referred to as  reagent utilization 
it takes a number of weeks or months after an instrument is shipped for it to become fully functional with regard to reagent utilization because of the time it takes for the customer to become familiar with the operation of the instrument and all of the tests a customer can run on the instrument 
the company calculates reagent utilization for a fiscal period by dividing immulite reagent sales for the period by the total number of instruments shipped as of the end of the previous fiscal period

the total base of immulite systems shipped grew to  including  immulite and systems 
this installed base of instruments and an expanding test kit menu are expected to support continued growth in the coming years 
in  the company shipped a total of immulite systems  including immulite systems  and in the company shipped a total of  systems  including immulite systems 
in  as in the previous year  the growth of dpc s business was driven primarily by ongoing demand for the immulite and the immulite the immulite  which was launched in june  reduces the time it takes to get a result from tests  most importantly tests used by emergency rooms to aid in the diagnosis of cardiac conditions 
for this reason  although the has a higher price than the  the may erode sales of the however the two instruments are otherwise very similar and the company will continue to market the to a significant group of customers for which the faster test results are not critical  such as large reference laboratories 
the immulite and the have a longer sales process than the immulite due to the higher sales price 
the company has also experienced a longer time delay between instrument placement and the ramp up of reagent sales with the immulite and the  compared to the immulite 
included in immulite equipment sales is revenue relating to the company s sample management system sms  a sample handling device that can be attached to the immulite the increase in instrument and service revenue in was in part due to the increased number of immulite s placed and the increased number of instruments in service 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began shipping the immulite  an updated version of the immulite one together the immulite 
the number of immulites shipped has declined in the last two years due to larger customers preference for the immulite even though immulite instrument sales and service have declined  demand for the immulite continues to be strong  and the company believes that it remains an important complement to the higher throughput  state of the art immulite and the number of immulite instruments shipped may continue to decline as more refurbished systems which are not included in the total count of units shipped become available at a price lower than that of new instruments 
the increase in reagent sales is in part due to the larger installed base of instruments as well as the weakness of the us dollar 
reagent utilization on the immulite fell to  in the fourth quarter of from  in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  reagent utilization on the immulite was  the decrease in was in part caused by an  decrease in the sale of homocysteine kits  the fact that the company did not release any new assays on the immulite in  the time it takes for the significant number of instruments placed in the last year to become fully utilized  and the mix of instruments going into high volume environments 
the increase in was in part related to a larger test menu and the strength of the euro relative to the dollar 
reagent utilization on the immulite fell to  in the fourth quarter of from  in  which was up from  in although the utilization on the immulite increased in  it is expected that the utilization will decline in the future as instruments are placed in lower volume environments 
sales of the company s mature ria or isotopic products  million in  were down from million in sales in decreased from it is expected that these sales levels will decline in the future as customers move to more automated methods of testing which do not require radioactive agents 

table of contents sales of other dpc products declined to million in from million in in sales of other dpc products were million 
sales of other dpc products in fell due to the introduction of allergy testing on the immulite  which took sales away from the company s microplate based allergy tests 
the company decided to cease production of its microplate based allergy tests at the end of  resulting in a reduced amount of sales in in the third quarter of  the company sold its pathodx product line 
although the company has agreed to continue manufacturing these products  the revenue from these products declined significantly in the company s sales of other manufacturers products increased to million in from million in  which was a decrease from sales in of million 
the company announced in the fourth quarter of that it would begin distributing clinical chemistry equipment from kone  a manufacturer of clinical chemistry and automation instrumentation  in selected markets  which may increase sales of other manufacturers products in the future 
domestic sales increased in over  and in over  reflecting in part the company s continued success with larger customers and purchasing organizations and indirect distribution into smaller doctor s office laboratories 
domestic sales as a percentage of total sales were approximately in and and in foreign sales including us export sales  sales to non consolidated foreign subsidiaries  and sales of consolidated subsidiaries as a percentage of total sales were approximately in and and of sales in europe  the company s principal foreign market  represented   and of total sales in   and  respectively 
sales in the company s german subsidiary  which includes the czech republic and poland  increased to million in from million in  and million in  reflecting the success of the immulite product line 
sales in the brazil region  which includes certain other central and south american countries  accounted for approximately of total sales  or million  in  compared to million in and million in in the past  the brazilian real has been very volatile relative to the us dollar 
the exchange rate of reals to the us dollar was at the end of  at the end of  and at the end of the company has generally been able to increase prices when it has experienced significant devaluations in the real  however  it has not been able to fully offset such currency effects 
due to the significance of foreign sales  the company is subject to currency risks based on the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar 
in periods when the us dollar is strengthening  the effect of the translation of the financial statements of consolidated foreign affiliates is that of lower sales and net income 
in periods when the dollar is weakening  the impact is the reverse 
the company s greatest exposure is to the euro and the brazilian real 
based on the comparison of the exchange rates to the immediately preceding year  in the dollar weakened relative to the euro and net of the negative impact of the real the currency effect was a slight positive impact 
in  the dollar weakened relative to the euro and to the real 
the net effect was a positive impact of on sales 
in the dollar weakened relative to both the euro and the real and the effect was a positive impact of on sales 
due to intense competition  the company s foreign distributors are generally unable to increase prices to offset the negative effect when the us dollar is strong 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company discovered internally that certain senior managers and other employees of its chinese subsidiary had made certain improper payments that may have violated foreign and us laws 
beginning in the early s  the chinese subsidiary made cash payments and provided in kind benefits to hospital and laboratory customers of the chinese subsidiary and to employees of such customers 
because certain of the customers were state owned enterprises and the payments may have been for the purpose  or may have had the effect  of causing those customers to purchase products from the chinese subsidiary  these payments and benefits may have violated the us foreign corrupt practices act as well as certain domestic chinese laws 
in addition  the deduction of these payments and benefits by the subsidiary on its tax returns may have been improper under the chinese tax law  resulting in underpayments of chinese taxes 
an independent investigation by the company s audit committee concluded that no current members of the company s senior management knew of or were involved in the provision of the payments and benefits 
the company has made changes in the management of the chinese subsidiary  including replacement of the senior managers involved  and has implemented procedures and controls to address these issues and to promote compliance with applicable laws 
the company voluntarily disclosed these payment issues to the securities and exchange commission sec and the department of justice doj in the first quarter of and has been cooperating fully with these agencies in their investigations since that time 
the company s discussions with both the sec and the doj are at fairly advanced stages and include proposals that the company pay an aggregate of approximately million to those agencies  consisting of million in fines and approximately million in disgorgement of profits and related interest charges 
the proposals being discussed also include changes to the company s compliance programs  independent monitoring of and reporting on 
table of contents those programs for up months  entry of a cease and desist order and either a deferred prosecution agreement or a plea by the company s chinese subsidiary 
any settlement recommended by the staff of the sec would be subject to approval by the commission and any deferred prosecution or plea agreement would be subject to court approval 
in the fourth quarter of  the company accrued million for actual and estimated costs to resolve this matter 
in the third quarter of  the company accrued an additional million based on its revised estimates of costs that will be paid to the us government to resolve the matter 
in the fourth quarter of  the company accrued an additional million  including  in interest  based on the proposed settlements with the sec and the doj 
as of december   million remained in the accrual 
in addition  the company recorded a charge of million to its fourth quarter tax provision related to the non deductibility of the payments in china 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded an additional charge of million to its income tax provision for this and other chinese tax related matters 
legal expenses relating to this matter of approximately  and  have been incurred and charged to general and administrative expense during the years ended december  and  respectively 
it is anticipated that legal fees for issues related to china will decrease in the termination of the improper payments in china has had and may continue to have a significant adverse effect on future operations in china because such termination could negatively influence a significant number of the chinese subsidiary s customers decisions as to whether to continue to do business with that subsidiary 
for the year ended december   the chinese subsidiary had sales of million versus sales of million in in february  the company was informed by the us food and drug administration fda that  based on inspectional findings that included data integrity and procedural issues related solely to the company s application for the immulite chagas test  the company was subject to the fda s application integrity policy aip 
see item business government regulation 
the fda suspended its review of all applications submitted by the company and will not review any future applications until the fda determines that the company has resolved these issues  although studies to support future applications can be conducted while on aip 
to address the aip issues  the company was audited by a third party  whose report has been submitted to the fda 
the company also developed and implemented a corrective action plan that was submitted to the fda 
the company has requested the fda to take any action necessary to remove it from the aip  which may include an inspection by the fda 
the company hopes that the aip issues should be resolved with the fda in the next few months 
the fda s application of the aip to dpc does not restrict dpc from introducing new tests outside of the united states 
however  the company s inability to introduce new tests in the united states during the pendency of the aip may have a negative impact on its future sales and profits 
the company s brazilian subsidiary is a participant along with various other companies in a number of lawsuits against the brazilian government claiming unlawful taxation 
historically the companies involved in these suits have had limited success in having these taxes over turned 
the company has also purchased unused tax credits for approximately million from an unrelated company 
however  due to uncertainty related to the company s ability to use these credits against its tax liabilities  it has fully reserved against the cost of these credits 
these court cases typically take many years to be decided and the company estimates what its most likely loss outcome will be based on the merits of the individual cases and advice of outside counsel 
as of december   the company has accrued amounts it believes it will have to pay 
in the suit that involves the majority of the disputed taxes  in this case sales taxes  if the courts were to rule against the company in all actions  it would create an additional liability of million 
cost of sales gross margins are generally affected by product mix regents vs 
instruments  customer mix foreign vs 
domestic  and movement in foreign currencies 
gross margin in decreased to from in the decrease was due in part to a million dollar payment for a homocysteine license to cover customers historical purchases of the company s homocysteine tests  million of unabsorbed costs related to immulite manufacturing issues in new jersey which temporarily affected production of the immulite during the fourth quarter  and approximately million in inventory write downs related in part to discontinued products in particular the microplate allergy line 
gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease was due in part to an increase in manufacturing related costs and the costs of services in los angeles  decreases in sales volume and production of instruments in new jersey  price decreases on the immulite in anticipation of the release of the immulite  and decreases in china 
gross margins were positively impacted by a weakening dollar 
all products manufactured in the united states are sold in dollars  therefore  a weakening dollar could improve gross margins and a strengthening dollar could weaken gross margins 
in  the company relocated its brazilian distribution center to recife from sao paulo  which has resulted in reduced tariffs and improved gross margins in the region

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and assumptions  where applicable  on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
allowance for bad debts credit is granted to customers on an unsecured basis 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts at the time revenue is recognized based on the assessment of the business environment  customers financial condition  historical collection experience  accounts receivable aging and customer disputes 
when circumstances arise or a significant event occurs that comes to the attention of management  such as a bankruptcy filing of a customer  the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and adjusted to reflect the change in the estimated amount to be received from the customer 
if the company s aging of receivables balances were to deteriorate  the company would have to record additional provisions for doubtful accounts 
allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out basis  or market 
the company regularly evaluates inventory for obsolescence and records a provision if inventory costs are not estimated to be recoverable in the normal course of business 
if the company s inventories were to become obsolete or slow moving  the company would have to record additional provisions for obsolete inventories 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization  which is computed using straight line and declining balance methods over the estimated useful lives to years of the related assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease 
if the company s estimate of the useful life of its property  plant and equipment changes  the company may have to use a different life to record its depreciation and amortization 
the company reviews property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss  measured by the difference in the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the related asset  is recognized when the future cash flows based on undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
for purposes of estimating future cash flows for possibly impaired assets  the company groups assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill results primarily from the company s purchase of certain of its foreign distributors 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the evaluation requires that the reporting unit underlying the goodwill be measured at fair value and  if this value is less than the carrying value of the unit  a second test must be performed 
under the second test  the current fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the unit including an amount for implied goodwill 
if implied goodwill is less than the net carrying amount of goodwill  then the difference becomes the amount of the impairment that must be recorded in that year 
the annual review did not result in any goodwill impairment for the company 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology licenses 
the technology licenses are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the patented technology 
the technology licenses had a weighted average amortization period of years for purchases in and deferred income taxes deferred income taxes represent the income tax consequences on future years of differences between the income tax basis of assets and liabilities and their basis for financial reporting purposes multiplied by the applicable statutory income tax rate 
valuation allowances are established against deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not
