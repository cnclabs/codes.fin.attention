technology 
since our inception  we have focused our research  development and standardization efforts on developing highly reliable  high performance and cost effective flash memory storage products to address a variety of emerging markets 
we have been actively involved in all aspects of this development  including flash memory process development  chip design  controller development and system level integration to ensure the creation of fully integrated  broadly interoperable products that are compatible with both existing and newly developed system platforms 
we believe our core technical competencies are in high density flash memory process  device  design and reliability  controller design  system level integration  
table of contents compact packaging  and low cost system testing 
we have also initiated  defined and developed standards to meet new market needs and to promote wide acceptance of the standards through interoperability and ease of use 
to achieve compatibility with various electronic platforms regardless of the host processors or operating systems used  we developed new capabilities in flash memory chip design and created intelligent controllers 
we also developed an architecture that can leverage advances in process technology designed for scaleable  high yielding  cost effective and highly reliable manufacturing processes 
we design our products to be compatible with industry standard interfaces used in standard operating systems for personal computers  feature phones and smart phones  pdas and other consumer and industrial products 
our patented intelligent controller with its advanced defect management system permits our flash storage card products to achieve a high level of reliability and longevity 
each one of our flash cards contains many millions of flash memory cells 
for example  our gigabyte cards may contain as many as billion storage cells 
a failure in any one of these cells or in a group or block of cells can result in loss of data such as picture files  and this can occur several years into the life of a flash storage card 
the controller chip inside our cards is designed to detect such defects and recover data under most standard conditions 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
patents and licenses 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
see item factors that may effect future results we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in  we developed the concept of emulation of a hard disk drive with flash solid state memory 
the first related patents were filed by our president and chief executive officer dr 
eli harari and exclusively licensed to us 
as of the end of  we owned or had exclusive rights to approximately united states patents  approximately foreign patents  approximately patent applications pending in the united states  and have foreign counterparts pending on many of the applications in multiple jurisdictions 
we intend to seek additional international and united states patents on our technology 
we currently have patent license agreements with several companies including  among others  intel corporation  or intel  lexar media  inc  or lexar  matsushita  renesas  samsung  sharp electronics kk  or sharp  sony and toshiba 
from time to time  we have also entered into discussions with other companies regarding potential license agreements for our patents 
trade secrets and other confidential information are also important to our business 
we protect our trade secrets through confidentiality and invention assignment agreements 
supply chain 
our supply chain is an important competitive advantage 
silicon sourcing 
all of our flash memory card products require silicon wafers for the memory components and the controller components 
the majority of our memory is supplied from the ventures with toshiba and our toshiba foundry relationship 
this represents captive supply and we are obligated to take the output from the ventures with toshiba 
see ventures with toshiba 
to a lesser extent  we source memory on a foundry basis from renesas and samsung 
we are guaranteed supply of percentages of total output by each of renesas and samsung  but are not obligated to use the guaranteed supply until we give them an order for future purchases 
our controller wafers are currently supplied by tower semiconductor ltd  or tower  and united microelectronics corporation  or umc 
we have a foundry agreement with tower and purchase from umc on a purchase order basis 
see item factors that may affect future results we 
table of contents depend on third party foundries for silicon supply and any shortage or disruption in our supply from these sources will reduce our revenues  earnings and gross margins 
testing and assembly 
we sort and test our wafers at toshiba in yokkaichi  japan  and united test center  inc  in taiwan 
our tested wafers are then shipped to our third party memory assembly subcontractors  including statschippac ltd  or statschippac  in china  and silicon precision industries co  ltd  or spil  in taiwan  and sharp and mitsui co  ltd  both in japan 
our packaged memory final test  card assembly and card test is performed at spil  united test center  ase group and datafab systems  inc in taiwan  and statschippac and flextronics international  ltd  or flextronics  in china 
we believe our use of subcontractors reduces the cost of our operations and gives us access to increased production capacity 
see  item factors that may affect future results we depend on third party subcontractors and our business could be harmed if our subcontractors do not perform as planned 
ventures with toshiba flashvision 
in may  we invested in the flashvision venture  which operated in manassas  virginia until may in april  we and toshiba agreed to consolidate the nand wafer fabrication manufacturing operations in fabs and of toshiba s yokkaichi operations in japan  through a venture named flashvision  ltd  or flashvision 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
toshiba owns the wafer fabrication facilities  yokkaichi fabs and  in which flashvision s tools are installed

capitalization and related matters 
we own of flashvision and toshiba owns of flashvision 
flashvision s funding takes the form of permanent capital billion japanese yen in total and loans funded one half by each owner from toshiba and us 
at the end of  our loans to flashvision were billion japanese yen and we are committed to fund an additional billion japanese yen in flashvision s stated life will terminate in december  but may be terminated by toshiba or by us by notice given from may  to may  there are other termination events described in the master agreement and the operating agreement  which are exhibits to this report 
those agreements should be read carefully in their entirety for a comprehensive understanding of our rights and obligations 
lease facility 
flashvision sold and leased back from mizuho leasing tools  which had an original book value of billion japanese yen 
flashvision has been making lease payments and the remaining fixed lease payment obligation was billion japanese yen at the end of toshiba guaranteed flashvision s performance of its obligations under the lease facility and we agreed to reimburse toshiba for of its claims and associated expenses related to its guarantee agreement  unless those claims resulted from toshiba s failure to meet its obligations to flashvision or breach of toshiba s covenants with the lessors 
we pay toshiba a credit enhancement fee for providing the direct guarantee of flashvision s lease obligations 
in may  flashvision has the option of purchasing the tools from the lessors 
flashvision is obligated to insure the equipment  maintain the equipment in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations and other customary terms to protect the leased assets 
the lease agreement contains customary events of default for a japanese lease facility 
operations 
flashvision s current production ramp plan contemplates a technology transition from nanometers to nanometers in flashvision sells wafers to toshiba and to us at manufacturing cost 
flashvision generates cash over time as a result of being paid as part of manufacturing cost for its non cash depreciation expense 
this cash is currently expected to be used to fund expansion of flashvision s flash memory manufacturing capacity and to repay loans from toshiba and us 
we and toshiba are each committed to take percent of flashvision s wafer output  with each company specifying the type of wafer in its allocation 

table of contents research and development

that agreement should be read carefully in its entirety in order to more fully understand the details of our obligations 
flash partners 
in september  the flash partners  ltd  or flash partners  venture was formed 
the key elements of the venture are semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
toshiba has constructed at its expense a new wafer fabrication facility  fab  at its yokkaichi operations 
flash partners will purchase and pay to install semiconductor manufacturing equipment in fab flash partners has specified a plan for ramping production to  millimeter wafers per month over a period starting in and ending in toshiba and we are currently committed to fund flash partners infrastructure up to a total of  wafers per month in and  which may be increased to meet market demand 
capitalization and related matters 
we own of flash partners and toshiba owns of flash partners 
flash partners funding from its parents will be structured as a combination of permanent capital currently estimated at billion japanese yen in total and loans funded one half by each owner from us and toshiba 
as of january   we estimate our minimum funding commitment to be approximately billion japanese yen  of which we believe billion japanese yen will be satisfied with the portion of flash partners lease facility that we have guaranteed as described below 
flash partners has a stated life of years  but may be terminated by us or toshiba by notice given from april  to march  in addition  we have a termination right that may be exercised by notice between april  and march  there are other termination events described in the master agreement and the operating agreement which are exhibits to this report 
those agreements should be read carefully in their entirety for a comprehensive understanding of our rights and obligations 
sale and leaseback 
flash partners intends to sell and leaseback from a consortium of financial institutions approximately one half of its tools 
in december  flash partners entered into a master lease agreement with these financial institutions providing for up to billion japanese yen of original lease obligations 
there were no amounts outstanding under the master lease agreement at the end of we and toshiba have each guaranteed  on a several basis  of flash partners obligations under the master lease agreement 
flash partners will draw individual tranches under the lease agreements during and each individual draw will have a four year or five year term as agreed by flash partners and the lessors 
lease payments are due quarterly 
at the end of the lease term  flash partners has the option of purchasing the tools from the lessors 
flash partners is obligated to insure the equipment  maintain the equipment in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations and other customary terms to protect the leased assets 
the master lease agreement contains customary events of default for a japanese lease facility and is an exhibit to this report 
that agreement should be read carefully in its entirety for a comprehensive understanding of its terms and the nature of the obligations we guaranteed 
operations 
flash partners current production ramp plan contemplates technology transitions from nanometers  to nanometers and to nanometers 
flash partners currently plans to deliver its first production wafers in the second half of toshiba employees will operate fab  and we have assigned a number of our employees in japan to work in the wafer production facility 
flash partners will reimburse toshiba for its costs of running fab and for the depreciation cost of the fab building and improvements 
flash partners does not receive any commitment from toshiba as to wafer yield or any protection from operational incidents 
we and toshiba are each committed to take percent of flash partners wafer output  with each company specifying the type of wafer 
table of contents in its allocation 
flash partners will sell wafers to us and toshiba at a price equal to manufacturing cost 
flash partners is expected to generate cash over time as a result of being paid as part of its manufacturing cost for its non cash depreciation expense 
this cash is currently expected to be used to fund expansion of flash partners flash memory manufacturing capacity and ultimately to repay loans from us and toshiba 
research and development 
we and toshiba each have teams that are currently working in parallel on the nanometer and nanometer designs 
our research and development cost sharing is similar to that of flashvision 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included as item and the common r d participation agreement which is an exhibit to this report 
that agreement should be read carefully in its entirety in order to more fully understand the details of our obligations 
we refer to our wafer purchases from the toshiba ventures and foundry arrangement with toshiba as captive capacity as compared with our market priced purchases of flash memory from samsung and renesas  which we refer to as non captive capacity 
competition our industry is very competitive 
see item factors that may affect future results we face competition from numerous manufacturers and marketers of products using flash memory  as well as from manufacturers of new and alternative technologies  and if we cannot compete effectively  our results of operations and financial condition will suffer 
our key competitive advantages 
we believe our key competitive advantages in nand flash products include our intellectual property ownership  in particular our patent claims and manufacturing know how over mlc  provides a cost advantage to ourselves and toshiba  through the ventures with toshiba  we benefit from toshiba s manufacturing and research and development experience and expertise  we manufacture and sell a broader range of card formats than any of our competitors which gives us an advantage in obtaining retail and oem distribution  and our captive nand flash wafer supply enables us to control our supply chain and provides cost advantages over our competitors who only have contractual relationships with their suppliers 
semiconductor competitors 
our primary semiconductor competitors currently include our historical competitors renesas  samsung and toshiba 
new competitors include hynix semiconductor  inc  or hynix  infineon technologies  ag  or infineon  micron technology  inc  or micron  and st microelectronics nv  or st micro  who began shipping nand or nand competitive memory in if any of these competitors increase their memory output  it will likely result in a decline in the prevailing prices for packaged nand semiconductor components 
additionally  manufacturers of nor flash memory  such as intel and spansion llc  or spansion  are attempting to use their flash memory for traditional nand applications  both embedded and in data storage cards 
card and usb flash drive competitors 
we compete with manufacturers and resellers of flash memory cards and usb flash drives 
these companies purchase or have captive supply of flash memory components and assemble memory cards 
these companies include  among others  buffalo  dane elec manufacturing  delkin devices  inc  fuji  hagiwara sys com co  ltd  hama  i o data device  inc  infineon  kingston technology company  inc  kodak  lexar  m systems  matsushita  micron  memorex products  inc  pny technologies  inc  pqi corporation  pretec electronics corporation usa  renesas  samsung  sharp  simple technology  inc  sony  toshiba and viking components  inc 
table of contents mp players 
our new digital audio players face competition from products offered by other companies  including apple computer  inc  or apple  creative technologies  ltd  or creative  iriver america  inc  or iriver  rio digital networks north america  inc  or rio  and samsung 
other 
there are other technologies that compete with our product offerings 
there are many companies that are attempting to develop memory cells that use different designs and materials than the semiconductors in the marketplace today 
when these technologies can be manufactured in high volume  they could have a significant cost advantage over nand memory technologies 
we also face competition from hard disk drives 
small hard disk drives have a lower cost per megabyte today than does nand flash  however the minimum density is higher making the hard disk drive expensive in applications that may not require as much memory as the hard disk provides 
the hard disk drives in the market today also have significant power requirements and are not as rugged as flash memory 
the competitive disadvantages of these other technologies may be reduced or eliminated over time 
employees as of january   we had full time employees  including in research and development  in sales and marketing  in general and administration and in operations 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced any work stoppage

our flash data storage cards are marketed and sold primarily in the consumer electronics market 
we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash cards  consumers will demand an increasing number of megabytes of memory 
in order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity in the market for flash data storage cards  we must reduce our cost per megabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per megabyte to the consumer 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors including  among others  the unit volume of product sales  the flash memory density of the products sold  competitive pricing pressures  availability of foundry capacity from both captive and non captive sources  the timing and volume of sell through by our distributors and retail customers to their customers  variations in manufacturing cycle times  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and manufacturing capacity utilization  the timing of significant orders  our ability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient supply  changes in product and customer mix  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in the channels through which our products are distributed  timing of new product announcements and introductions by us and our competitors  the timing of license and royalty revenues  fluctuations in product costs  increased research and development expenses  and exchange rate fluctuations 
see factors that may affect future results 
we operate in one business segment  flash memory products 
our chief decision maker  our president and chief executive officer  evaluates our performance based on company wide  consolidated results 
revenue is evaluated based on geographic region and by product category 
separate financial information is not available by product category with respect to asset allocation  expense allocation or profitability 
memory sourcing 
nand memory is the largest component of the cost of our products 
we preferentially source nand memory from ventures with toshiba and our toshiba foundry arrangement 
we also purchase flash memory products from non captive sources  to supplement our captive supply  allowing us to flexibly capture more market share 
this non captive supply enabled us to generate additional sales and profits even though the gross margin on our non captive supply is significantly lower 
table of contents than the gross margin on our captive supply 
however  our captive supply requires us to invest in capital assets  research and development and start up and other production costs 
we expect to continue sourcing non captive flash memory 
licensing and royalties 
the timing and amount of royalty revenues and the recognition of license fees can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the terms of our license agreements and the timing and volume of sales of products by our licensees 
gross margins and operating income fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in product revenues since license and royalty revenues have no variable costs of sale 
retail sales 
our arrangements with retailers often involve complex terms 
these terms include providing the retailer with a right to return unsold product  market development funds  cooperative advertising funds  price protection  promotions  and volume incentive rebates 
in some cases  we consign inventory to our customers 
these consignment activities reduce our working capital and involve administrative costs to track and account for our inventory 
we defer recognition of revenue on sales to retailers and distributors until they sell the product they have purchased from us to their customers 
we also have agreements with some of our customers in which we agree to protect their inventory balances against changes in our suggested retail price 
our retail business is seasonal  with the fourth quarter being the strongest due to holiday sales in north america 
memory market dynamics 
semiconductor memory markets have generally been characterized by cycles of undersupply leading to the building of additional capacity  which in turn has led to oversupply which reduces prevailing prices per megabyte in the market 
in an oversupply environment  the value of our inventory decreases resulting in charges against earnings 
in for example  we recorded approximately million of charges related to inventory revaluation 
we may be forced to reduce the carrying value of our inventory if market demand for our products deteriorates and our inventory levels exceed customer orders 
in addition  we may record additional lower of cost or market price adjustments to our inventories if pricing pressure results in a net realizable value that is lower than our cost 
our business is characterized by constant focus on cost reduction 
nand flash memory cost reduction is achieved by transitioning to new generations of technology  larger wafer sizes or improving yields 
manufacturing yields are lower at the start of manufacturing each successive product generation 
during the start up phase  the fabrication equipment and operating expenses are applied to a relatively small output of production wafers  making this output very expensive 
in the next two to three years  we expect to make substantial new investments in additional fabrication capacity in the ventures with toshiba 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  among others  those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates have historically approximated actual results 
however  future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances and sales incentive programs 
we recognize net revenues when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  transfer of title and acceptance  if applicable  fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization 
sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and  therefore  the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer  or the rights of return expire 
at january  
table of contents and december   deferred income  from sales to distributors and retailers was million and million  respectively 
estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenue and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statements 
revenue from patent licensing arrangements is recognized when earned and estimable 
the timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the terms of each license agreement and on the timing of product shipments of licensed products 
we generally recognize royalty revenue when it is reported to us by our licensees  which is generally one quarter in arrears from our licensees sales 
we recognize license fee revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the license 
we have cross license arrangements that include a guarantee of access to flash memory supply 
we recognize license fees received on a straight line basis over the life of the license  which corresponds to the term of the supply guarantees 
we recognize no income associated with the license we receive back from the licensee because we have no vendor specific evidence as to the fair value of those rights 
when we purchase product under our guaranteed capacity from our licensee  we recognize the gross profits from the sale of such goods in the ordinary manner and do not increase our license and royalty revenue because we have no vendor specific evidence of the fair value of the supply guarantee 
at january  and december   deferred revenue from patent license agreements was million and million  respectively 
the cost of revenues associated with patent license and royalty revenues was insignificant for each of the three years in the period ended january  we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings  including price protection  promotions  co op advertising  and other volume based incentives and expected returns 
additionally  we have incentive programs that require us to estimate  based on historical experience  the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
marketing development programs are either recorded as a reduction to revenue or as an addition to marketing expense in compliance with the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force  or eitf  of the financial standards accounting board  or fasb  on issue inventories and inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost approximating first in  first out or market 
market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal 
should actual market conditions differ from our estimates  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
our inventory impairment charges permanently establish a new cost basis and are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable 
rather these amounts reverse into income only if  as and when the inventory is sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings or substantial down grading of credit ratings  we provide a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we provide allowances for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due based on our historical experience 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the collectibility of an account could be reduced by a material amount 
warranty costs 
the majority of our products are warrantied for one to five years 
a provision for the estimated future cost to repair or replace non conforming products is recorded at the time of customer invoice 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and repair or replacement costs incurred in supporting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  or repair or replacement costs differ from our estimates  increases or decreases to our warranty liability would be required 
accounting for investments 
if we hold equity interests representing less than of the outstanding voting interests of an entity we invested in  we use the cost method of accounting 
if we hold at least but less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of an entity we invested in  we use the equity 
table of contents method of accounting 
with respect to all equity investments  we review the degree of control that our investment and other arrangements give us over the entity we have invested in and our business to confirm that these conclusions are correct 
additionally  we evaluate whether entities that we have invested in are variable interest entities within the meaning of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for variable interest entities 
if those entities are variable interest entities  then we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of that entity by reference to our contractual and business arrangements with respect to residual gains and residual losses on liquidation of that entity 
share based compensation 
as discussed below  we historically accounted for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method  and accordingly no expense has been recognized in our consolidated income statements for options granted to employees or directors under our stock option plans 
we have also accounted for our employee purchase plan using the intrinsic value method and accordingly  we have not recognized any expense for the discount provided on the fair market value of the stock sold under our employee stock purchase plan 
valuation of financial instruments 
our short term investments include investments in marketable equity and debt securities 
our investments in these securities are carried at market value  with any increases or decreases above cost  or amortized cost in the case of debt securities  being recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
we evaluate market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples and other key measures to determine whether declines in market value below cost  or amortized cost in the case of debt securities  is other than temporary 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
we have the financial capability and the intent to hold our loans to the ventures with toshiba until maturity and accordingly those loans are carried at cost and their value in our financial statements is not adjusted to market value 
deferred tax assets 
we provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be realized 
at january   we carried a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of approximately million based primarily on our more likely than not basis  the inability to take tax benefit for unrealized capital losses on our investments in foundries 
at december   based on the weight of all available evidence  we carried no valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
at january   our valuation allowance associated with unrealized losses on our tower investment was reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
foreign currency 
we determine the functional currency for our parent company and each of our subsidiaries by reviewing the currencies in which their respective operating activities occur 
transaction gains and losses arising from selling products and other activities other than the applicable functional currency are calculated using average exchange rates for the applicable period and reported as a non operating item in each period 
balance sheet items denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional currency are translated using the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date and are included as a separate component of other comprehensive income 
as permitted under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation  we do not mark to market our contingent foreign currency exposure on our take or pay and lease guarantee obligations related to the ventures with toshiba 
although we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure  we evaluate our foreign currency exposures and may enter into hedges or other risk mitigating arrangements in the future 
results of operations comparison of and product revenues 
our product revenues were billion  an increase of over million in the increase in our product revenues was comprised of a increase in the number of megabytes sold and a reduction in our average selling price per megabyte 
the markets 
table of contents that we sell to have been price elastic 
as the price per megabyte came down  the average memory density of our products sold increased significantly and our unit sales also increased by 
the growth in our unit sales is also attributable to growth in the markets for digital still cameras  usb flash drives  feature phones and  most recently  flash based digital audio players 
in addition  our fiscal consisted of weeks as compared to weeks in the prior year 
we expect our average selling price per megabyte to continue to decline  with growth in our megabytes sold to more than offset the price decline  resulting in continued revenue growth 
license and royalty revenues 
our license and royalty revenues were million  an increase of from million in the increase in license and royalty income was primarily due to increased royalty bearing sales by our licensees 
gross margins 
our product gross margin in was down from in the largest driver of the decline in product gross margins was an increased reliance on non captive memory sources 
we earn significantly lower gross margins on non captive memory than on captive memory supply  and non captive memory accounted for approximately and of our memory sourcing in and  respectively 
our captive gross margin improved by approximately two percentage points as our cost reductions were greater than the decline in average selling price per megabyte 
this partially offset the impact of our higher non captive mix 
we expect our gross margins will include incremental costs associated with flashvision s nanometer transition and the start up of flash partners millimeter production line 
research and development 
our research and development expenses for and were million or of revenues and million or of revenues  respectively 
our research and development expense growth of was primarily due to increased payroll and payroll related expenses associated with higher headcount in support of our broadening product portfolio  higher vendor engineering costs and costs associated with the initial design and development of manufacturing process technology related to flash partners millimeter production line 
we grew our research and development headcount to at the end of from at the end of we expect that research and development expenses may increase as a percentage of revenues as flash partners start up costs will continue to be reflected as research and development expenses until the millimeter nand production line achieves technological feasibility 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses were million or of revenues compared with million or of revenues in our sales and marketing expense growth of was primarily related to increased tradeshow  advertising and branding  and payroll and payroll related expenses  all in support of our higher revenue base

general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses were million or of revenues compared with million or of revenues in our general and administrative expense growth of primarily relates to increased legal expenses related in part to higher litigation expenses to defend our intellectual property  increased staffing and consulting expenses to support our expanded business and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  as well as provisions for doubtful accounts due to the growth in accounts receivable balances 
we expect that our expenditures on intellectual property litigation will increase in over non operating income loss  net 
net non operating income items were million

our non operating items for netted to million 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately compared to an effective tax rate in of 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state tax expense  net of federal benefit 
our future tax rate may be impacted by state taxes  our ability to realize tax benefits from capital losses and the geographic mix of our earnings 
other comprehensive income 
foreign currency translation adjustments in were million 
unrealized loss on investments was million 
we expect that over time our international operations will expand resulting in increased foreign currency exposure 
changes in prevailing interest rates in the united states would affect the fair market value of our short term investment portfolio  which generated the majority of our unrealized gains at the end of other comprehensive income adjustments totaled million in cash flows 
operating activities generated million of cash during the year ended january  significant contributors to the generation of cash from operations were net income of million  non cash adjustments to income for depreciation and amortization of million  allowances for doubtful accounts of million  amortization accretion related to original premium discount on short term investments of million and amortization of bond issuance costs of million  decreases in deposits and other assets of million  increases in accrued payroll and related expenses of million and both current and non current other accrued liabilities of million 
these were partially offset by increases in the inventory balance of million  accounts receivable of million and decreases in deferred income on shipments to distributors and retailers and deferred revenue of million  and decreases in accounts payable  income taxes payable and other current liabilities to related parties of million 
operating activities generated million during the year ended december  we used million for investing activities

we used million for investing activities during the year ended december  we generated million of cash from exercises of stock options and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
we generated million from financing activities during the year ended december  as discussed under liquidity and capital resources  we expect to grow our investments in flash partners and flashvision in comparison of and product revenues 
in  our product revenues were million  an increase of over in the increase in our product revenues was primarily the result of higher unit volumes and higher average card capacities within the digital still camera market 
in addition  we entered the market for usb flash drives which contributed to our revenue growth 
our megabytes sold increased in compared to  while our average selling price per megabyte decreased approximately 
license and royalty revenues 
in  our license and royalty revenues were million  an increase of from million in the increase in license and royalty revenues between and was primarily the result of increased royalty bearing sales by our licensees 
gross margins 
our product gross margin in was  up from in the increase in product gross margin was the result of a fairly stable pricing environment particularly in the second half of resulting from constrained industry supply  combined with lower manufacturing costs resulting from the nanometer to nanometer conversion and economies of scale related to higher unit volumes 
these positive contributors to gross margin were partially offset by flashvision start up and tool relocation costs 
in addition  during fiscal  we sold approximately million of inventory that had been fully written off in prior periods  which favorably impacted gross margin by approximately percentage points for fiscal research and development 
our research and development expenses were million or of revenues compared with million or of revenues in research and development

the terms of the flashvision venture contractually obligate us to purchase half of flashvision s nand wafer production output 
this obligation is denominated in japanese yen and is non cancellable 
we cannot estimate the total amount of this commitment as of january  because our price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the semiconductor wafers 
as part of the flashvision and flash partners agreements  we agreed to share in toshiba s costs associated with nand product development and its common semiconductor research and development activities 
as of january   we had accrued liabilities related to those expenses of million

future exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our foreign currency transaction and translation adjustments were not material over the past three years 
although most of our transactions in the people s republic of china are denominated in united states dollars  we have noted the significant growth in the local economy over the past several years 
the chinese yuan to united states dollar exchange rate is currently fixed by the chinese government  but instability in the chinese economy or exchange rates could lead to our subcontractors in the people s republic of china demanding altered terms in their arrangements with us 
for a discussion of foreign operating risks and foreign currency risks  see factors that may affect future results 
impact of recently issued accounting standards the fasb adopted a revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas r  share based payments  with an effective date of june  we expect to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of  a transition provision allowed under sfas r  and we currently do not expect to restate prior periods to conform with the new accounting standard 
sfas r will require us to recognize an expense based on the fair value of all share based payments to employees  including grants of options to buy shares of our common stock 
we are unable to estimate the effect of adopting sfas r because the actual amount will be determined by reference to inputs to our option pricing model at the time of future share based compensation awards 
adoption of sfas r is expected to increase our operating expenses 
the fasb adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs  an amendment to arb no 
 with an effective date of june  sfas requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and spoilage be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal 
table of contents capacity of the applicable production facility 
as permitted by sfas  we will adopt sfas at the beginning of and do not expect that its adoption will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
the eitf of the fasb delayed the effectiveness of a portion of the eitf consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment 
the delayed portions of the consensus on eitf would require recognition of an other than temporary impairment of a debt instrument based on interest rate changes  sector credit ratings and company specific changes that do not result in the conclusion that non collection of principal or interest is probable 
had eitf been effective for  we do not believe it would have had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results our operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect our operations and our stock price 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
this fluctuation could result from a variety of factors  including  among others  the following the factors listed elsewhere under factors that may affect future results  unpredictable or changing demand for our products  decline in the average selling prices  net of promotions  for our products due to excess supply  competitive pricing pressures and strategic price reductions initiated by us or our competitors  our license and royalty revenues may decline in the future as our existing license agreements expire or our licensees reach their royalty payment caps  timing of sell through by our distributors and retail customers  continued development of new markets and products for nand flash memory  timing and volume of wafer production from our flash partners venture and costs associated with the flash partners facility  increased purchases of flash memory products from our non captive sources that may affect our gross margins  difficulty in forecasting and managing inventory levels  particularly  building a large inventory of unsold product due to non cancelable contractual obligations to purchase materials such as flash memory  controllers  printed circuit boards and discrete components  write downs of our investments in fabrication capacity  other fixed assets  equity investments and prepaid wafer credits  expensing of share based compensation  adverse changes in product and customer mix  terrorist attacks  governmental responses to those attacks and natural disasters  and changes in general economic conditions 
sales to a small number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues and if we were to lose one of our major licensees or customers or experience any material reduction in orders from any of our customers  our revenues and operating results would suffer 
sales to our top customers and licensees accounted for more than  and of our total revenues during  and  respectively 
if we were to lose one of our major licensees or customers or experience any material reduction in orders from any of our customers or in sales of licensed products by our licensees  our revenues and operating results would suffer 
our sales are generally made by standard purchase orders 
table of contents rather than long term contracts 
accordingly  our customers may generally terminate or reduce their purchases from us at any time without notice or penalty 
in addition  the composition of our major customer base changes from year to year as the market demand for our customers products changes 
additionally  our license and royalty revenues may decline in the future as our existing license agreements expire  caps are reached or rates change 
our business depends significantly upon sales of products in the highly competitive consumer market  a significant portion of which are made to retailers and through distributors  and if our distributors and retailers are not successful in this market  we could experience substantial product returns  which would negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our sales are made through retailers  either directly or through distributors 
sales through these channels typically include rights to return unsold inventory and protection against price declines 
as a result  we do not recognize revenue until after the product has been sold through to the end user  in the case of sales to retailers  or to distributor customers  in the case of sales to distributors 
if our distributors and retailers are not successful in this market  there could be substantial product returns or price protection claims  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
availability of sell through data varies throughout the retail channel  which makes it difficult for us to determine actual retail product revenues until after the end of each of our fiscal quarters 
our arrangements with our customers also provide them price protections against declines in our recommended selling prices  which has the effect of reducing our deferred revenue 
except in limited circumstances  we do not have exclusive relationships with our retailers or distributors and therefore must rely on them to effectively sell our products over those of our competitors 
our average selling prices  net of promotions  may decline due to excess supply  competitive pricing pressures and strategic price reductions initiated by us or our competitors 
the market for nand flash products is competitive and characterized by rapid price declines 
price declines may be influenced by  among other factors  supply in excess of demand from existing or new competitors  technology transitions  new technologies or strategic actions by competitors to gain market share 
if our cost reductions fail to keep pace with the rate of price declines  our gross margin and operating results will be negatively impacted 
our revenue depends  in part  on the success of products sold by our oem customers 
a portion of our sales are to a number of oems who bundle our flash memory products with their products  such as cameras or handsets 
our sales to these customers are dependent upon a particular oem s ability to create  introduce  market and sell their products successfully in their respective markets 
should our oem customers be unsuccessful in selling their products  which include our product  or should they decide to discontinue bundling our products  our results of operation and financial condition could be harmed 
the continued growth of our business depends on the development of new markets and products for nand flash memory 
over the last several years  we have derived the vast majority of our revenue from the digital camera market 
as this market begins to experience slower growth rates  our growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new markets and new products for nand flash memory 
specifically  one of the new markets that we are focused on is the handset market in which feature phones are increasingly being designed to utilize nand flash memory cards 
there can be no assurance that new markets and products will develop and grow fast enough  or that new markets will adopt nand flash technologies or our products  to enable us to continue our growth 
we continually seek to develop new products and standards  which may not be widely adopted by consumers or  if adopted  may reduce demand by consumers for our older products 
we continually seek to develop new products and standards and enhance existing products and standards with higher memory capacities and other enhanced features 
we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be successful in penetrating the new markets that we target  such as the digital audio player market or the consumable flash market with our shoot and store products 
as we introduce new standards and new products  it will take time for these new standards and products to be adopted  for consumers to accept and transition to these new products and for significant sales to be generated from 
table of contents them  if this happens at all 
moreover  broad acceptance of new standards or products by consumers may reduce demand for our older products 
if this decreased demand is not offset by increased demand for our new products  our results of operations could be harmed 
we cannot assure you that any new products or standards we develop will be commercially successful 
we face competition from numerous manufacturers and marketers of products using flash memory  as well as from manufacturers of new and alternative technologies  and if we cannot compete effectively  our results of operations and financial condition will suffer 
our competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have greater access to advanced wafer manufacturing capacity and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  which allows them to produce flash memory chips in high volumes at low costs and to sell these flash memory chips to our flash card competitors at a low cost 
some of our competitors may sell their flash memory chips at below their true manufacturing costs to gain market share and to cover their fixed costs 
such practices have been common in the dram industry during periods of excess supply  and have resulted in substantial losses in the dram industry 
in addition  many semiconductor companies have announced plans to bring up substantial new capacity of flash memory 
if the combined total new flash memory capacity exceeds the corresponding growth in demand  prices may decline dramatically  adversely impacting our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  current and future competitors produce or could produce alternative flash memory technologies that compete against our nand mlc flash memory technology 
our primary semiconductor competitors currently include our historical competitors renesas  samsung and toshiba 
new competitors include hynix  infineon  micron and st micro  who began shipping nand or nand competitive memory in if any of these competitors increase their memory output  it will likely result in a decline in the prevailing prices for packaged nand semiconductor components 
additionally  manufacturers of nor flash memory  such as intel and spansion  are attempting to use their flash memory for traditional nand applications  both embedded and in data storage cards 
we compete with flash memory card manufacturers and resellers 
these companies purchase or have captive supply of flash memory components and assemble memory cards 
these companies include  among others  dane elec manufacturing  delkin devices  fuji  hagiwara  hama  i o data  infineon  jessops  kingston  lexar  m systems  matsushita battery  micron  memorex  panasonic  pny  pqi  pretec  renesas  samsung  sharp  sony  toshiba and viking components 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do  have well recognized brand names or have the ability to operate their business on lower margins than we do 
the success of our competitors may adversely affect our future sales revenues and may result in the loss of our key customers 
lexar introduced a line of flash cards bearing the kodak brand name  which creates significant competition for our flash memory cards 
in addition  other companies  such as matrix semiconductor  have announced products or technologies that may compete with our shoot and store products 
our transflash product faces competition from m systems and samsung who have announced similar form factors and from advanced micro devices  inc  intel  samsung and sharp who have competing embedded solutions 
our new music players face competition from similar products offered by other companies  including apple  creative  iriver  rio and samsung 
if our products cannot compete effectively  our market share and profitability will be adversely impacted 
futhermore  many companies are pursuing new or alternative technologies  such as nanotechnologies or microdrives  which may compete with flash memory 
these new or alternative technologies may provide smaller size  higher capacity  reduced costs  lower power consumption or other advantages 
if we cannot compete effectively  our results of operations and financial condition will suffer 
we have patent cross license agreements with several of our leading competitors 
under these agreements  we have enabled competitors to manufacture and sell products that incorporate technology covered by our patents 
if we continue to license our patents to our competitors  competition may increase and may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including price  quality  and on time delivery to our customers  product performance  availability and differentiation  success in developing new applications and new market segments  adequate manufacturing capacity  efficiency of production  timing of new product announcements or introductions by us  our customers and our competitors  the ability of our competitors to incorporate standards or develop formats which we do not offer  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  successful protection of intellectual property rights  and general market and economic conditions 
we can not assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in the marketplace 
the semiconductor industry is subject to significant downturns and our take or pay commitments to the ventures with toshiba may result in losses 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price decline  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies and their customers products and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated declines in selling prices 
we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience such downturns in the future 
our obligation to purchase of the output from the ventures with toshiba would harm our business and results of operations if there was a downturn in the memory markets 
the adverse effects include  among other things  significant decreases in our pricing of products  significant excess  obsolete or lower of cost or market inventory write downs and the impairment of our investments in the ventures with toshiba 
any future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on third party foundries for silicon supply and any shortage or disruption in our supply from these sources will reduce our revenues  earnings and gross margins 
all of our flash memory card products require silicon supply for the memory and controller components 
the substantial majority of our flash memory is currently supplied by the ventures with toshiba and by toshiba pursuant to our foundry agreement  and to a lesser extent by renesas and samsung 
currently  our controller wafers are only manufactured by tower and umc 
in times of significant growth in global demand for flash memory  demand from our customers may outstrip the supply of flash memory and controllers available to us from our current sources 
if our silicon vendors are unable to satisfy our requirements on competitive terms or at all due to natural disaster  power failure  labor unrest  their refusal to do business with us  their relationships with our competitors or other causes  we may lose potential sales and our business  financial condition and operating results may suffer 
in addition  these risks are magnified at toshiba s yokkaichi operations where the ventures are operated and toshiba s foundry capacity is located 
for example  in  more than one earthquake  as well as an unrelated power outage  resulted in production line stoppage and loss of wafers in yokkaichi 
also  the tower fabrication facility  from which we source controller wafers  is located in israel  an area of political turmoil 
any disruption in supply from our silicon sources could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our actual manufacturing yields may be lower than our expectations resulting in increased costs and product shortages 
the fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled 
table of contents and ultra clean environment 
semiconductor manufacturing yields and product reliability are a function of both design technology and manufacturing process technology and production delays may be caused by equipment malfunctions  fabrication facility accidents or human errors 
yield problems may not be identified or improved until an actual product is made and can be tested 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process 
we have from time to time experienced adverse yields which have adversely affected our business and results of operations 
we have experienced adverse yields on more than one occasion when we have transitioned to new generations of products 
if actual yields are low  we will experience higher costs and reduced product availability  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in  we expect to begin transitioning from nanometer technology to nanometer technology at flashvision 
if yields from the nanometer wafers do not improve as expected  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be harmed 
in transitioning to new processes and products  we face production and market acceptance risks that have caused  and may in the future cause  significant product delays that could harm our business 
successive generations of our products have incorporated semiconductors with greater memory capacity per chip 
the transition to new generations of products is highly complex and requires new controllers  new test procedures and modifications of numerous aspects of manufacturing  as well as extensive qualification of the new products by both us and our oem customers 
any material delay in a qualification schedule could delay deliveries and adversely impact our operating results 
we periodically have experienced significant delays in the development and volume production ramp up of our products 
similar delays could occur in the future and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we and toshiba plan to continue to expand the wafer fabrication capacity of our flashvision and flash partners business ventures in japan and as we do so  we will make substantial capital investments and incur substantial start up and tool relocation costs  which could adversely impact our operating results 
we and toshiba plan to make substantial investments in new capital assets to expand the wafer fabrication capacity of our flashvision and flash partners business ventures in japan 
each time that we and toshiba add substantial new wafer fabrication capacity  we will experience significant initial design and development and start up costs as a result of the delay between the time of the investment and the time qualified products are manufactured and sold in volume quantities 
for several quarters  we will incur initial design and development costs and start up costs and pay our share of ongoing operating activities even if we do not achieve the planned output volume or utilize our full share of the expanded output  and these costs will impact our gross margins  results of operations and financial condition neither we nor toshiba have operated millimeter flash memory wafer manufacturing lines and there is no assurance that flash partners facility will perform as expected 
we believe that our future success will continue to depend on the development and introduction of new generations of flash memory wafers  such as the millimeter wafers to be produced by flash partners 
these wafers are substantially larger in surface area and therefore more susceptible to new technological and manufacturing issues  such as mechanical and thermal stresses  than the current  mature millimeter wafers that we use in production at yokkaichi fabs and toshiba does not have prior experience in manufacturing millimeter advanced nand designs  nor in operating a new equipment set that has to be optimized to process millimeter nand wafers with competitive yields 
moreover  we have no experience in operating a wafer manufacturing line and we rely on toshiba s capability to operate and manage the yokkaichi facilities 
this reliance will increase when the fab facility commences operations 
during the early stages of operating the new millimeter wafer processing equipment  we expect the venture to generate a large number of test wafers and perform numerous process test splits that will increase our research and development expenses through most of  prior to benefiting from any actual production output from fab we cannot assure you that flash partners facility will perform as expected or be ready for volume production on time 
nor can we assure you that the cost to equip the facility will not be significantly more than planned 
samsung  the world s largest nand flash memory manufacturer  already has experience manufacturing millimeter wafers with nanometer feature sizes 
also  samsung is licensed under our patents to use mlc technology  which further enhances its manufacturing capabilities 

table of contents samsung may be able to produce product at a lower cost than we can and increase their market share  thus adversely affecting our operating results and financial condition 
we have a contingent indemnification obligation for certain liabilities toshiba incurs as a result of toshiba s guarantee of the flashvision equipment lease arrangement and have environmental and intellectual property indemnification as well as guarantee obligations with respect to flash partners 
toshiba has guaranteed flashvision s lease arrangement with third party lessors 
the total minimum remaining lease payments as of the end of were billion japanese yen 
if toshiba makes payments under its guarantee  we have agreed to indemnify toshiba for of its costs 
we have guaranteed up to billion japanese yen of flash partners obligations to third party lessors 
flash partners had not drawn any amounts under the lease facility as of the end of  but intends to draw the entire facility in we and toshiba have also agreed to mutually contribute to  and indemnify each other and flash partners for  environmental remediation costs or liability resulting from flash partners manufacturing operations in certain circumstances 
in addition  we and toshiba entered into a patent indemnification agreement under which in many cases we will share in the expenses associated with the defense and cost of settlement associated with such claims 
this agreement provides limited protection for us against third party claims that nand flash memory products manufactured and sold by flash partners infringe third party patents 
none of the foregoing obligations are reflected as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
if we have to perform our obligations under these agreements  our business will be harmed and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
seasonality in our business may result in our inability to accurately forecast our product purchase requirements 
sales of our products in the consumer electronics market are subject to seasonality 
for example  sales have typically increased significantly in the fourth quarter of each year  sometimes followed by declines in the first quarter of the following year 
this seasonality increases the complexity of forecasting our business 
if our forecasts are inaccurate  we can lose market share or procure excess inventory or inappropriately increase or decrease our operating expenses  any of which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this seasonality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price  the need for significant working capital investments in receivables and inventory and our need to build up inventory levels in advance of our most active selling seasons 
from time to time  we overestimate our requirements and build excess inventories  and underestimate our requirements and have a shortage of supply  both of which harm our financial results 
the majority of our products are sold into consumer markets  which are difficult to accurately forecast 
a substantial majority of our quarterly sales are from orders received and fulfilled in that quarter 
additionally  we depend upon timely reporting from our retail and distributor customers as to their inventory levels and sales of our products in order to forecast demand for our products 
our international customers submit these reports on a monthly  not weekly  basis making it more difficult to accurately forecast demand 
we have in the past significantly over forecasted and under forecasted actual demand for our products 
the failure to accurately forecast demand for our products will result in lost sales or excess inventory both of which will have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during periods of excess supply in the market for our flash memory products  we may lose market share to competitors who aggressively lower their prices 
conversely  under conditions of tight flash memory supply  we may be unable to adequately increase our production volumes or secure sufficient supply in order to maintain our market share 
if we are unable to maintain market share  our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
our ability to respond to changes in market conditions from our forecast is limited by our purchasing arrangements with our silicon sources 
these arrangements generally provide that the first three months of our rolling six month projected supply requirements are fixed and we may make only limited percentage changes in the second three months of the period covered by our supply requirement projections 

table of contents we are sole sourced for a number of our critical components and the absence of a back up supplier exposes our supply chain to unanticipated disruptions 
we rely on our vendors  some of which are a sole source of supply  for many of our critical components 
we do not have long term supply agreements with most of these vendors 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be significantly harmed by delays or reductions in shipments if we are unable to develop alternative sources or obtain sufficient quantities of these components 
we depend on our third party subcontractors and our business could be harmed if our subcontractors do not perform as planned 
we rely on third party subcontractors for our wafer testing  packaged memory final testing  product assembly  product testing and order fulfillment 
we do not have long term contracts with our existing subcontractors nor do we expect to have long term contracts with any new subcontract suppliers 
we do not have exclusive relationships with any of subcontractors and therefore cannot guarantee that they will devote sufficient resources to manufacturing our products 
we cannot  and will not  be able to directly control product delivery schedules 
furthermore  we manufacture on a turnkey basis with some of our subcontract suppliers 
in these arrangements we do not have visibility and control of their inventories of purchased parts necessary to build our products or of the progress of our products through their assembly line 
any significant problems that occur at our subcontractors  or their failure to perform at the level we expect  could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems  either of which would have adverse effects on our operating results 
we are exposed to foreign currency risks 
many of our purchases of nand flash memory from our toshiba venture and our investments in those ventures are denominated in japanese yen 
additionally  we expect over time to increase the percentage of our sales denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
management of these foreign exchange exposures and the hedging mechanisms used to mitigate those exposures is complicated and we have limited experience in these activities 
if we do not successfully manage our foreign exchange exposures  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
terrorist attacks  war  threats of war and government responses thereto may negatively impact our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
terrorist attacks  us military responses to these attacks  war  threats of war and any corresponding decline in consumer confidence could have a negative impact on consumer retail demand  which is the largest channel for our products 
any of these events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers 
any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets  which could harm our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers or adversely affect consumer confidence 
this could harm our business and results of operations 
natural disasters or epidemics in the countries in which we or our suppliers or subcontractors operate could negatively impact our operations 
our operations  including those of our suppliers and subcontractors  are concentrated in sunnyvale  california  yokkaichi  japan  taichung  taiwan and dongguan  shenzen and shanghai china 
in the past  these areas have been affected by natural disasters such as earthquakes  tsunamis and typhoons  and some areas have been affected by epidemics  such as sars 
if a natural disaster or epidemic were to occur in one or more or these areas  our disaster recovery processes may not provide adequate business continuity 
this could harm our business and results of operations 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
in the past  we have been involved in significant disputes regarding our intellectual property rights and those of others  including claims that we may be infringing third parties patents  
table of contents trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
we expect that we may be involved in similar disputes in the future 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing patents will not be invalidated  patents will be issued for any of our pending applications  any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength  our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage  or any of our products do not infringe on the patents of other companies 
in addition  our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents 
several companies have recently entered or announced their intentions to enter the flash memory market  and we believe these companies may require a license from us 
enforcement of our rights may require litigation 
if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful  our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us 
moreover  the defendant in such an action may successfully counter sue us for infringement of their patent or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable 
if we did not prevail as a defendant in a patent infringement case  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of specific processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
we may be unable to license intellectual property to or from third parties as needed  or renew existing licenses  and we have agreed to indemnify various suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement  which could expose us to liability for damages  increase our costs or limit or prohibit us from selling products 
if we incorporate third party technology into our products or if we are found to infringe others intellectual property  we could be required to license intellectual property from a third party 
we may also need to license some of our intellectual property to others in order to enable us to obtain important cross licenses to third party patents 
we cannot be certain that licenses will be offered when we need them  or that the terms offered will be acceptable  or that these licenses will help our business 
if we do obtain licenses from third parties  we may be required to pay license fees or royalty payments 
in addition  if we are unable to obtain a license that is necessary to the manufacture of our products  we could be required to suspend the manufacture of products or stop our product suppliers from using processes that may infringe the rights of third parties 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in redesigning our products or that the necessary licenses will be available under reasonable terms  or that our existing licensees will renew their licenses upon expiration  or that we will be successful in signing new licensees in the future 
we have historically agreed to indemnify suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement 
the scope of such indemnity varies  but may  in some instances  include indemnification for damages and expenses  including attorneys fees 
we may periodically engage in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations 
our insurance policies exclude coverage for third party claims for patent infringement 
any future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are currently and may in the future be involved in litigation  including litigation regarding our intellectual property rights or those of third parties  which would be costly and would divert the efforts of our key personnel 
we are involved in a number of lawsuits  including among others  several cases involving our patents and the patents of third parties 
we are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in other of these actions 
some of the actions seek injunctions against the sale of our products and or substantial monetary damages  which if granted or awarded  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents litigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
factors that could cause litigation results to differ include  but are not limited to  the discovery of previously unknown facts  changes in the law or in the interpretation of laws  and uncertainties associated with the judicial decision making process 
if we receive an adverse judgment in any litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages and or cease the manufacture  use and sale of products 
litigation  including intellectual property litigation  can be complex  can extend for a protracted period of time  and can be expensive 
litigation initiated by us could also result in counter claims against us  which could increase the costs associated with the litigation and result in our payment of damages or other judgments against us 
in addition  litigation may divert the efforts and attention of some of our key personnel 
we have been subject to  and expect to continue to be subject to  claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
from time to time we have sued  and may in the future sue  third parties in order to protect our intellectual property rights 
parties that we have sued and that we may sue for patent infringement may counter sue us for infringing their patents 
if we are held to infringe the intellectual property of others  we may need to spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses from third parties  but we may not be able to develop such technology or acquire such licenses on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may also be required to pay significant damages and or discontinue the use of certain manufacturing or design processes 
if we are required to pay significant monetary damages  are enjoined from selling any of our products  develop new technology or are required to make substantial royalty payments  our business would be harmed 
moreover  from time to time we agree to indemnify certain of our suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement 
the scope of such indemnity varies but may in some instances include indemnification for damages and expenses  including attorneys fees 
we may from time to time be engaged in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations 
third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from coverage under our insurance policies 
a future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information concerning legal proceedings  see item legal proceedings 
because of our international business and operations  we must comply with numerous international laws and regulations  and we are vulnerable to political instability  currency fluctuations and other risks related to international operations 
currently  all of our products are produced overseas in taiwan  israel  china  south korea and japan 
we may  therefore  be affected by the political  economic and military conditions in these countries 
specifically  china does not currently have a comprehensive and highly developed legal system  particularly with respect to the protection of intellectual property rights 
this results  among other things  in the prevalence of counterfeit goods in china 
the enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts remains uncertain  and the implementation and interpretation of such laws may be inconsistent 
such inconsistency could lead to piracy and degradation of our intellectual property protection 
our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed by the sale of counterfeit products 
our international business activities could also be limited or disrupted by any of the following factors the need to comply with foreign government regulation  general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our business  particularly japan  such as the earthquakes experienced in taiwan in  in japan in  and previous years  and in china in previous years  
table of contents reduced sales to our customers or interruption to our manufacturing processes in the pacific rim that may arise from regional issues in asia  imposition of regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  imposition of additional duties  charges and or fees related to customs entries for our products  which are all manufactured offshore  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  adverse tax rules and regulations  weak protection of our intellectual property rights  and delays in product shipments due to local customs restrictions 
our products may contain errors or defects  which could result in the rejection of our products  product recalls  damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased service costs and warranty claims and litigation 
our products are complex  must meet stringent user requirements  may contain errors or defects and the majority of our products are warrantied for one to five years 
these factors could result in the rejection of our products  damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources  increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims and litigation 
we provide an allowance for warranty and similar costs in connection with sales of our product  but actual warranty and similar costs may be significantly higher than our recorded estimates resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our new products have from time to time been introduced with design and production errors at a rate higher than the error rate in our established products 
we must estimate warranty and similar costs for new products without historical information and actual costs may significantly exceed our recorded estimates 
under estimation of our warranty and similar costs would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
tower semiconductor s financial situation is challenging 
tower supplies a significant portion of our controller wafers from its fab facility and is currently a sole source of supply for some of our controllers 
tower s fab is operational but has not been completed and continued supply of controllers to us on a cost effective basis may be dependent on this completion 
tower s completion of the equipment installation  technology transfer and ramp up of production at fab is dependent upon tower a having sufficient funds to complete the fab project  b meeting the conditions to receive israeli government grants and tax benefits approved for fab  and c obtaining the approval of the israeli investment center to extend the five year investment period under its fab approved enterprise program 
in addition  tower is required to comply with financial ratios and covenants to avoid being in default under its amended bank credit agreements 
if tower is unable to satisfy these requirements  we will be forced to source our controllers from another supplier and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely effected 
specifically  our ability to supply a number of products would be disrupted until we were able to transition manufacturing and qualify a new foundry with respect to controllers that are currently sole sourced at tower 
we have recognized cumulative losses of approximately million as a result of the other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in tower ordinary shares  million as a result of the impairment in value on our prepaid wafer credits and million of losses on our warrant to purchase tower ordinary shares 
of the approximately million tower ordinary shares we own  we have agreed not to sell approximately million shares until on or after january  it is possible that we will record further write downs of our investment  which was carried on our consolidated balance sheet at million as of january   which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our stock price has been  and may continue to be  volatile  which could result in investors losing all or part of their investments 
the market price of our stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
we believe that such fluctuations will continue as a result of many factors  including future announcements concerning us  our competitors or principal customers regarding financial results  technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations  litigation or changes in earnings estimates by analysts 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of high technology and semiconductor companies have been especially volatile  often for reasons outside the control of the particular companies 
these fluctuations as well as general economic  political and market conditions may have an adverse affect on the market price of our common stock 
we may make acquisitions that are dilutive to existing stockholders  result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations  and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses 
we continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise  including business combinations  strategic partnerships  collaborations  capital investments and the purchase  licensing or sale of assets 
if we issue equity securities in connection with an acquisition  the issuance may be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
alternatively  acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash would reduce our cash reserves 
acquisitions may require significant capital infusions  typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies 
we may experience delays in the timing and successful integration of acquired technologies and product development through volume production  unanticipated costs and expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  or contractual  intellectual property or employment issues 
in addition  key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also result in our entering into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 
these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
these challenges are magnified as the size of the acquisition increases  and we cannot assure you that we will realize the intended benefits of any acquisition 
furthermore  acquisitions may require large one time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges  the amortization of identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our success depends on key personnel  including our executive officers  the loss of whom could disrupt our business 
our success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key research and development  sales  marketing and operations personnel  including dr 
eli harari  our founder  president and chief executive officer 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers and they are free to terminate their employment with us at any time 
our success will also depend on our ability to recruit additional highly skilled personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining key personnel  or that any of our key personnel will remain employed with us 
we expect to raise additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain  and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts may prevent us from increasing our wafer supply  developing or enhancing our products  taking advantage of future opportunities  growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could harm our business 
we currently believe that we have sufficient cash resources to fund our operations as well as our investments in flash partners and flashvision for at least the next twelve months  however  we expect to raise additional funds  including funds to meet our obligations with respect to flash partners and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
from time to time  we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt  equity or lease financings 
if we issue additional equity securities  our stockholders will experience dilution and the new equity securities may have rights  
table of contents preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock or debt securities 
if we raise funds through debt or lease financing  we will have to pay interest and may be subject to restrictive covenants  which could harm our business 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  fulfill our obligations to flash partners  take advantage of future opportunities  grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could have a negative impact on our business 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents  stockholder rights plan and in delaware law could discourage or delay a change in control and  as a result  negatively impact our stockholders 
we have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt 
for example  we have a stockholders rights plan that would cause substantial dilution to a stockholder  and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder  who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
this could discourage an acquisition of us 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation grants our board of directors the authority to fix the rights  preferences and privileges of and issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder action  of which have already been reserved under our stockholder rights plan 
issuing preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult and less attractive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
preferred stock may also have other rights  including economic rights senior to our common stock that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
this section provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three year period following the time that a stockholder became an interested stockholder 
this provision could have the effect of delaying or discouraging a change of control of sandisk 
changes in securities laws and regulations have increased our costs  further  in the event we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls  or if these internal controls over financial reporting are not effective  our business could suffer 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july required changes in our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
the number of rules and regulations applicable to us have increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs  and have made some activities more difficult  such as stockholder approval of new option plans 
in addition  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with compliance with section of that law regarding internal controls over financial reporting 
these laws and regulations and perceived increased risk of liability could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
we cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
in connection with our certification process under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we have identified and will from time to time identify a number of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting 
we cannot assure you that individually or in the aggregate these deficiencies would not be deemed to be a material weakness 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement enhancements on a timely basis in order to prevent a failure of our internal controls or enable us to furnish future unqualified certifications 
a material weakness or deficiency in internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our reported financial results and the market price of our stock could significantly decline 
additionally  adverse publicity related to the disclosure of a material weakness or deficiency in internal controls over financial reporting could have a negative impact on our reputation  business and stock price 
any internal control or procedure  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices 

table of contents interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
as of january   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities 
foreign currency risk 
a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activity is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen 
movements in currency exchange rates  especially the japanese yen  could cause variability in our revenues  expenses or other income expense  net 
see factors that may affect future results we are exposed to foreign currency risks and factors that may affect future results because of our international business and operations  we must comply with numerous international laws and regulations  and we are vulnerable to political instability  currency fluctuations and other risks related to international operations 
market risk 
we also hold available for sale equity securities in equity investments in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies 
as of january   a reduction in prices of of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately million 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at january  actual results may differ materially
