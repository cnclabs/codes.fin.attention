item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction as used in this report  the terms we  us  our  the company and nathan s mean nathan s famous  inc and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates a different meaning 
during the fiscal year ended march   we completed two acquisitions that provided us with two highly recognized brands 
on april   we became the franchisor of the kenny rogers roasters restaurant system by acquiring the intellectual property rights  including trademarks  recipes and franchise agreements of roasters corp 
and roasters franchise corp 
on september   we acquired the remaining of the outstanding common stock of miami subs corporation we did not already own 
our revenues are generated primarily from operating company owned restaurants and franchising the nathan s  miami subs and kenny rogers restaurant concepts  selling products under nathan s branded product program and licensing agreements for the sale of nathan s products within supermarkets 
the branded product program enables foodservice operators to offer nathans hot dogs and other proprietary items for sale within their facilities 
in conjunction with this program  foodservice operators are granted a limited use of the nathans trademark with respect to the sale of hot dogs and certain other proprietary food items and paper goods 
in addition to plans for expansion through franchising and our branded product program  nathan s continues to co brand within its existing restaurant system 
currently  the arthur treacher s brand is being sold within nathan s  kenny rogers roasters and miami subs restaurants  the nathan s brand is included on the menu of miami subs and kenny rogers restaurants  while the kenny rogers roasters brand is being sold within miami subs and nathan s restaurants

at march   our company owned restaurant system included six nathan s units  as compared to seven nathan s units at march  critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgement due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for impairment 
the most significant assumptions which are used in this test are estimates of future cash flows 
we typically use the same assumptions for this test as we use in the development of our business plans 
if these assumptions differ significantly from actual results  additional impairment charges may be required in the future 
in the first quarter of fiscal  nathan s adopted sfas no 
in connection with the implementation of this new standard in fiscal  goodwill  trademarks  trade names and recipes were deemed to be impaired and their carrying value was written down by  or  net of an income tax benefit of  no goodwill or other intangible assets were determined to be impaired during the fifty two week periods ended march  or march  impairment of long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
requires management judgements regarding the future operating and disposition plans for underperforming assets  and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold 
the application of sfas no 
has affected the amounts and timing of charges to operating results in recent years 
we evaluate possible impairment of each restaurant individually  and record an impairment charge whenever we determine that impairment factors exist 
we consider a history of restaurant operating losses to be the primary indicator of potential impairment of a restaurant s carrying value 
during the fifty two week period ended march   no impairment charges on long lived assets were recorded 
during the fifty two week period ended march   we identified one restaurant that had been impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately  during the fifty two weeks ended march   we identified seven restaurants that had been impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately impairment of notes receivable statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended  requires management judgements regarding the future collectibility of notes receivable and the underlying fair market value of collateral 
we consider the following factors when evaluating a note for impairment a indications that the borrower is experiencing business problems  such as operating losses  marginal working capital  inadequate cash flow or business interruptions  b whether the loan is secured by collateral that is not readily marketable  and or c whether the collateral is susceptible to deterioration in realizable value 
when determining possible impairment  we also assess our future intention to extend certain leases beyond the minimum lease term and the debtor s ability to meet its obligation over the projected term 
during the fifty two week period ended march   no impairment charges on notes receivable were recorded 
we previously identified certain notes receivable that had been impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately  relating to two notes and  relating to nine notes during the fifty two weeks ended march  and march   respectively 
revenue recognition sales by company owned restaurants  which are typically paid in cash by the customer  are recognized upon the performance of services 
in connection with its franchising operations  the company receives initial franchise fees  development fees  royalties  contributions to marketing funds  and in certain cases  revenue from sub leasing restaurant properties to franchisees 
franchise and area development fees  which are typically received prior to completion of the revenue recognition process  are recorded as deferred revenue 
initial franchise fees  which are non refundable  are recognized as income when substantially all services to be performed by nathan s and conditions relating to the sale of the franchise have been performed or satisfied  which generally occurs when the franchised restaurant commences operations 
the following services are typically provided by the company prior to the opening of a franchised restaurant o approval of all site selections to be developed 
o provision of architectural plans suitable for restaurants to be developed 
o assistance in establishing building design specifications  reviewing construction compliance and equipping the restaurant 
o provision of appropriate menus to coordinate with the restaurant design and location to be developed 
o provide management training for the new franchisee and selected staff 
o assistance with the initial operations of restaurants being developed 
development fees are non refundable and the related agreements require the franchisee to open a specified number of restaurants in the development area within a specified time period or the agreements may be canceled by the company 
revenue from development agreements is deferred and recognized as restaurants in the development area commence operations on a pro rata basis to the minimum number of restaurants required to be open  or at the time the development agreement is effectively canceled 
nathan s recognizes franchise royalties when they are earned and deemed collectible 
franchise fees and royalties that are not deemed to be collectible are not recognized as revenue until paid by the franchisee  or until collectibility is deemed to be reasonably assured 
the number of non performing units are determined by analyzing the number of months that royalties have been paid during a period 
when royalties have been paid for less then the majority of the time frame reported  such location is deemed non performing 
accordingly  the number of non performing units may differ between the quarterly results and year to date results 
revenue from sub leasing properties is recognized as income as the revenue is earned and becomes receivable and deemed collectible 
sub lease rental income is presented net of associated lease costs in the consolidated statements of operations 
nathan s recognizes revenue from the branded product program when it is determined that the products have been delivered via third party common carrier to nathans customers 
nathan s recognizes revenue from royalties on the licensing of the use of its name on certain products produced and sold by outside vendors 
the use of nathans name and symbols must be approved by nathan s prior to each specific application to ensure proper quality and project a consistent image 
revenue from license royalties is recognized when it is earned and deemed collectible 
in the normal course of business  we extend credit to franchisees for the payment of ongoing royalties and to trade customers of our branded product program 
notes and accounts receivable  net  as shown on our consolidated balance sheets are net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessment of collectibility based upon historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
in the event that the collectibility of a receivable at the date of the transaction is doubtful  the associated revenue is not recorded until the facts and circumstances change in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
self insurance liabilities we are self insured for portions of our general liability coverage 
as part of our risk management strategy  our insurance programs include deductibles for each incident and in the aggregate for each policy year 
as such  we accrue estimates of our ultimate self insurance costs throughout the policy year 
these estimates have been developed based upon our historical trends  however  the final cost of many of these claims may not be known for five years or longer 
accordingly  our annual self insurance costs may be subject to adjustment from previous estimates as facts and circumstances change 
the self insurance accrual at march  and march  was  and  respectively 
during the fifty two weeks ended march   we reversed approximately  of previously recorded insurance accruals to reflect the revised estimated cost of claims 
also  during the fifty two weeks ended march   we reversed approximately  of previously recorded insurance accruals for items that have been concluded without further payment 
finally  during the fifty two weeks ended march   we completed an evaluation of the outstanding claims and reserves in conjunction with our external risk manager and reversed  of previously recorded self insurance accruals for those claims on which our exposure had been settled

which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized 
such goodwill amortization was not tax deductible by nathan s which increased the effective tax rate in prior years

pursuant to its stock repurchase program  it repurchased one million shares of common stock in open market transactions and a private transaction at a total cost of  through the quarter ended september  on october   nathan s was authorized to purchase up to one million additional shares of its common stock 
through march   nathan s purchased  shares of common stock at a cost of approximately  which includes the repurchase of  shares during the fifty two weeks ended march  at a cost of  as of march   nathan s has purchased a total of  shares of common stock at a cost of approximately  nathan s expects to make additional purchases of stock from time to time  depending on market conditions  in open market or in privately negotiated transactions  at prices deemed appropriate by management 
there is no set time limit on the purchases 
nathan s expects to fund these stock repurchases from its operating cash flow 
we expect that we will make additional investments in certain existing restaurants and support the growth of the branded product program in the future and to fund those investments from our operating cash flow 
we may incur additional capital expenditures in connection with the replacement of a company owned restaurant whose lease expired in september there are currently properties that we either own or lease from third parties which we lease or sublease to franchisees  operating managers and non franchisees 
additionally  there is currently one leased vacant property which was previously sublet to a franchisee 
we remain contingently liable for all costs associated with these properties including rent  property taxes and insurance 
additionally  we guaranteed financing on behalf of certain franchisees with two third party lenders 
our maximum obligation for loans funded by the lenders as of march  was approximately  we may incur future cash payments  consisting primarily of future lease payments  including costs and expenses associated with terminating additional leases  that were not part of our divestiture plan 
the following schedules represent nathan s cash contractual obligations and the expiration of other contractual commitments by maturity in thousands payments due by period less than cash contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations employment agreements  operating leases      gross cash contractual obligations      less sublease income      net cash contractual obligations     amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than other contractual commitments committed year years years after years loan guarantees total commercial commitments management believes that available cash  marketable investment securities  and internally generated funds should provide sufficient capital to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we currently maintain a  uncommitted bank line of credit and have never borrowed any funds under the company s lines of credit 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations  the effects of weather and economic conditions 
historically  restaurant sales from company owned restaurants  franchised restaurants from which royalties are earned and the company s earnings have been highest during our first two fiscal quarters with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to weather conditions in our marketplace for our company owned and franchised nathan s restaurants  which is principally the new york metropolitan area 
as a result of the changing composition of the miami subs restaurant system  sales  and the resulting royalties derived  are less seasonally dependant despite the ongoing concentration of restaurants being located in florida 
notwithstanding the continued growth of our branded product program and the reduced number of our restaurants  we believe that future revenues and profits will continue to be highest during our first two fiscal quarters with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period 
inflationary impact we believe that general inflation has not materially impacted earnings during the past three years 
nevertheless  during that period of time  our commodity costs for beef have increased significantly while other costs have increased slightly 
beginning with fiscal  throughout fiscal and into the first quarter fiscal  the price of our beef products has risen dramatically over historical norms  particularly as compared to fiscal as previously discussed  nathan s has increased prices in response to the increased commodity costs 
in addition  during fiscal and fiscal we have realized the impact of higher oil prices in the form of higher distribution costs and utilities 
further  in various federal and new york state legislators proposed changes to the minimum wage requirements  however  none of the proposals were enacted 
although we only operate six company owned restaurants  we believe that significant increases in the minimum wage could have a significant financial impact on our financial results and the results of our franchisees 
continued increases in labor  food and other operating expenses could adversely affect our operations and those of the restaurant industry and we might have to further reconsider our pricing strategy as a means to offset reduced operating margins 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents we have historically invested our cash and cash equivalents in short term  fixed rate  highly rated and highly liquid instruments which are reinvested when they mature throughout the year 
although our existing investments are not considered at risk with respect to changes in interest rates or markets for these instruments  our rate of return on short term investments could be affected at the time of reinvestment as a result of intervening events 
as of march   nathans cash and cash equivalents aggregated  earnings on these cash and cash equivalents would increase or decrease by approximately  per annum for each change in interest rates 
marketable investment securities we have invested our marketable investment securities in intermediate term  fixed rate  highly rated and highly liquid instruments 
these investments are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
as of march   the market value of nathans marketable investment securities aggregated  interest income on these marketable investment securities would increase or decrease by approximately  per annum for each change in interest rates 
the following chart presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value of the marketable investment securities held at march  that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations in thousands valuation of securities valuation of securities given an interest rate given an interest rate decrease of x basis points fair increase of x basis points bps bps bps value bps bps bps municipal notes and bonds        borrowings the interest rate on our borrowings is generally determined based upon the prime rate and may be subject to market fluctuation as the prime rate changes as determined within each specific agreement 
we do not anticipate entering into interest rate swaps or other financial instruments to hedge our borrowings 
at march   total outstanding debt  including capital leases  aggregated  of which  is at risk due to changes in interest rates 
the current interest rate is per annum and will adjust in january and january to prime plus 
nathan s also maintains a  credit line at the prime rate as of may  
the company has never borrowed any funds under its credit lines 
accordingly  the company does not believe that fluctuations in interest rates would have a material impact on its financial results 
commodity costs the cost of commodities are subject to market fluctuation 
we have not attempted to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of the commodities we purchase using future  forward  option or other instruments 
as a result  our future commodities purchases are subject to changes in the prices of such commodities 
generally  we attempt to pass through permanent increases in our commodity prices to our customers  thereby reducing the impact of long term increases on our financial results 
during the fifty two week periods ended march  and march   the price of our beef products has risen dramatically over historical norms  particularly as compared to the fiscal year ended march the increases have been caused by reductions in the supply of beef primarily due to the prohibition since may on importing of canadian beef livestock into the us  the decrease in imports of australian beef due to local drought conditions and the export of united states beef had increased through december  when the first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  otherwise known as bse in the united states was reported 
nathan s has not experienced a softening in the price of beef since december  although the export of beef by the united states was significantly reduced as a result of this finding  beef costs have continued to rise 
in march  the bush administration was expected to re open the canadian border and resume importing canadian beef  which has not occurred 
as a result  supply continues to be tight and prices remain unrelentingly high 
nathan s cost of its hot dogs was approximately higher during the fifty two weeks ended march  than the fifty two weeks ended march   which is in addition to an approximately increase over the fifty two weeks ended march  nathan s has already been forced to increase menu prices in its company operated restaurants and had increased prices within its branded product program to offset some of the margin pressure 
a short term increase or decrease of in the cost of our food and paper products for the entire fifty two weeks ended march  would have increased or decreased cost of sales by approximately on december   the united states department of agriculture usda announced that the first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  otherwise known as bse  or mad cow disease was discovered in the united states in a single cow in the state of washington 
nathan s has obtained written assurances from its beef processors that nathan s products have not come from the meat processing plants associated with the production of products having to do with this incident 
nathan s demand for its products continues to be strong and nathan s has not experienced any material sales impact in connection with this incident 
foreign currencies foreign franchisees generally conduct business with us and make payments in united states dollars  reducing the risks inherent with changes in the values of foreign currencies 
as a result  we have not purchased future contracts  options or other instruments to hedge against changes in values of foreign currencies and we do not believe fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies would have a material impact on our financial results
