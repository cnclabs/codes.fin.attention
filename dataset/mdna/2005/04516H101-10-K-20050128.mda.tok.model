critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release numbers  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that affect its significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
based on its terms of fob shipping point  where risk of loss and title transfer to the buyer at the time of shipment  the company recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped or  for company stores  at the point of sale 
the company records sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
under these guidelines  revenue is recognized when all of the following exist persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
the company also includes payments from its customers for shipping and handling in its net revenues line item in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting of shipping and handling fees and costs 
provisions are made for estimated sales returns and other allowances 
sales returns  markdowns and other allowances 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenues 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  and sell through of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenues for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
the reserves for sales returns  markdowns and other allowances amounted to million at october  compared to 
million at october  the increase is primarily related to providing additional markdown allowances for the additional retail sales  as well as the allowances acquired in the acquisition of gekko 
during the year ended october   the company adjusted the assumptions underlying the estimate for markdown allowances for its retail sales to provide additional markdown allowances based on the historical experience in the retail channel 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management must also make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
management determines the adequacy of this allowance by analyzing current economic conditions  historical bad debts and continually evaluating individual customer receivables while considering the customer s financial condition 
the company has credit insurance to cover many of its major accounts 
our trade accounts receivable balance 
table of contents was million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million  at october  as compared to the balance of million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million at october  allowances for doubtful accounts as a percentage of trade accounts receivable decreased to at october  from at october  the decrease in allowances for doubtful accounts as a percentage of trade accounts receivable during fiscal was primarily the result of a decrease in the dollar amount of delinquent accounts 
inventory 
the company writes down its inventory by amounts equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about the age of the inventory  future demand  and market conditions 
this process provides for a new basis for the inventory until it is sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory balance was million  net of inventory write downs of 
million at october   as compared to an inventory balance of million  net of write downs of million at october  without the addition of gekko brands  llc  gekko  the inventory balance would have remained relatively unchanged compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the inventory write downs is primarily attributed to a decrease in the domestic noncurrent level of the ashworth and callaway golf apparel inventory 
asset purchase credits 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with a third party whereby prior seasons slower selling inventory which was not damaged was exchanged for future asset purchase credits apcs  which may be utilized by the company to purchase future goods and services over a four year period 
the original value of the inventory exchanged at cost was million resulting in million in future apcs 
in december  the company amended its agreement with the third party to exchange million of additional prior seasons slower selling inventory at cost for an additional million in future apcs and an extension of the original november agreement through december the company has entered into contracts with several third party suppliers who have agreed to accept these apcs  in part  as payment for goods and services 
the company purchases products such as sales fixtures  office and packaging supplies  as well as temporary help  freight and printing services from such third party suppliers 
from time to time the company may enter into additional contracts with such third party suppliers to use the apcs 
management reviews and estimates the likelihood of fully utilizing the apcs on a periodic basis 
if the company is unable to find suppliers who agree to accept the apcs in quantities as projected by management  a write down of the value of the apcs may be required 
at october   the company had million of the apcs remaining and management expects to fully utilize them over the remaining life of the contract through december off balance sheet arrangements at october  and  the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

as such  the company is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
the statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
the cost of employee services received shall be measured at its then current fair value and then remeasured at fair value at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
the statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the statement also requires that  as of the required effective date  all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under statement shall apply the modified prospective application transition method

foreign currency exchange rate risk the company s ability to sell its products in foreign markets and the us dollar value of the sales made in foreign currencies can be significantly influenced by foreign currency fluctuations 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could result in downward price pressure for the company s products or losses from currency exchange rates 
from time to time the company and its uk subsidiary enter into short term foreign exchange contracts with its bank to hedge against the impact of currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the british pound 
the contracts provide that  on specified dates  the company would sell the bank a specified number of british pounds in exchange for a specified number of us dollars 
additionally  the company s subsidiary in england from time to time enters into similar contracts with its bank to hedge against currency fluctuations between the british pound and other european currencies 
realized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as the 
table of contents hedged transaction 
these contracts have maturity dates that do not normally exceed months 
the company will continue to assess the benefits and risks of strategies to manage the risks presented by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
there is no assurance that any strategy will be successful in avoiding losses due to exchange rate fluctuations  or that the failure to manage currency risks effectively would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
on july   the company s uk subsidiary entered into four forward exchange contracts to sell british pounds and buy u 
s 
dollars  as well as five forward exchange contracts to sell euros and buy british pounds 
at october   the company had settled all of its forward foreign exchange contracts
