item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
mission our mission is to develop diversified and highly profitable community focused  banking operations in the markets of the central coast of california  the kansas city metro  and the phoenix scottsdale metro 
although these markets are geographically dispersed  we have considerable market knowledge of each of these areas  local management with extensive experience in banking and the particular market  relationship development potential due to our ties to the communities  and each market offers favorable demographic and economic characteristics 
all of these banking operations are operated under the los padres bank  fsb charter so that we can gain operating efficiencies from centralized administration and operating systems 
however  each region s banking operation is distinct to its market and its clientele  and lead by a local management team responsible for developing and expanding the banking operations on a profitable basis 
the kansas city banking offices operate under the harrington bank dba brand name  and the california and arizona offices operate under the los padres bank brand name 
multiple market strategy we believe this multiple market banking strategy provides the following benefits to our shareholders diversification of the loan portfolio and economic and credit risk 
options to capitalize on the most favorable growth markets 
the capability to deploy the company s diversified product mix and emphasize those products that are best suited for the market 

table of contents the ability to price products strategically among the markets in an attempt to maximize profitability 
we plan to grow the banking operations in these markets opportunistically and expect the opening of two to three banking offices every months through new branching 
we evaluate financial institution acquisition opportunities but are value oriented 
acquisitions are expected to be accretive to earnings per share within a month period 
since  we have grown from banking offices to banking offices after the completion of the thousand oaks deposit acquisition and the opening of the scottsdale airpark office by mid we will have full service banking offices on the central coast of california from ventura to atascadero along highway  banking offices in johnson county  kansas in the fastest growing area of the kansas city metro  and offices in scottsdale  arizona  when the second office is completed and opened in the scottsdale airpark in early we are working on additional expansion opportunities in each market 
product line diversification we have broadened our product lines over the last years to diversify our revenue sources and to become a full service community banking company 
in  we added harrington wealth management company  a federally registered trust and investment management company  to provide our customers a consultative and customized investment process for their trust and investment funds 
in  we added a full line of commercial banking and deposit products for small to medium sized businesses and expanded our consumer lending lines to provide home equity lines of credit 
in  we added internet banking and bill pay services to augment our in branch services and consultation 
in  we further expanded our mortgage banking and brokerage activities in all of our markets 
modern financial skills we believe we have considerable expertise in investment and asset liability management from the ceo s background in this field for years  wherein he spent years consulting on risk management practices with banking institutions and advising on billions of mortgage assets managed on a short duration basis 
we attempt to control interest rate risk to a low level through the use of interest rate risk management tools  and we utilize excess capital in a low duration and high credit quality investment portfolio of largely mortgage related securities to enhance our earnings 
our goal is to produce a pre tax return on these investments of to over the related funding sources 
we believe our ability to price loans and investments on an option adjusted spread basis and then manage the interest rate risk of longer term  fixed rate loans allows us to compete effectively against other institutions  who can not offer these products due to their inability to manage the interest rate risk 
control banking risks we seek to control banking risks 
we have established a disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting environment that emphasizes the assessment of collateral support  cash flows  guarantor support  and stress testing 
we manage operational risk through stringent policies  procedures  and controls and interest rate risk through our modern financial and hedging skills 

table of contents performance measurement we evaluate our performance based upon the primary measures of return on average equity  which we are trying to maintain in the mid teens  earnings per share growth  and additional franchise value creation through the growth of deposits  loans and wealth management assets 
profitability drivers the factors that we expect to drive our profitability in the future are as follows changing the mix of our loans to higher risk adjusted spread earning categories such as business lending  commercial real estate lending  small tract construction and construction to permanent loan lending  and selected consumer lending activities such as home equity line of credit loans 
the following pie charts illustrate the change in the loan mix to higher spread earning loan categories from december  to december  at december   lower margin  single family loans were of the loan portfolio compared to at december  commercial real estate loans are of the loan portfolio as of december  versus of the loan portfolio in december  commercial and industrial loans have increased to of our loan portfolio as of december  from just in december  pie chart pie chart

the effect of these factors on our financial results is discussed further in the following sections 

table of contents critical accounting policies general 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
the financial information contained in our consolidated financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when recognizing income or expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors to determine the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
we also calculate the fair value of our interest rate contracts and securities based on market prices and the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
we enter into interest rate contracts that are classified as trading account assets or to accommodate our own risk management purposes 
the interest rate contracts are generally interest swaps  caps  floors and futures contracts  although we could enter into other types of interest rate contracts 
we value these contracts at fair value  using readily available  and market quoted prices 
we have not historically entered into derivative contracts  which relate to credit  equity  commodity  energy or weather related indices 
generally accepted accounting principles themselves may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
as of december   we have not created any special purpose entities to securitize assets or to obtain off balance sheet funding 
although we have sold loans in past years  those loans have been sold to third parties without recourse  subject to customary representations and warranties 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  and ii sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has four components i an allocated allowance for specifically identified problem loans  ii a formula allowance for non homogenous loans  iii an allocated allowance for large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans and iv an unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses a model based on historical losses as an indicator of future losses and as a result could differ from the losses incurred in the future  however  since this history is updated with the most recent loss information  the differences that might otherwise occur may be mitigated 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
historical loss information  discounted cash flows  fair market value of collateral and secondary market information are all used to estimate those losses 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the unallocated allowance captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose 
table of contents impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowances 
trading and investment portfolio 
substantially all of our securities are classified as available for sale securities and  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders equity 
we invest in a portfolio of mortgage backed and related securities  interest rate contracts  us government agency securities and  to a much lesser extent  equity securities 
the company has also entered into various total return swaps in an effort to enhance income  where cash flows are based on the level and changes in the yield spread on investment grade commercial mortgage backed security indexes relative to similar duration libor swap rates 
these swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are included in the trading account assets and are reported at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses on these instruments recognized in income loss from trading account assets  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
hedging activity 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was implemented on january  sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize all interest rate contracts as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial condition and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  an interest rate contract may be specifically designated as a fair value hedge  a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of foreign currency exposure 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of an interest rate contract that is  gains and losses depends on the intended use of the interest rate contract and the resulting designation 
to qualify for hedge accounting  the company must show that  at the inception of the interest rate contracts  and on an ongoing basis  the changes in the fair value of the interest rate contracts are expected to be highly effective in offsetting related changes in the cash flows of the hedged liabilities 
the company has entered into various interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging certain of its short term liabilities 
these interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting 
accordingly  the effective portion of the accumulated change in the fair value of the cash flow hedges is recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax  while the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings immediately 
results of operations summary of earnings 
we reported net income for the year ended december  of million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and our net income improved by thousand or during as compared to and million or in as compared to on a diluted earnings per share basis  we earned   and for the years ended december   and  respectively

net interest income 
net interest income is determined by our interest rate margin  which is the difference between the yields earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income increased by million or to million during the year ended december  over the increase in net interest income is partly due to a million or increase in the average balance of interest earning assets  while the interest rate margin decreased slightly by basis points to for from for the decline in net interest margin reflects the slight lag in the repricing of floating rate borrowings and floating rate loans and hedges  and the prepayment of higher rate loans

cash and cash equivalents  consisting of cash and due from banks and federal funds sold  amounted to million at december   and million at december  we manage our cash and cash equivalents based upon our operating  investing and financing activities 
we generally attempt to invest our excess liquidity into higher yielding assets such as loans or securities 
see liquidity and capital resources 
securities 
in order to limit our credit risk exposure and to earn an incremental income  we maintain a significant portion of our assets in various types of securities  consisting primarily of investment grade mortgage backed securities and cmos  and remics  which we collectively refer to as mortgage backed and related securities 
our securities portfolio also includes  to a lesser extent  us government securities 
at december   our securities portfolio  which is comprised of securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity  amounted to million or of our total assets 
mortgage backed and related securities  which are the principal components of our securities portfolio  often carry lower yields than traditional mortgage loans 
these types of securities  however  generally increase the quality of our assets by virtue of the securities underlying insurance or guarantees  require less capital under risk based regulatory capital requirements than non insured or non guaranteed mortgage loans  are more liquid than individual mortgage loans  which enhances our ability to actively manage our portfolio  and may be used to collateralize borrowings or other obligations we incur

prepaid expenses and other assets 
at december   prepaid expenses and other assets amounted to million  as compared to million as of december  the million or increase in prepaid expenses and other assets since december  reflected the increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses due to the additional banking office locations and expanded operations of the company 
deposits 
at december   deposits totaled million  as compared to million as of december  the million or increase in total deposits during the year ended december  was due to the deposit growth of million in our new banking offices in ventura  california and overland park  kansas  while we lost deposits in other offices as we decided not to match competition on high cost  rate sensitive deposits above our borrowing cost 
we attempt to manage our overall funding costs by evaluating all potential sources of funds  including retail deposits and short and long term borrowings  and identifying which particular source will result in an all in cost to us that meets our funding benchmark 
at the same time  los padres bank has attempted to price the deposits offered through its branch system in order to promote retail deposit growth and offer a wide array of deposit products to satisfy its customers 
in addition to providing a cost efficient funding source  these retail deposits provide a source of fee income and the ability to cross sell other products or services 
borrowings 
advances from the fhlb of san francisco amounted to million at december  and million at december  the increase in fhlb advances in was due to our increased utilization of such borrowings to fund our growth in loans and securities

stockholders equity 
our stockholders equity amounted to million at december   an increase of million from december  net income earned during largely contributed to the increase in stockholder s equity 
moreover  our stockholders equity was also affected by unrealized gains and losses on securities and interest rate contracts  dividends paid on our common stock  and the exercise of stock options 
asset and liability management in general  savings institutions are negatively affected by an increase in interest rates to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more rapidly than interest earning assets 
the lending activities of savings institutions have historically emphasized the origination of long term  fixed rate loans secured by single family residences  and the primary source of funds of such institutions has been deposits  which largely mature or are subject to repricing within a shorter period of time 
this factor has historically caused the income and market value of portfolio equity mvpe of savings institutions to be more volatile than other financial institutions 
mvpe is defined as the net present value of the cash flows from an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the mvpe is estimated by valuing our assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments under various interest rate scenarios 
the extent to which assets gain or lose value in relation to the gains or losses of liabilities determines the appreciation or depreciation in equity on a market value basis 
mvpe analysis is intended to evaluate the impact of immediate and sustained interest rate shifts of the current yield curve upon the market value of the current balance sheet 
while having liabilities that reprice more frequently than assets is generally beneficial to net interest income and mvpe in times of declining interest rates  such an asset liability mismatch is generally detrimental during periods of rising interest rates 
our management believes that its asset and liability management strategy  as discussed below  provides us with a competitive advantage over other financial institutions 
we believe that our ability to hedge our interest rate exposure through the use of various interest rate contracts provides us with the flexibility to acquire loans structured to meet our customer s preferences and investments that provide attractive net risk adjusted spreads  regardless of whether the customer s loan or our investment is fixed rate or adjustable rate or short term or long term 
similarly  we can choose a cost effective source of funds and subsequently engage in an interest rate swap or other hedging transaction so that the interest rate sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are more closely matched 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the board of directors of los padres bank 
the board of director s written policies and procedures are implemented by the asset and liability committee of los padres bank alco  which is comprised of los padres bank s chief executive officer  president chief financial officer  principal accounting officer  director of financial reporting and four non employee directors of los padres bank 
the alco meets at least eight times a year to review the sensitivity of los padres bank s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  investment opportunities  the performance of the investment portfolios  and prior purchase and sale activity of securities 
the alco also provides guidance to management on reducing interest rate risk and on investment strategy and retail pricing and funding decisions with respect to los padres bank s overall asset and liability composition 
the alco reviews los padres bank s liquidity  cash flow needs  interest rate sensitivity of investments  deposits and borrowings  core deposit activity  current market conditions and interest rates on both a local and national level in connection with fulfilling its responsibilities 

table of contents smith breeden provides consulting services to us regarding  among other things  the selection of our investments and borrowings  the pricing of loans and deposits  and the use of various interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate risk 
smith breeden is a consulting firm  which renders investment advice and asset and liability management service to financial institutions and management services to corporations  endowments and funds 
two of our directors are minority stockholders in and one is an officer of smith breeden 
the alco regularly reviews interest rate risk by utilizing analyses prepared by smith breeden with respect to the impact of alternative interest rate scenarios on net interest income and on los padres bank s mvpe 
the alco also reviews analyses prepared by smith breeden concerning the impact of changing market volatility  prepayment forecast error  and changes in option adjusted spreads and non parallel yield curve shifts 
in the absence of our hedging activities  our mvpe would decline as a result of a general increase in market rates of interest 
this decline would be due to the market values of our assets being more sensitive to interest rate fluctuations than are the market values of our liabilities due to our investment in and origination of generally longer term assets which are funded with shorter term liabilities 
consequently  the elasticity ie  the change in the market value of an asset or liability as a result of a change in interest rates of our assets is greater than the elasticity of our liabilities 
accordingly  the primary goal of our asset and liability management policy is to effectively increase the elasticity of our liabilities and or effectively contract the elasticity of our assets so that the respective elasticities are matched as closely as possible 
this elasticity adjustment can be accomplished internally by restructuring our balance sheet or externally by adjusting the elasticities of our assets and or liabilities through the use of interest rate contracts 
our strategy is to hedge either internally through the use of longer term certificates of deposit or less sensitive transaction deposits and fhlb advances or externally through the use of various interest rate contracts 
external hedging generally involves the use of interest rate swaps  caps  floors  options and futures 
the notional amount of interest rate contracts represents the underlying amount on which periodic cash flows are calculated and exchanged between counterparties 
however  this notional amount does not necessarily represent the principal amount of securities  which would effectively be hedged by that interest rate contract 
in selecting the type and amount of interest rate contract to utilize  we compare the elasticity of a particular contract to that of the securities to be hedged 
an interest rate contract with the appropriate offsetting elasticity could have a notional amount much greater than the face amount of the securities being hedged 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on january  sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize all interest rate contracts as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial condition and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  an interest rate contract may be specifically designated as a fair value hedge  a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of foreign currency exposure 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of an interest rate contract that is  gains and losses depends on the intended use of the interest rate contract and the resulting designation 
to qualify for hedge accounting  we must show that  at the inception of the interest rate contracts and on an ongoing basis  the changes in the fair value of the interest rate contracts are expected to be highly effective in offsetting related changes in the cash flows of the hedged liabilities 
we have entered into various interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging certain of our short term liabilities 
these interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting 
accordingly  the effective portion of the accumulated change in the fair value of the cash flow hedges is recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax  while the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings immediately 
we have also entered into various interest rate swaps which hedge a portion of our securities portfolio 
these swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting 
table of contents treatment and are included in the trading account assets and are reported at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses on these instruments recognized in income loss from trading account assets 
an interest rate swap is an agreement where one party agrees to pay a fixed rate of interest on a notional principal amount to a second party in exchange for receiving from the second party a variable rate of interest on the same notional amount for a predetermined period of time 
no actual assets are exchanged in a swap of this type and interest payments are generally netted 
these swaps are generally utilized by us to synthetically convert floating rate deposits and borrowings into fixed rate liabilities or convert fixed rate assets into adjustable rate instruments  in either case without having to sell or transfer the underlying liabilities or assets 
at december   we held interest rate swaps  which are utilized to hedge liabilities and which qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to sfas no 
and are included in other assets or other liabilities 
these swap agreements had an aggregate notional amount of million and maturities from january to october with respect to these agreements  we make fixed rate payments ranging from to and receive payments based upon three month libor 
these fixed pay swaps are used to effectively modify the interest rate sensitivity of a portion of los padres bank s short term libor correlated borrowings which include short term deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb advances 
the interest expense relating to these swaps was million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
this expense is included in interest expense on fhlb advances in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the approximate market value of these interest rate swaps was an unrealized loss of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
effective as of january   these gains and losses are reflected as a separate component in stockholders equity 
prior to such date  these gains and losses were not reflected on our statement of financial condition 
at december   we did not hold any interest rate swaps as trading account assets  except for certain interest rate swaps that we utilize in order to enhance our returns and not for the purpose of interest rate risk management 
an interest rate cap or an interest rate floor consists of a guarantee given by the issuer ie  a broker to the purchaser ie  us  in exchange for the payment of a premium 
this guarantee states that if interest rates rise above in the case of a cap or fall below in the case of a floor a specified rate on a specified interest rate index  the issuer will pay to the purchaser the difference between the then current market rate and the specified rate on a notional principal amount 
no funds are actually borrowed or repaid 
at december   we did not have any interest rate caps or floors which qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to sfas no 
such caps are sometimes used to effectively modify the interest rate sensitivity of a portion of los padres bank s short term libor correlated liabilities  which include short term deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb advances 
interest rate futures are commitments to either purchase or sell designated instruments at a future date for a specified price 
futures contracts are generally traded on an exchange are marked to market daily and are subject to initial and maintenance margin requirements 
we generally use day eurodollar certificates of deposit contracts eurodollar futures contracts which are priced off libor as well as treasury note and bond futures contracts 
we will from time to time agree to sell a specified number of contracts at a specified date 
to close out a contract  we will enter into an offsetting position to the original transaction 
if interest rates rise  the value of our short futures positions increase 
consequently  sales of futures contracts serve as a hedge against rising interest rates 
at december  and  we did not have any 
table of contents futures contracts 
we had total losses on our futures contracts of  for the year ended december  options are contracts  which grant the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a specified price 
generally  we will purchase options on financial futures to hedge the changing elasticity exhibited by mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the changing elasticity results from the ability of a borrower to prepay a mortgage or caps and floors on the underlying loans 
as market interest rates decline  borrowers are more likely to prepay their mortgages  shortening the elasticity of the mortgages 
consequently  where interest rates are declining  the value of mortgage loans or mortgage backed securities will increase at a slower rate than would be expected if borrowers did not have the ability to prepay their mortgage 
we are subject to the risk that our counterparties with respect to various interest rate contracts may default at or prior to maturity of a particular instrument 
in such a case  we might be unable to recover any unrealized gains with respect to a particular contract 
to reduce this potential risk  we generally deal with large  established investment brokerage firms when entering into these transactions 
in addition  we have a policy whereby we limit our unsecured exposure to any one counterparty to of los padres bank s equity during any two month period and of los padres bank s equity during any one month period 
the ots requires each thrift institution to calculate the estimated change in the institution s mvpe assuming an instantaneous  parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of to basis points either up or down in basis point increments 
the ots permits institutions to perform this mvpe analysis using their own internal model based upon reasonable assumptions 
smith breeden assists us in performing the required calculation of the sensitivity of our market value to changes in interest rates 
in estimating the market value of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  we utilize various prepayment assumptions  which vary  in accordance with historical experience  based upon the term  interest rate and other factors with respect to the underlying loans 
at december   these prepayment assumptions varied from to for fixed rate mortgages and mortgage backed securities and varied from to for adjustable rate mortgages and mortgage backed securities 

table of contents the following table sets forth at december   the estimated sensitivity of los padres bank s mvpe to parallel yield curve shifts using our internal market value calculation 
the table demonstrates the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities both before and after the inclusion of our interest rate contracts

based on our pre tax mvpe of million at december  the table set forth above does not purport to show the impact of interest rate changes on our equity under generally accepted accounting principles 
market value changes only impact our income statement or the balance sheet to the extent the affected instruments are marked to market  and over the life of the instruments  as an impact on recorded yields 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the liquidity of los padres bank  a consolidated subsidiary of the company is monitored closely for regulatory purposes at the bank level by calculating the ratio of cash  cash equivalents not committed  pledged or required to liquidate specific liabilities  investments and qualifying mortgage backed securities to the sum of total deposits plus borrowings payable within one year  was at december  at december   los padres bank s liquid assets totaled approximately million 
in general  the bank s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
the company s primary sources of internal liquidity consist of deposits  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans and mortgage backed and related securities  maturities of short term investments  sales of mortgage backed and related securities and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed and related securities amortization and maturing short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the company s external sources of liquidity consist of borrowings  primarily advances from the fhlb of san francisco and a revolving line of credit loan facility  which we maintain with two banks 
at december   we had million in fhlb advances and we had million of additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb of san francisco 
at december   our note payable under our revolving line of credit amounted to million and we had million of additional borrowing capacity under this loan facility 
on september   we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement  which reduced the libor margin range from to to to 
we pay interest on the outstanding amount of our borrowings from time to time under the credit agreement at an interest rate that adjusts based upon our compliance with certain financial criteria and our selection of an interest rate formula 
at our option  the 
table of contents interest rates per annum applicable to any particular borrowing under the credit agreement is either adjusted libor plus a margin ranging from to or the prime rate announced from time to time by harris trust and savings bank minus a margin ranging from to 
the factors that determine the amount of the margin include our core profitability and our non performing asset ratio 
we are currently at the most favorable pricing level under the credit agreement 
in each year  we also pay a commitment fee to the lenders equal to of the average daily un drawn portion of the borrowings available to us under the credit agreement for that year 
all of the covenants remain in place and are unchanged 
management believes that as of december   it was in compliance with all of such covenants and restrictions and does not anticipate that such covenants and restrictions will limit our operations 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally used to pay down short term borrowings 
on a longer term basis  we maintain a strategy of investing in various mortgage backed and related securities and loans 
we use our sources of funds primarily to meet our ongoing commitments  to pay maturing savings certificates and savings withdrawals  fund loan commitments and maintain a portfolio of mortgage backed and related securities as well as certain other investments 
at december   the total approved loan commitments outstanding amounted to million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december  totaled million and fhlb borrowings and repurchase agreements that are scheduled to mature within the same period amounted to million 
management believes that we have adequate resources to fund all of our commitments and the company could either adjust the rate of certificates of deposit in order to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments or replace such deposits with advances from the fhlb of san francisco if it proved to be cost effective to do so 
a substantial source of our income from which we service our debt  pay our obligations and from which we can pay dividends is the receipt of dividends from los padres bank 
the availability of dividends from los padres bank is limited by various statutes and regulations 
at december   los padres bank was permitted to pay up to million of dividends to us 
in order to make such dividend payment  los padres bank is required to provide days advance notice to the ots  during which time the ots may object to such dividend payment 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of los padres bank  and other factors  that the ots could object to the payment of dividends by los padres bank on the basis that the payment of such dividends is an unsafe or unsound practice 
in addition  we are also subject to restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under our revolving loan facility and capital securities financings 
in the event los padres bank is unable to pay dividends to us  we may not be able to service our debt  pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock 
the company has a revolving line of credit with a maximum borrowing capacity of million with a maturity of september  we anticipate to utilize this line of credit as growth opportunities develop and to provide working capital 
at december  and  the company was not indebted under its revolving line of credit 
the company also has the ability to enter into trust preferred securities to provide working capital to fund our continued expansion 
capital resources 
federally insured savings institutions such as los padres bank are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
los padres bank s failure to comply could also impact its overall assessment by the ots in future regulatory examinations  which  if adverse  could also impact its fdic insurance assessment 
the following table reflects as of december   los padres bank s actual levels of regulatory capital and the applicable regulatory capital requirements 

table of contents tangible capital tier leverage capital risk based capital amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands actual regulatory capital minimum regulatory capital excess regulatory capital the tangible capital is computed as a percentage of tangible assets and tier leverage capital is computed as a percentage of the adjusted total assets  both of which are million as of december

off balance sheet arrangements as discussed in the asset and liability management section above  we utilize external hedging transactions to effectively increase the elasticity of our liabilities and or effectively contract the elasticity of our assets so that the respective elasticities are matched as closely as possible with the use of external hedging 
external hedging generally involves the use of interest rate swaps  caps  floors  options and futures  which are off balance sheet arrangements 
we use interest rate swap instruments to effectuate our external hedging strategy 
at december   we held interest rate swaps  which are utilized to hedge liabilities and which qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to sfas no 
and are included in other assets or other 
table of contents liabilities 
these swap agreements had an aggregate notional amount of million and maturities from january to october the notional amount of interest rate contracts represents the underlying amount on which periodic cash flows are calculated and exchanged between counterparties 
however  this notional amount does not necessarily represent the principal amount of securities  which would effectively be hedged by that interest rate contract 
our interest rate swap instruments require that we make fixed rate payments ranging from to and receive payments based upon three month libor 
these fixed pay swaps are used to effectively modify the interest rate sensitivity of a portion of los padres bank s short term libor correlated borrowings which include short term deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb advances 
at december  and  the interest rate swaps listed below are hedging the interest rate risk of cash flows associated with short term fhlb advances and certificates of deposit with terms between six and twelve months 
these swaps qualify as cash flow hedges

the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these instruments are recognized immediately in other income 
los padres bank s exposure to credit risk from derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value of the instruments 
credit risk amounts represent the replacement cost los padres bank could incur should counterparties with contracts in a gain position completely fail to perform under the terms of those contracts 
counterparties are subject to the credit approval and credit monitoring policies and procedures of los padres bank 
los padres bank limits its credit exposure by entering into international swap dealer association isda master agreements with each counterparty 
isda master agreements set the legal framework for transactions with counterparties in over the counter derivative markets 
los padres bank only deals with counterparties that are investment grade 
los padres bank has unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit which are also considered off balance sheet arrangements 
a summary of these commitments is presented in the contractual obligations and commercial commitments section above 
inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this prospectus have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars except with respect to securities which are carried at market value  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of 
table of contents money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services

in december  the accounting standards executive committee of the aicpa issued statement of position no 
sop  accounting for certain loans of debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop addresses the accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and the cash flows expected to be collected from purchased loans or debt securities if those differences are attributable  in part  to credit quality  sop requires purchased loans and debt securities to be recorded initially at fair value based on the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected with no carryover of any valuation allowance previously recognized by the seller 
interest income should be recognized based on the effective yield from the cash flows to be collected 
to the extent that the purchased loans or debt securities experience subsequent deterioration in credit quality  a valuation allowance would be established for any additional cash flows that are not expected to be received 
however  if more cash flows subsequently are expected to be received than originally estimated  the effective yield would be adjusted on a prospective basis 
sop will be effective for loans and debt securities acquired after december  management does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operation and financial position 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and equity securities that are accounted for using the cost method specified in accounting policy board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
an investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
eitf outlines that an impairment would be considered other than temporary unless a the investor has the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of the fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment  and b evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
although not presumptive  a pattern of selling investments prior to the forecasted recovery of fair value may call into question the investor s intent 
in addition  the severity and duration of the impairment should also be considered in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued a proposed board directed fasb staff position  fsp eitf issue a  implementation guidance of the application of paragraph of eitf issue no 
the proposed fsp would provide implementation guidance with respect to debt securities that are impaired solely due to interest rates and or sector spreads and analyzed for other than temporary impairment under paragraph of issue the board also issued fsp eitf issue b which delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs of eitf the delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature 
adoption of this standard may cause the company to recognize under current guidance or to recognize such losses in earlier periods  especially those due to increases in interest rates 
since fluctuations in fair value for available for sale securities are already recorded in accumulative other comprehensive income loss  adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on stockholder s equity
