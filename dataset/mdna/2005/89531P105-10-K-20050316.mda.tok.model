all statements regarding our expected financial position and operating results  our business strategy  our financing plans  forecasted demographic and economic trends relating to our industry and similar matters are forward looking statements 
these statements can sometimes be identified by our use of forward looking words such as may  will  anticipate  estimate  expect or intend 
we cannot promise you that our expectations in such forward looking statements will turn out to be correct 
our actual results could be materially different from our expectations because of various factors  including the factors discussed under business risk factors in this report 
overview general 
the company s long term goals are to continue to be the leading producer of a superior non wood decking alternative products  to increase the company s market share of any market it serves  and to expand into new product categories and geographic markets 
the company s management considers both financial and non financial indicators and factors in measuring the company s progress in achieving its goals and as general guides for managing the company s operations 
management considers growth in net sales  gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses  and net income as key indicators of operating performance 
growth in net sales reflects consumer acceptance of composite decking  the demand for trex over competing products  the success of our branding strategy  the effectiveness of our distributors  and the strength of our dealer network and contractor franchise 
management emphasizes gross margin as a key measure of performance because it reflects the company s ability to price its products accurately and to manage effectively its manufacturing unit costs 
managing selling  general and administrative expenses is important to support profitable growth 
the company s investment in research and development activities enables it to enhance manufacturing operations  develop new products and analyze new technologies 
management considers net income to be a measure of the company s overall financial performance 
the company manages its liquidity and capital using measures that include total debt  total cash balances  the ratio of debt to total capitalization  the ratio of debt to ebitda  cash flow from operations and free cash flow  which management defines as cash flow from operations plus net cash used in or provided by investing and financing activities 
management uses these measures to guide it in finding the appropriate balance between sales growth  production  investments in working capital  manufacturing capacity  capital expenditures  and available financial resources to achieve the proper level of liquidity  leverage and capitalization 
management considers raw materials sourcing  manufacturing performance and utilization  market share and distribution as key non financial indicators 
raw materials sourcing includes maintaining availability at reasonable cost in order to provide a competitive cost advantage 
manufacturing performance includes production line efficiency  which can lead to unit cost reductions  and product quality  which is a critical element in ensuring customer satisfaction 
management believes that manufacturing utilization is a competitive advantage and supports net sales growth 
market share provides a measure of performance relative to that of our competitors and reflects product features  customer satisfaction  brand awareness and distribution 
the success of our distribution strategy is measured by the effectiveness of our distributors partners and the size of our dealer network and contractor franchise  all of which must continue to expand to support our net sales growth and to increase our market share 
in the last two years  the company expanded its product offerings by introducing the trex accents and trex brasilia decking product lines and the new trex designer series railing tm 
sales of the trex accents product  which was launched in the fourth quarter of  accounted for approximately of total gross sales in the 
table of contents fourth quarter of the company expects that demand for the trex brasilia product  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of  will grow as this product becomes generally available through the company s distribution channels 
in april  the company entered into an agreement with home depot  the world s leading home improvement retailer  to sell the company s decking products through home depot stores 
in june  the company began selling trex products through home depot in selected markets and making decking and railing products available nationally in home depot stores via special order through the company s existing distribution channels 
in  higher manufacturing unit costs contributed to a reduction in gross profit as a percentage of sales 
manufacturing unit costs increased because of higher raw material costs and lower utilization rates during certain periods 
managing raw materials costs and manufacturing performance was one of the company s principal operating objectives for the company purchased slightly less pe material in compared to  but higher prices for pe material and operating expenses related to the company s reprocessing plant on its winchester manufacturing site negatively affected manufacturing unit costs 
the company expects that new pe material sourcing and purchasing initiatives will be necessary for it to manage effectively its costs of pe material in future periods 
during  the company also focused on product quality initiatives to enhance the appearance of the entire product line 
these initiatives  which focused on board dimension and color consistency  also negatively affected manufacturing performance and utilization rates 
the resulting reduction in production rates in contributed to higher manufacturing unit costs by reducing the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
to support further growth  the company must maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity 
the company expects that production capacity at its two manufacturing sites and planned capacity at its third manufacturing site will be sufficient to meet anticipated demand for trex through the company continued to support its branding efforts through advertising campaigns in print publications and on television 
branding expenditures in increased million over of all the risks and uncertainties facing the company s business  management views the following as the most significant the company s ability to develop or increase market acceptance of trex  including new products and applications  the company s lack of product diversification and reliance on sales of trex wood polymer lumber  the company s plan to increase production levels  the company s current dependence on its two manufacturing sites to meet the demand for trex  the company s reliance on the supply of low cost raw materials used in its production process  the company s sensitivity to economic conditions  which influence the level of activity in home improvements and new home construction  the company s ability to manage its growth  the company s significant capital investments and ability to access the capital markets on acceptable terms  and the company s dependence on its largest distributors to market and sell its products 
a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties is set forth under the caption business risk factors in this report 
net sales 
net sales consists of sales and freight  net of returns and discounts 
the level of net sales is principally affected by sales volume and the prices paid for trex 
the company s branding and product differentiation strategy enables the company to command premium prices over wood and to maintain price stability for trex 
the prices for trex decking products have increased over the last three years at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
gross profit 
gross profit indicates the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of raw material costs  direct labor costs  manufacturing costs and freight 
raw material costs generally include the costs to purchase and transport waste waste wood fiber  pe material and pigmentation for coloring trex products 
direct labor costs include wages and benefits of personnel engaged in the manufacturing process 
manufacturing costs consist of costs of depreciation  utilities  maintenance supplies and repairs  indirect labor  including wages and benefits  and warehouse and equipment rental activities 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
the largest components of selling  general and administrative expenses are branding and other sales and marketing costs  which have increased significantly as the company has sought to build brand awareness of trex in the decking and railing market 
sales and marketing costs consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits paid to sales and marketing personnel  advertising expenses and other promotional costs 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in research and development  procurement  accounting and other business functions  office occupancy costs attributable to these functions  and professional fees 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses have varied from quarter to quarter due  in part  to the seasonality of the company s business 
critical accounting policies  estimates and risks and uncertainties our significant accounting policies are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies include the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly difficult  subjective or complex judgments in making estimates  and where these estimates can significantly affect our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as a result  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could be different from these estimates 
inventories 
the company believes that its quantity and mix of finished goods inventory will be saleable in the ordinary course of business and  accordingly  has not established significant reserves for slow moving products or obsolescence 
the company accounts for its inventories at the lower of cost last in  first out  or lifo or market value 
at december   the excess of the replacement cost of inventory over the lifo value of inventory was approximately million 
the company cannot estimate at this time the effect of future reductions  if any  in inventory levels on its future operating results 
the company currently anticipates that inventory levels will increase in due  in part  to commencement of production at the company s third manufacturing facility in olive branch  mississippi 
property  plant and equipment 
at december   the company s construction in process totaled approximately million 
the construction in process consisted primarily of funds expended to construct a facility and install production lines at the manufacturing site in olive branch  mississippi  to complete production lines in various stages of construction at the winchester and fernley manufacturing sites  and to construct plastic reprocessing equipment 
the company currently expects that the olive branch facility and the production lines in process will be completed and put into service by mid pursuant to financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable  the company compares the carrying values of its long lived assets  including construction in process  against the expected undiscounted cash flows relating to those assets 
the significant assumptions inherent in the company s estimate include increases in sales volumes and maintenance of gross margins that are consistent with historical levels 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in such event  the carrying value and the estimated useful lives of the company s long lived assets could be reduced in the future 
property  plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the depreciable lives of these assets range from to years 
we make estimates of the useful lives  in part  based upon historical performance of similar assets 
we periodically review the remaining estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment to determine if any revisions to our estimates are necessary 
changes to our estimate of the useful lives of our property  plant and equipment could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents contingencies 
the company is subject  from time to time  to various lawsuits and other claims related to patent infringement  product liability and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
the company makes a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies after an analysis of each lawsuit and claim 
the required reserves may change in the future as a result of new developments in any such matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with a particular matter 
in the opinion of management  adequate provision has been made for any probable losses as of december  revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when title is transferred to customers  which is generally upon shipment of the product to the customer from the company s manufacturing facilities 
pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  the company records all shipping and handling fees in net sales and records all of the related costs in cost of sales 
the company offers several programs to dealers and distributors  including cash rebates  sales incentives and cooperative advertising 
the company accounts for these programs as either reductions to sales or as selling  general and administrative expenses in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products

the company funded its aggregate capital expenditures of million for the three year period ended december  from a combination of cash flow from operations and proceeds from financing activities  including borrowings under various loan and revolving credit facilities 
the company currently expects that it will fund its future capital expenditures primarily with cash from operations and with borrowings under its revolving credit facility and or other bank financing arrangements 
as of the date of this report  the company had no commitment for any such other financing arrangements 
the company also may determine that it is necessary or desirable to obtain financing for such requirements through the issuance of debt or equity securities

for additional information about the company s management of its interest rate risk  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt 
the fair value of the company s long term fixed rate debt on december  was approximately million 
based on balances outstanding at december   a change in interest rates would change the fair value of the company s long term fixed rate debt by million 
the foregoing sensitivity analysis provides only a limited view as of a specific date regarding the sensitivity of some of the company s financial instruments to market risk 
the actual impact of changes in market interest rates on the financial instruments may differ significantly from the impact shown in this sensitivity analysis 
the company has a purchase agreement for pe material under which it has certain limited market risk related to foreign currency fluctuations on euros 
at current purchase levels  such exposure is not material
