management closely monitors operating earnings and operating margin of each business segment to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability 
management s discussion and analysis the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview the company believes it is one of the leading designers  manufacturers and marketers of engineered stationary air compressors  liquid ring pumps and blowers for various industrial and transportation applications and of pumps used in the petroleum and industrial markets and other fluid transfer equipment serving chemical  petroleum and food industries 
since its spin off from cooper industries  inc in  the company has completed acquisitions  growing its revenues from approximately million to million in of the acquisitions  the two largest were completed in with the purchase of nash elmo holdings  llc nash elmo and syltone plc syltone 
on september   the company acquired nash elmo  a leading global manufacturer of industrial vacuum pumps 
nash elmo is primarily split between two businesses  liquid ring pumps and side channel blowers 
both businesses products are complementary to the compressor and vacuum products segment s existing product portfolio 
nash elmo  previously headquartered in trumbull  ct  has primary manufacturing facilities located in bad neustadt and nuremberg  germany  zibo  china  and campinas  brazil 
for the year ended december   nash elmo s revenues and earnings before income taxes were million and million  respectively 
nash elmo s largest markets are in europe  asia  north america and south america 
approximately of nash elmo s revenues are generated from liquid ring pump products including related engineered systems and aftermarket services  while the remaining are derived from side channel blower products including aftermarket services 
on january   the company acquired the outstanding shares of syltone  previously a publicly traded company listed on the london stock exchange 
syltone  previously headquartered in bradford  united kingdom uk  is one of the world s largest manufacturers of equipment used for loading and unloading liquid and dry bulk products on commercial transportation vehicles 
this equipment includes compressors  blowers and other ancillary products that are complementary to the company s existing product lines 
syltone is also one of the world s largest manufacturers of fluid transfer equipment including loading arms  swivel joints  couplers and valves used to load and unload ships  tank trucks and rail cars 
for the twelve months ended september   syltone generated revenues and operating profit in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the uk of pound million and pound million  respectively approximately million and million  respectively as calculated using the december  exchange rate of pound 
syltone s largest markets are europe and north america  which represent approximately and of its revenues  respectively 
approximately of syltone s revenues are generated through transportation related activities while the remaining are derived from fluid transfer related activities 
subsequent to the acquisition of nash elmo and syltone  the company continues to be organized based upon the products and services it offers and has four operating divisions compressor  blower  liquid ring pump and fluid transfer 
these divisions comprise two reportable segments  compressor and vacuum products formerly compressed air products and fluid transfer products 
the compressor  blower which now includes the syltone transportation related activities and nash elmo s side channel blower business and liquid ring pump consisting of nash elmo s liquid ring pump business divisions are aggregated into one reportable segment compressor and vacuum products since the long term financial performance of these businesses are affected by similar economic conditions  coupled with the similar nature of their products  manufacturing processes and other business characteristics 
during the third quarter of  the company s former pump and fluid transfer which consisted of the syltone fluid transfer related activities divisions were combined into one division  fluid transfer 
these two divisions were previously aggregated into one reportable segment fluid transfer products primarily due to the same factors as noted above  and thus  there has been no change to the fluid transfer products segment 
in the compressor and vacuum products segment  the company designs  manufactures  markets and services the following products and related aftermarket parts for industrial and commercial applications rotary screw  reciprocating  sliding vane and centrifugal compressors  positive displacement  centrifugal and side channel blowers  and liquid ring pumps and engineered systems 
stationary air compressors are used in manufacturing  process applications and materials handling  and to power air tools and equipment 
blowers are used primarily in pneumatic conveying  wastewater aeration  numerous applications in industrial manufacturing and engineered vacuum systems 
liquid ring pumps are used in many different vacuum applications and engineered systems  such as water removal  distilling  reacting  efficiency improvement  lifting and handling  and filtering  principally in the pulp and paper  industrial manufacturing  chemical and power industries 
revenues of the compressor and vacuum products segment constituted of total revenues in in the fluid transfer products segment  the company designs  manufactures  markets and services a diverse group of pumps  water jetting systems and related aftermarket parts used in oil and natural gas production  well servicing and drilling and industrial cleaning and maintenance 
this segment also designs  manufactures  markets and services other fluid transfer components and equipment for the chemical  petroleum and food industries 
revenues of the fluid transfer products segment constituted of total revenues in the company sells its products through independent distributors and sales representatives  and directly to original equipment manufacturers  engineering firms  packagers and end users 
the following table sets forth percentage relationships to revenues of certain income statement items for the years presented 
revenues costs and expenses cost of sales depreciation and amortization selling and administrative expenses interest expense other income  net total costs and expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income recent developments on march   the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire thomas industries inc thomas  a new york stock exchange listed company trading under the ticker symbol tii

these products are also distributed worldwide 
the manufacturing facility in china was constructed during late and will begin production in mid thomas largest markets are europe and the united states  which represent approximately and of its revenues  respectively 
of the total european sales  approximately are within germany and are within other european countries 
approximately of thomas revenues are generated in asia pacific 
at december   thomas employed approximately  people 
for the year ended december   thomas revenues and operating income were million and million  respectively 
operating income for this period included million from thomas interest in the genlyte thomas group llc gtg  a joint venture formed with the genlyte group incorporated genlyte in  and a million nonrecurring gain on the sale of this joint venture in july for the twelve month period of  operating income from thomas pumps and compressors segment  net of corporate expenses  was million 
gardner denver has received a debt commitment to fully finance the acquisition of thomas 
however  gardner denver intends to finance the acquisition through an amended and expanded senior secured bank facility and a public offering of approximately million of its common stock 
in addition  the company may choose to access the debt capital markets 
the acquisition is not conditioned upon completion of any of these financings and the size and timing of the equity and any debt financings are subject to prevailing market conditions 
the acquisition is expected to close in and is subject to the approval of thomas stockholders and other customary closing conditions  including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals 
year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenues revenues increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to acquisitions in  which contributed million in revenues 
increased shipments of well stimulation pumps  pump parts  compressors and blowers  combined with changes in currency exchange rates and price increases  also contributed to this increase 
revenues outside the united states  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in  compared to in  primarily due to acquisitions and volume increases in europe  china and south africa 
revenues for the compressor and vacuum products segment increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase is primarily due to acquisitions in  increased volume of compressor and blower shipments in the us  europe  china and south africa  changes in currency exchange rates and price increases 
fluid transfer products segment revenues increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of syltone  increased shipments of well stimulation pumps  water jetting systems and related aftermarket and price increases 
these positive factors were partially offset by a decreased volume of drilling pump shipments 
costs and expenses gross margin increased million to million in  compared to million in gross margin percentage increased to in  compared to in this increase in gross margin percentage was principally attributable to the increased volume in both segments and the related positive impact of increased leverage of fixed and semi fixed costs over a higher revenue base 
acquisitions completed in also positively impacted gross margin percentage  as their gross margin percentage was higher than the company s previously existing businesses despite a non recurring negative impact of approximately million stemming from recording their inventory at fair value on the respective acquisition dates 
finally  favorable sales mix also contributed to the increased gross margin as included a higher percentage of aftermarket sales compared to the prior year 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher material costs due to surcharges on castings and other components stemming from increases in scrap iron and other metal prices 
higher warranty costs and some supply chain inefficiencies that affected material availability also negatively impacted gross margin 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to the syltone and nash elmo acquisitions 
selling and administrative expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to acquisitions in million 
higher compensation and fringe benefit costs  professional fees and changes in currency exchange rates also contributed to this increase 
as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses increased to for from in the prior year  primarily due to the acquisitions 
other income  net decreased million in to million  compared to million in this change was primarily due to higher foreign currency transaction gains recorded in prior year results included a million gain in the fourth quarter related to the appreciation of us dollar borrowings  which were converted to british pounds prior to being used to consummate the syltone acquisition 
an additional million gain was recorded related to these borrowings in the first quarter of prior year results also included a million pretax gain on the sale of an idle manufacturing facility in syracuse  new york 
the compressor and vacuum products segment generated operating earnings as a percentage of revenues of in  compared to in this increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact of increased leverage of the segment s fixed and semi fixed costs over a higher revenue base  favorable sales mix and restructuring programs initiated in the fourth quarter of these positive factors were partially offset by higher material  compensation and fringe benefit and warranty costs 
operating earnings as a percentage of revenues from compressor and vacuum products segment businesses that existed prior to the nash elmo and syltone acquisitions were for the fluid transfer products segment generated operating earnings as a percentage of revenues of in  compared to in this improvement was primarily attributable to the positive impact of increased leverage of the segment s fixed and semi fixed costs over a higher revenue base  operational improvements and price increases 
these positive factors were partially offset by the impact of the syltone business included in this segment which had lower operating earnings as a percentage of revenues than the segment s previously existing businesses 
operating earnings as a percentage of revenues from fluid transfer products segment businesses that existed prior to the syltone acquisition were in interest expense increased million to million in  compared to million in  due to higher average borrowings stemming from the syltone and nash elmo acquisitions and higher average interest rates 
the average interest rate was in  compared to in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s borrowing arrangements 
income before income taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in acquisitions in contributed million to this increase 
the balance of the increase is primarily due to the increased volume in both segments and the related positive impact of increased leverage of fixed and semi fixed costs over a higher revenue base 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher material  compensation and fringe benefit and warranty costs 
the provision for income taxes increased by million to million in  compared to million in  as a result of the incremental income before taxes partially offset by a lower overall effective tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate was lowered to in compared to in the lower rate is principally due to favorable tax audit settlements in finland and the us of million and million  respectively 
a higher proportion of earnings derived from lower taxed non us jurisdictions also contributed to the lower effective tax rate 
these positive factors were partially offset by incremental taxes accrued in the amount of million for the planned repatriation of certain non us earnings in at a reduced income tax rate pursuant to the american jobs creation act of net income increased million to million diluted earnings per share in  compared to million diluted earnings per share in the increase in net income is primarily attributable to the same factors that resulted in increased income before taxes and the lower effective tax rate as noted above 
changes in currency exchange rates also contributed favorably by increasing net income by approximately million 
net income included million diluted earnings per share and million diluted earnings per share in after tax lifo income in and  respectively 
the estimated incremental impact on diluted earnings per share from acquisitions was in  which was partially offset by a dilutive impact from a stock offering completed in the first quarter of year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenues revenues increased million to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to changes in currency exchange rates 
revenues outside the united states  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in  compared to in this increase is due to changes in currency exchange rates primarily the euro and british pound and volume increases in asia and canada 
revenues for the compressor and vacuum products segment increased million to million in  compared to million in revenues in this segment increased approximately million due to changes in currency exchange rates 
increased prices contributed approximately million but were partially offset by lower centrifugal blower volume 
revenues in the fluid transfer products segment increased million to million in  compared to million in volume increases contributed approximately percentage points of the change  primarily due to increased shipments of well stimulation pumps and petroleum pump parts which was partially offset by lower drilling pump shipments 
increased prices contributed the remaining percentage point increase 
in  fluid transfer products segment revenues were supported by drilling pump backlog carried over from orders 
costs and expenses during the fourth quarter of  the company announced and initiated restructuring plans to eliminate redundant manufacturing capacity  streamline operations and reduce costs 
these activities represent further integration of previously completed acquisitions  which the company expects will better leverage existing manufacturing facilities 
as a result of the restructuring  the company expects to realize a net reduction in headcount of approximately personnel approximately of its workforce as of september  by the end of the substantial majority of this headcount reduction was realized during the fourth quarter of as part of the restructuring program  the company refocused the marketing strategies of its german blower business to place more emphasis on the truck blower market rather than industrial applications for its products 
in addition  the company exited the marketing and manufacturing of certain highly engineered compressor packages in the uk and uk the company also announced its plan to implement new manufacturing processes and systems improvements to reduce inventory and its intent to establish a compressor packaging and assembly operation in china 
the aggregate financial impact of these profitability improvement programs restructuring plans  inventory reduction plan and establishment of china operations resulted in a reduction in diluted earnings per share of approximately in the fourth quarter of atchison casting corporation  the company s largest supplier of iron castings in  downsized and subsequently closed its lagrange  missouri foundry lagrange foundry in the second half of as a result  the company implemented its previously developed contingency plan to secure alternate supply sources 
there was a negative impact on the company s financial performance estimated at and diluted earnings per share in and  respectively as additional costs were incurred to expedite delivery of castings from new suppliers and accelerate depreciation expense of pattern modification charges from alternate casting suppliers who are no longer servicing the company 
gross margin increased million in to million  compared to million in gross margin percentage of revenues decreased to in from in this decrease in the gross margin percentage was principally attributable to charges to cost of sales of million incurred in conjunction with implementing the profitability improvement programs discussed above 
this factor contributed percentage points of the percentage point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues 
unfavorable sales mix including a lower proportion of drilling pump and centrifugal blower sales which generate higher gross margins  and a higher proportion of compressor package sales  which generate lower gross margins  and incremental costs associated with the disruption in the company s casting supply chain also contributed to this decrease 
these negative factors were partially offset by cost reduction efforts  including continued acquisition integration 
selling and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in  primarily due to changes in currency exchange rates 
selling and administrative expenses increased due to changes in currency exchange rates and due to expenses associated with the profitability improvement programs 
the remaining increase of was primarily attributable to higher compensation and postretirement expenses  which were partially offset by lower medical costs and other cost reduction efforts  including continued acquisition integration 
as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses were in  compared to in the increase in this ratio was primarily attributable to the factors discussed above  partially offset by the impact of higher revenues 
operating earnings for the compressor and vacuum products segment decreased million to million  compared to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to million of charges incurred in the fourth quarter of for the profitability improvement programs 
higher compensation  postretirement and warranty expenses combined with costs associated with the disruption within the company s casting supply chain also contributed to this decrease 
these negative factors were partially offset by changes in currency exchange rates  lower medical costs and cost reductions efforts  including continued acquisition integration 
as a percentage of revenues  operating earnings decreased to in  compared to in  as a result of the factors noted above 
the expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of related to implementing the profitability improvement programs contributed percentage points of this percentage point decrease in operating earnings as a percentage of revenues 
operating earnings for the fluid transfer products segment decreased million to million in  a decrease from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a less favorable sales mix due to a lower proportion of revenues from drilling pumps  which generate higher margins than other pump products 
higher compensation and postretirement expenses also contributed to this decrease 
as a percentage of revenues  operating earnings for this segment decreased to in  compared to in  as a result of the factors noted above 
interest expense decreased million to million for  compared to million in  due to lower average borrowings and interest rates 
the average interest rate for was compared to in other income  net increased million to million in compared to million in  due to an unrealized currency transaction gain of million recorded in the fourth quarter of this gain related to the appreciation of us dollar borrowings  which were converted to british pounds in november prior to being used to consummate the syltone acquisition in january income before income taxes increased million to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of the unrealized currency transaction gain  lower interest expense and changes in currency exchange rates discussed above 
these positive factors were partially offset by the lower operating earnings in each segment 
the provision for income taxes increased by million to million in  compared to million in  as a result of the higher income before taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was in both years 
net income increased million to million diluted earnings per share in  compared to million diluted earnings per share in net income included million diluted earnings per share and million diluted earnings per share in after tax lifo income in and  respectively 
the increase in net income was primarily attributable to the same factors that resulted in increased income before taxes discussed above 
changes in currency exchange rates also contributed favorably by increasing net income by approximately million in outlook in  orders for compressor and vacuum products were million  compared to million in order backlog for the compressor and vacuum products segment was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the favorable impact from acquisitions for this segment was approximately million and million for orders and backlog  respectively  for the year ended and as of december  excluding this impact  the increase in orders and backlog compared to the prior year was primarily due to improvement in industrial demand in the us and europe combined with incremental market share gains in europe  china and south africa and favorable changes in currency exchange rates 
the company also experienced an increase in demand for positive displacement blowers and locomotive compressors due to an improved transportation market in the us these positive factors were partially offset by the company s exit from the marketing and manufacture of certain highly engineered compressor packages in the uk and uk in fourth quarter of because air is often used as a fourth utility in the manufacturing process  demand for compressor and vacuum products is generally correlated to manufacturing capacity utilization rates and the rate of change of industrial equipment production 
over longer time periods  demand also follows the economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the gross domestic product 
these indicators have been relatively weak in both and but did improve gradually during as a result  orders for compressor and vacuum products are anticipated to improve modestly in as the us and european industrial economies continue to recover 
demand for fluid transfer products  which are primarily petroleum related  has historically corresponded to market conditions and expectations for oil and natural gas prices 
orders for fluid transfer products were million in  an increase of million compared to million in order backlog for the fluid transfer products segment was million at december   compared to million as of december   representing a increase 
the increase in orders and backlog for this segment due to acquisitions is million and million  respectively 
increased demand for well stimulation pumps  drilling pumps and petroleum pump parts also contributed to the increase as a result of elevated prices for oil and natural gas 
future increases in demand for these products will likely be dependent upon rig counts and oil and natural gas prices  which the company cannot predict 
liquidity and capital resources operating working capital during  operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventories  less accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million to million compared to million in the prior year primarily due to the acquisitions 
inventory turnover decreased to at december   compared to at december  days sales outstanding improved to days at december   compared to days at december   due to increased use of progress billings and improved collections 
cash flows during  the company generated cash flows from operations totaling million  an increase of million compared to this increase was primarily the result of acquisitions million and higher net income from previously existing businesses 
net of cash acquired  million was used to fund the nash elmo and syltone acquisitions including direct acquisition costs in this use of cash was primarily funded by net borrowings of million  the common stock offering in march that generated million and excess cash reserves 
the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was million in compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to a significant strengthening of the british pound against the us dollar during combined with the fact that the company had significant british pound denominated cash and cash equivalents on hand during the fourth quarter of to fund the syltone acquisition in january the cash flows provided by operating and financing activities and used in investing activities  combined with the effect of exchange rate changes  resulted in a net cash decrease of million during capital expenditures and commitments capital projects designed to increase operating efficiency and flexibility  expand production capacity and increase product quality resulted in expenditures of million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to acquisitions  the completion of a new assembly and packaging facility in china and the integration of certain businesses onto the company s common enterprise resource planning system 
commitments for capital expenditures at december  are approximately million 
capital expenditures related to environmental projects have not been significant in the past and are not expected to be significant in the foreseeable future 
in october  gardner denver s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock to be used for general corporate purposes 
approximately  shares remain available for repurchase under this program 
the company has also established a stock repurchase program for its executive officers to provide a means for them to sell gardner denver common stock and obtain sufficient funds to meet income tax obligations which arise from the exercise or vesting of incentive stock options  restricted stock or performance shares 
the gardner denver board has authorized up to  shares for repurchase under this program  and of this amount  approximately  shares remain available for repurchase 
during  no shares were repurchased under these repurchase programs 
as of december   a total of  shares have been repurchased at a cost of million under both repurchase programs 
in  the company also acquired  shares of its common stock  valued at million  which were tendered for the exercise of stock options 
liquidity on march   the company amended and restated its then existing revolving line of credit agreement the credit agreement  increasing the aggregate borrowing capacity to million and extending the maturity date to march  on september   the company amended and restated the credit agreement once again  increasing the borrowing capacity to million 
this latter amended and restated credit agreement provided the company with access to senior secured credit facilities including a million five year term loan and a million five year revolving line of credit the credit line 
proceeds from the credit agreement were used to fund the nash elmo acquisition and retire debt outstanding under its previously existing credit line and term loan 
the credit line matures on september  on december   the credit line had an outstanding principal balance of million  leaving million available for letters of credit or future use  subject to the terms of the credit line 
the million term loan has a final maturity of september  the term loan requires principal payments totaling million  million  million  million and million in years one through five  respectively 
other terms and conditions of the term loan are similar to those of the credit line 
the company s borrowing arrangements permit certain investments and dividend payments and are generally unsecured with the exception of the credit agreement  which requires the pledge of the stock of certain wholly owned subsidiaries  and a security interest in the company s manufacturing facility in bad neustadt  germany 
there are no material restrictions on the company as a result of its credit arrangements  other than customary covenants regarding certain earnings  liquidity and capital ratios 
on september   the company filed with the securities and exchange commission sec a shelf registration statement regarding million of its securities 
in march  the company sold million shares of common stock lowering the amount of securities available on the shelf to million 
on january   the company filed a second shelf registration statement regarding million of its securities  bringing the total securities currently available to million 
the registration statement has since been declared effective by the sec and allows the company to complete one or more offerings of its common stock  preferred stock  debt securities or warrants 
the company intends to use the net proceeds from any offerings for acquisitions  capital expenditures  repayment of borrowings  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
as discussed under the recent development section above  on march   the company executed an agreement and plan of merger merger agreement through which it expects to effectively acquire all the outstanding shares of thomas 
the company s acquisition of thomas through the merger agreement is not contingent on the company s ability to finance the transaction 
simultaneously with the execution of the merger agreement  the company executed a commitment letter with bear stearns co  inc and jp morgan chase bank  na and affiliated parties together  the commitment parties 
this commitment letter obligates the commitment parties  subject to limited conditions  to provide senior secured credit facilities to the company in the aggregate amount of million if the company s acquisition of thomas is consummated 
these credit facilities could be used by the company to finance the acquisition of thomas  pay related fees and expenses  refinance the existing indebtedness of the company  and finance the company s continuing operations after the acquisition of thomas 
although these credit facilities are available to the company through the commitment letter  the company currently plans to finance the thomas acquisition through the amendment and expansion of its existing credit agreement  and the issuance of approximately million of its common stock 
in addition  the company may choose to access the debt capital markets 
the size and timing of the common stock offering and any debt financings are subject to prevailing market conditions 
management currently expects the company s cash flows in to be sufficient to fund its scheduled debt service and provide required resources for working capital and capital investments 
contractual obligations at december   certain of the company s contractual obligations  including estimated payments due by period  are as follows dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years debt      operating leases      purchase obligations   total      purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements 
the above table excludes million of other non current liabilities recorded in the balance sheet  which primarily consist of pension and other postretirement liabilities and deferred income taxes  because the timing of payments related to such liabilities is uncertain 
the table also excludes interest payments on existing debt arrangements

contingencies the company is a party to various legal proceedings  lawsuits and administrative actions  which are of an ordinary or routine nature 
in addition  due to the bankruptcies of several asbestos manufacturers and other primary defendants  the company has been named as a defendant in an increasing number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
the company has also been named as a defendant in an increasing number of silicosis personal injury lawsuits 
the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically the company is one of approximately or more named defendants 
in the company s experience  the vast majority of the plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease for which the company bears any responsibility 
predecessors to the company manufactured  distributed and sold products allegedly at issue in the pending asbestos and silicosis litigation lawsuits the products 
the company has potential responsibility for certain of these products  namely a air compressors which used asbestos containing components manufactured and supplied by third parties  and b portable air compressors used in sandblasting operations as a component of sandblasting equipment manufactured and sold by others 
the sandblasting equipment is alleged to have caused the silicosis disease plaintiffs claim in these cases 
neither the company nor its predecessors ever mined  manufactured  mixed  produced or distributed asbestos fiber 
the asbestos containing components used in the products were completely encapsulated in a protective non asbestos binder and enclosed within the subject products 
furthermore  the company has never manufactured or distributed portable air compressors 
the company has entered into a series of cost sharing agreements with multiple insurance companies to secure coverage for asbestos and silicosis lawsuits 
the company also believes some of the potential liabilities regarding these lawsuits are covered by indemnity agreements with other parties 
the company s uninsured settlement payments for past asbestos and silicosis lawsuits have been immaterial 
the company believes that the pending and future asbestos and silicosis lawsuits will not  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  based on the company s anticipated insurance and indemnification rights to address the risks of such matters  the limited potential asbestos exposure from the components described above  the company s experience that the vast majority of plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease attributable to alleged exposure to asbestos or silica from or relating to the products  various potential defenses available to the company with respect to such matters  and the company s prior disposition of comparable matters 
however  due to inherent uncertainties of litigation and because future developments could cause a different outcome  there can be no assurance that the resolution of pending or future lawsuits  whether by judgment  settlement or dismissal  will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company has also been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for environmental cleanup under various state and federal laws 
the company does not own any of these sites 
the company does not believe that the future potential costs related to these sites will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity

critical accounting policies management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements and related notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
certain of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
management believes that the amounts recorded in the company s financial statements related to these areas are based on their best judgments and estimates  although actual results could differ materially under different assumptions or conditions 
inventories inventories  which consist of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
as of december   million of the company s inventory is accounted for on a first in  first out fifo basis with the remaining million accounted for on a last in  first out lifo basis 
management regularly reviews inventory for obsolescence to determine whether a write down is necessary 
various factors are considered in making this determination  including recent sales history and predicted trends  industry market conditions and general economic conditions 
goodwill and other intangibles the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations 
among other things  this standard requires that intangible assets acquired in a business combination be recognized at fair value apart from goodwill if they meet one of two criteria the contractual legal criterion or the separability criterion 
the company has also adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of this standard  intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization 
all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
this testing requires comparison of carrying values to fair values  and when appropriate  the carrying value of impaired assets is reduced to fair value 
during the second quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment test and determined that no impairment existed 
while management believes that its estimates of fair value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such factors as product volumes  selling price changes  labor and material cost changes  productivity  interest rates and foreign exchange rates could affect such valuations 
pension and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and expense or income are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rate  rate of compensation increases  expected rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare trend rates 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future expense or income 
in addition  due to the significant declines in the financial markets in recent years  the fair value of the plan assets of certain of the company s funded defined benefit pension plans was less than their accumulated benefit obligation at december  as a result  the company has recorded a cumulative reduction to stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income in the amount of million after tax as of december  this non cash reduction in stockholders equity did not impact the company s compliance with its existing debt covenants and could be reversed in future periods if a combination of factors  including interest rate increases  improved investment results and contributions  cause the pension plans to return to or exceed fully funded status 
however  depending upon the performance of the equity and bond markets in and beyond  the company could also be required to record additional charges to stockholders equity in the future
