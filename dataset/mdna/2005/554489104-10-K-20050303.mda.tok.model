item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of mack cali realty corporation and the notes thereto collectively  the financial statements 
certain defined terms used herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the financial statements 
executive overview mack cali realty corporation the company is one of the largest real estate investment trusts reits in the united states  with a total market capitalization of approximately billion at december  the company has been involved in all aspects of commercial real estate development  management and ownership for over years and has been a publicly traded reit since the company owns or has interests in properties collectively  the properties  primarily class a office and office flex buildings  totaling approximately million square feet  leased to approximately  tenants 
the properties are located primarily in suburban markets of the northeast  some with adjacent  company controlled developable land sites able to accommodate up to million square feet of additional commercial space 
the company s strategy is to be a significant real estate owner and operator in its core  high barriers to entry markets  primarily in the northeast 
as an owner of real estate  almost all of the company s earnings and cash flow is derived from rental revenue received pursuant to leased office space at the properties 
key factors that affect the company s business and financial results include the following the general economic climate  the occupancy rates of the properties  rental rates on new or renewed leases  tenant improvement and leasing costs incurred to obtain and retain tenants  the extent of early lease terminations  operating expenses  cost of capital  and the extent of acquisitions  development and sales of real estate 
any negative effects of the above key factors could potentially cause a deterioration in the company s revenue and or earnings 
such negative effects could include failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire  failure to renew or execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of in place leases  and tenant defaults 
a failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire or to execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of in place leases may be affected by several factors such as the local economic climate  which may be adversely impacted by business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  changing demographics and other factors  and local real estate conditions  such as oversupply of office and office flex space or competition within the market 
as a result of the economic climate since  substantially all of the real estate markets the company operates in materially softened 
demand for office space declined significantly and vacancy rates increased in each of the company s core markets over the period 
through february   the company s core markets continued to be weak 
the percentage leased in the company s consolidated portfolio of stabilized operating properties decreased to percent at december  as compared to percent at december  and percent at december  percentage leased includes all leases in effect as of the period end date  some of which have commencement dates in the future  and leases that expire at the period end date 
excluded from percentage leased at december  was a non strategic  non core  square foot property acquired through a deed in lieu of foreclosure  which was percent leased at december  and subsequently sold on february  leases that expired as of december   and aggregate   and  square feet  respectively  or  and percentage of the net rentable square footage  respectively 
market rental rates have declined in most markets from peak levels in late and early rental rates on the company s space that was re leased based on first rents payable during the year ended december  decreased an average of percent compared to rates that were in effect under expiring leases  as compared to a percent decrease in and a percent increase in the company believes that vacancy rates may continue to increase in most of its markets in as a result  the company s future earnings and cash flow may continue to be negatively impacted by current market conditions 
the remaining portion of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should help the reader understand property transactions during the period  critical accounting policies and estimates  results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the same period last year  results of operations for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   and liquidity and capital resources

critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s historical experience that are believed to be reasonable at the time 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
the company s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain 
different estimates could have a material effect on the company s financial results 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances 
rental property rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
costs directly related to the acquisition  development and construction of rental properties are capitalized 
capitalized development and construction costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development and construction costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  salaries and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
interest capitalized by the company for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred  major replacements and betterments  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
fully depreciated assets are removed from the accounts 
the company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity as distinguished from activities such as routine maintenance and cleanup 
if portions of a rental project are substantially completed and occupied by tenants  or held available for occupancy  and other portions have not yet reached that stage  the substantially completed portions are accounted for as a separate project 
the company allocates costs incurred between the portions under construction and the portions substantially completed and held available for occupancy and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows leasehold interests remaining lease term buildings and improvements to years tenant improvements the shorter of the term of the related lease or useful life furniture  fixtures and equipment to years upon acquisition of rental property  the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities generally consisting of the fair value of i above and below market leases  ii in place leases and iii tenant relationships 
the company allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired  the company considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities  and utilizes various valuation methods  such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates  estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation  and available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
above market and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases  and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values and tenant relationship values which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the company s overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  management considers leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the company s existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of in place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles will be amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s rental properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
the company s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and costs to operate each property 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions  the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be achieved 
management does not believe that the value of any of the company s rental properties is impaired 
rental property held for sale and discontinued operations when assets are identified by management as held for sale  the company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price  net of selling costs  of such assets 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the assets which have been identified as held for sale is less than the net book value of the assets  a valuation allowance is established 
properties identified as held for sale and or sold are presented in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
if circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and  as a result  the company decides not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale  the property is reclassified as held and used 
a property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of a its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used  or b the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
revenue recognition base rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
unbilled rents receivable represents the amount by which straight line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with the lease agreements 
above market and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases  and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases 
parking and other revenue includes income from parking spaces leased to tenants  income from tenants for additional services provided by the company  income from tenants for early lease terminations and income from managing and or leasing properties for third parties 
escalations and recoveries are received from tenants for certain costs as provided in the lease agreements 
these costs generally include real estate taxes  utilities  insurance  common area maintenance and other recoverable costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts management periodically performs a detailed review of amounts due from tenants to determine if accounts receivable balances are impaired based on factors affecting the collectibility of those balances 
management s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of collection losses  which affects the allowance and net income

liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview historically  rental revenue has been the principal source of funds to pay operating expenses  debt service  capital expenditures and dividends  excluding non recurring capital expenditures 
to the extent that the company s cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to finance its non recurring capital expenditures such as property acquisitions  development and construction costs and other capital expenditures  the company has and expects to continue to finance such activities through borrowings under its revolving credit facility and other debt and equity financings 
the company believes that with the general downturn in the economy in recent years  and the softening of the company s markets specifically  it is reasonably likely that vacancy rates may continue to increase  effective rental rates on new and renewed leases may continue to decrease and tenant installation costs  including concessions  may continue to increase in most or all of its markets in as a result of the potential negative effects on the company s revenue from the overall reduced demand for office space  the company s cash flow could be insufficient to cover increased tenant installation costs over the short term 
if this situation were to occur  the company expects that it would finance any shortfalls through borrowings under its revolving credit facility and other debt and equity financings 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through its working capital  net cash provided by operating activities and from its revolving credit facility 
the company frequently examines potential property acquisitions and development projects and  at any given time  one or more of such acquisitions or development projects may be under consideration 
accordingly  the ability to fund property acquisitions and development projects is a major part of the company s financing requirements 
the company expects to meet its financing requirements through funds generated from operating activities  proceeds from property sales  long term and short term borrowings including draws on the company s revolving credit facility and the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
reit restrictions to maintain its qualification as a reit  the company must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least percent of its reit taxable income  determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 
moreover  the company intends to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to its common stockholders which  based upon current policy  in the aggregate would equal approximately million on an annualized basis 
however  any such distribution  whether for federal income tax purposes or otherwise  would only be paid out of available cash  including borrowings and other sources  after meeting operating requirements  preferred stock and unit dividends and distributions  and scheduled debt service on the company s debt 
property lock ups the company may not dispose of or distribute certain of its properties  currently comprising properties with an aggregate net book value of approximately billion  which were originally contributed by members of either the mack group which includes william l

the aforementioned restrictions do not apply in the event that the company sells all of its properties or in connection with a sale transaction which the company s board of directors determines is reasonably necessary to satisfy a material monetary default on any unsecured debt  judgment or liability of the company or to cure any material monetary default on any mortgage secured by a property 
the property lock ups expire periodically through upon the expiration of the property lock ups  the company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any sale  transfer or other disposition of the subject properties from resulting in the recognition of built in gain to the appropriate mack group  robert martin group or cali group members
