item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  the bank was considered well capitalized as of december  prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions  including but not limited to those institutions that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios described above 
an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratio actually warrants such treatment 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation  or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a depository institution  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted 
additionally  a holding company s inability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banking organizations could serve as an additional basis for a regulatory action against the holding company 
banks are also subject to certain federal reserve board restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons ie  insiders 
extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms and pursuant to the same credit underwriting procedures as those for comparable transactions with persons who are neither insiders nor employees  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to insiders 
a violation of these restrictions may result in regulatory sanctions on the bank or its insiders 
premiums for deposit insurance the bank s deposits are currently insured to a maximum of  per depositor through the bank insurance fund administered by the fdic 
the bank is required to pay deposit insurance premiums  which are assessed semiannually and paid quarterly 
the premium amount is based upon a risk classification system established by the fdic 
banks with higher levels of capital and a low degree of supervisory concern are assessed lower premiums than banks with lower levels of capital or a higher degree of supervisory concern 
the fdic is also empowered to make special assessments on insured depository institutions in amounts determined by the fdic to be necessary to give it adequate assessment income to repay amounts borrowed from the us treasury and other sources or for any other purpose the fdic deems necessary 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
sarbanes oxley act of on july   the sarbanes oxley act of sox  was signed into law to address corporate and accounting fraud 
sox establishes a new accounting oversight board that will enforce auditing standards and restricts the scope of services that accounting firms may provide to their public company audit clients 
among other things  sox also i requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers to certify to the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the sec  ii imposes new disclosure requirements regarding internal controls  off balance sheet transactions  and pro forma non gaap disclosures  iii accelerates the time frame for reporting of insider transactions and periodic disclosures by public companies  and iv requires companies to disclose whether or not they have adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers and whether the audit committee includes at least one audit committee financial expert 
under sox  the sec is required to regularly and systematically review corporate filings  based on certain enumerated factors 
to deter wrongdoing  sox i subjects bonuses issued to top executives to disgorgement if a restatement of a company s financial statements was due to corporate misconduct  ii prohibits an officer or director from misleading or coercing an auditor  iii prohibits insider trades during pension fund blackout periods  iv imposes new criminal penalties for fraud and other wrongful acts  and v extends the period during which certain securities fraud lawsuits can be brought against a company or its officers 
as a public reporting company  the company is subject to the requirements of sox and related rules and regulations issued by the sec and nasdaq 
the company has incurred additional expense as a result of the requirements of the act  but does not expect that such compliance will have a material impact on its business overall 
financial services modernization legislation on november   the gramm leach bliley act of the financial services modernization act was signed into law 
the financial services modernization act is intended to modernize the banking industry by removing barriers to affiliation among banks  insurance companies  the securities industry and other financial service providers 
it provides financial organizations with the flexibility of structuring such affiliations through a holding company structure or through a financial subsidiary of a bank  subject to certain limitations 
the financial services modernization act establishes a new type of bank holding company  known as a financial holding company  which may engage in an expanded list of activities that are financial in nature  which include securities and insurance brokerage  securities underwriting  insurance underwriting and merchant banking 
the company has not chosen to seek financial holding company status 
the financial services modernization act also sets forth a system of functional regulation that makes the federal reserve board the umbrella supervisor for holding companies  while providing for the supervision of the holding company s subsidiaries by other federal and state agencies 
in addition  the bank is subject to other provisions of the financial services modernization act  including those relating to cra  privacy and safe guarding confidential customer information  regardless of whether the company elects to become a financial holding company or to conduct activities through a financial subsidiary of the bank 
the company does not  however  currently intend to file notice with the federal reserve board to become a financial holding company or to engage in expanded financial activities through a financial subsidiary of the bank 
the company and the bank do not believe that the financial services modernization act will have a material adverse effect on their operations in the near term 
however  to the extent that it permits banks  securities firms  and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the financial services modernization act is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis 
nevertheless  this act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that the company and the bank face from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources than the company and the bank 
usa patriot act of on october   president bush signed the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism  or the patriot act  of among other things  the patriot act i prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks  ii imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals iii requires financial institutions to establish an anti money laundering compliance program  and iv eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports 
the patriot act also increases governmental powers to investigate terrorism  including expanded government access to account records 
the department of the treasury is empowered to administer and make rules to implement the patriot act 
while the company and the bank believes the patriot act may  to some degree  affect their recordkeeping and reporting expenses  they do not believe that it will have a material adverse effect on their business and operations 
transactions between affiliates transactions between a bank and its affiliates are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under the federal reserve act 
the federal reserve board issued regulation w on october   which comprehensively implements sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
sections a and b and regulation w restrict loans by a depository institution to its affiliates  asset purchases by a depository institution from its affiliates  and other transactions between a depository institution and its affiliates 
regulation w unifies in one public document the federal reserve board s interpretations of section a and b 
regulation w had an effective date of april  community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving home mortgage lending operations and cra activities 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
in addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be required for a violation of certain fair lending laws  the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and cra into account when regulating and supervising other activities 
when a bank holding company applies for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  the federal reserve will review the assessment of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company  and such records may be the basis for denying the application 
a bank s compliance with its cra obligations is based on a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on an institution s lending service and investment performance  resulting in a rating by the appropriate bank regulatory agency of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
at its last examination by the fdic  the bank received a cra rating of satisfactory 
safety and soundness standards the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia imposes certain specific restrictions on transactions and requires federal banking regulators to adopt overall safety and soundness standards for depository institutions related to internal control  loan underwriting and documentation and asset growth 
among other things  fdicia limits the interest rates paid on deposits by undercapitalized institutions  restricts the use of brokered deposits  limits the aggregate extensions of credit by a depository institution to an executive officer  director  principal shareholder or related interest  and reduces deposit insurance coverage for deposits offered by undercapitalized institutions for deposits by certain employee benefits accounts 
the federal banking agencies may require an institution to submit to an acceptable compliance plan as well as have the flexibility to pursue other more appropriate or effective courses of action given the specific circumstances and severity of an institution s noncompliance with one or more standards 
privacy federal banking rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to non affiliated third parties 
pursuant to these rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose non public information to non affiliated third parties and affiliates  annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers  and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to non affiliated third parties 
these privacy provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
we have implemented our privacy policies in accordance with the law 
in recent years  a number of states have implemented their own versions of privacy laws 
for example  in  california adopted standards that are more restrictive than federal law  allowing bank customers the opportunity to bar financial companies from sharing information with their affiliates 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of san francisco 
among other benefits  each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
each fhlb is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
each fhlb makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual fhlb 
a new capital plan of the fhlb of san francisco was approved by the federal housing finance board and was implemented on april  the new capital plan incorporates a single class of stock with a par value of share  and may be issued  exchanged  redeemed  and repurchased only at par value 
each member must own stock in an amount equal to the greater of a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of million of membership asset value as defined  or an activity based stock requirement based on percentage of outstanding advances 
the new capital stock is redeemable with five years written notice  subject to certain conditions 
the effect of this plan was that the bank had to purchase million of additional fhlb stock 
predatory lending the term predatory lending  much like the terms safety and soundness and unfair and deceptive practices  is far reaching and covers a potentially broad range of behavior 
as such  it does not lend itself to a concise or a comprehensive definition 
but typically predatory lending involves at least one  and perhaps all three  of the following elements making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower s ability to repay an obligation  or asset based lending  inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced  or loan flipping  and engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower 
federal reserve board regulations aimed at curbing such lending significantly widened the pool of high cost home secured loans covered by the home ownership and equity protection act of  a federal law that requires extra disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers 
the following triggers coverage under the home ownership and equity protection act of interest rates for first lien mortgage loans in excess of percentage points above comparable treasury securities  subordinate lien loans of percentage points above treasury securities  and fees such as optional insurance and similar debt protection costs paid in connection with the credit transaction  when combined with points and fees if deemed excessive 
in addition  the regulation bars loan flipping by the same lender or loan servicer within a year 
lenders also will be presumed to have violated the law which says loans shouldn t be made to people unable to repay them unless they document that the borrower has the ability to repay 
lenders that violate the rules face cancellation of loans and penalties equal to the finance charges paid 
the company does not expect these rules and potential state action in this area to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
accounting changes from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb issues pronouncements which govern the accounting treatment for the company s financial statements 
for a description of the recent pronouncements applicable to the company see the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
off balance sheet and other related party transactions as noted in footnote to the financial statements  the company is contingently liable for letter of credit accommodations made to its customers in the ordinary course of business totaling million at december  compared to million one year earlier 
additionally  the company has undisbursed loan commitments  also made in the ordinary course of business  totaling million  which compares to million outstanding one year earlier 
there are no special purpose entity spe trusts  corporations  or other legal entities established by the company which reside off balance sheet 
there are no other off balance sheet items other than the aforementioned items related to letter of credit accommodations and undisbursed loan commitments 
as noted in footnote to the financial statements  the company does make loans to related parties directors and officers in the ordinary course of business at prevailing rates and terms 
these loans totaled million at the end of  compared to the million outstanding one year earlier 
while loans to insiders and related parties are generally prohibited under soa  as a bank  mid state is exempt from this rule 
factors that may affect future results of operations dependence on real estate 
a significant portion of the loan portfolio of the company is dependent on real estate 
at december   real estate served as the principal source of collateral with respect to approximately percent of the company s loan portfolio 
a decline in current economic conditions or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans  the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans and the value of real estate owned by the bank  as well as the company s financial condition and results of operations in general and the market value of the company s common stock 
acts of nature  including earthquakes and floods  which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans  may also negatively impact the company s financial condition 
the impact of the san simeon earthquake in did not have a significant adverse impact on the bank s premises or on the value of the collateral supporting the company s real estate loan portfolio 
management continuously monitors residential real estate reports and markets  and is aware of press articles that have discussed a possible slow down in and or drop in value of residential real estate in the bank s service area 
while long term interest rates remain historically low and the bank s service area is marked by limited supply and strong demand  residential projects financed by the bank are underwritten with a requirement of a percentage of cash equity to the total cost of the project in addition to prudent exposures to current appraised values 
to further mitigate this risk  individual projects financed are analyzed using direct  current and historical project trends with limitations to production unit starts ahead of sales using the projected absorption analysis contained in the appraisal of each project 
the bank believes  based upon past experience  that this process helps mitigate against the production of a supply of units that would exceed the current market demand 
additionally  due to the popularity of our market area to urban retirees and others wanting to enjoy the environment and life style it provides  we have seen and continue to see a migration of wealthier individuals and families absorb the residential housing production with greater cash equities than is typical of other areas throughout the country 
this assumption is supported by the fact that the bank s portfolio of residential mortgages have an average loan to value ratio of less than along with average credit scores substantially exceeding industry standards with low delinquency ratios 
operating strategies 
from time to time  the company develops long term financial performance goals to guide and measure the success of our operating strategies 
the company can make no assurance that we will be successful in achieving these long term goals or that our operating strategies will be successful 
achieving success in these areas is dependent on a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s direct control 
factors that may adversely affect the company s ability to attain its long term financial performance goals include deterioration of asset quality  inability to control non interest expense  including  but not limited to  rising employee and healthcare costs  inability to increase non interest income  ability to increase loan growth  ability to find acquisition targets at valuation levels we find attractive  ability to effectively integrate acquired institutions into the company  regulatory and other impediments associated with making acquisitions  deterioration in general economic conditions  especially in the company s core markets  decreases in the company s net interest margin  increases in competition  adverse regulatory or legislative developments  unexpected increase in costs related to regulatory compliance  and unexpected increase in costs related to acquisitions 
expensing of stock options 
the company expects to adopt a new accounting pronouncement in the third quarter of the new accounting will require the company to recognize additional expense for employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  such as stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share for the years  and are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
management expects that the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement will have a material effect on its consolidated statements of income  comprehensive income and changes in capital accounts 
interest rate changes 
the earnings of the company and the bank are substantially affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the demand for new loans  the credit profile of existing loans  the rates received on loans and securities and the rates the bank must pay on deposits and borrowings 
the difference between the rates the bank receives on loans and securities and the rates it must pay on deposits and borrowings is known as the interest rate spread 
given the bank s current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  the bank s interest rate spread can be expected to increase when market interest rates are rising  and to decline when market interest rates are declining 
the federal reserve board s decrease in rates during  and substantially impacted the bank s interest rate spread  as its spread for declined to taxable equivalent from taxable equivalent in and from taxable equivalent in increases in short term rates by the federal reserve board in the latter half of are having the effect of beginning to reverse this trend with the bank s interest spread rising to taxable equivalent in the fourth quarter of although the bank believes its current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse impact on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
competition may adversely affect the bank s performance 
the financial services business in the bank s market area is highly competitive  and becoming more so due to changes in regulation  technological advances and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers 
mid state faces competition both in attracting deposits and making loans 
mid state competes for loans principally through competitive interest rates and the efficiency and quality of the services provided 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services businesses may reduce market share or cause the prices charged for services to fall 
results may differ in future periods depending on the nature or level of competition 
regulation 
both the company and the bank are subject to government regulation that could limit or restrict their activities  adversely affecting operations 
the financial services industry is heavily regulated 
federal and state regulation is designed to protect the deposits of consumers  not to benefit shareholders 
the regulations impose significant limitations on operations  and may be changed at any time  possibly causing results to vary significantly from past results 
government policy and regulation  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects credit conditions 
in response to several well publicized corporate and auditing scandals  the president signed the sarbanes oxley act into law 
this act calls for increased federal regulation of the accounting profession and imposes new requirements upon boards of directors  audit committees and executive officers of public companies 
these requirements increased the accounting and legal costs to the company 
as a public company whose securities are listed on the nasdaq national market  the company was subject to all of these provisions of the act and implementing regulations as well as additional corporate governance standards which nasdaq adopted 
the company expended significant amounts of internal staff time and thousand in outside hard dollar costs to comply with the various provisions of these requirements in management does not expect the amount of staff time and hard dollar costs to be as significant in future years  however  the effect of the legislation has created a permanent annual increase in the cost structure to the bank of at least to thousand 
borrowers failure to perform 
a significant number of the bank s borrowers and guarantors may fail to perform their obligations as required by the terms of their loans  which could result in larger than expected losses 
this risk increases when the economy is weak  as it has been recently 
the bank has adopted underwriting and credit policies  and loan monitoring procedures  including the establishment and monitoring of allowances for credit losses 
management believes these provisions are reasonable and adequate  and should keep credit losses within expected limits by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying the credit portfolio 
however  these policies and procedures may not be adequate to prevent unexpected losses that could materially and adversely affect the results of operations 
operations risks 
the bank is subject to certain operations risks  including  but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors  customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters 
the bank maintains a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintains insurance coverage for such risks  but should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by the bank s internal controls  uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits  it could have a significant adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
loan demand 
the company is significantly affected by the level of loan demand available to it in its markets 
the inability to make sufficient loans directly affects the interest income it earns 
lower loan demand will generally result in lower interest income realized by the company as it places funds in lower yielding investments 
goodwill 
pursuant to gaap  the company is required to periodically asses its goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets to determine if they are impaired 
disruptions to our business  end market conditions and protracted economic weakness  unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units  divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges to goodwill and other asset impairments 
future impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the period of such charge 
in addition  such charges would reduce our consolidated net worth and our shareholders equity 
geographic concentration 
the company s operations are located almost entirely in the central coast region of california 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our results depend largely upon economic and business conditions in this region 
a deterioration in economic and business conditions in our market area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of our loan portfolio and the demand for our products and services  which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
war on terrorism 
the terrorist attacks of september   the ensuing worldwide war on terrorism and the actions in afghanistan and iraq  may lead to unexpected shifts in cash flows  deposit levels  and general economic activity 
us banking agencies have warned of the possible impact of such events on the capital ratios of banks 
company cash flow 
as a holding company  all of the company s cash flow typically comes from dividends from the bank 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the company without regulatory approval 
small business administration sba lending 
sba lending is a federal government created and administered program 
as such  legislative and regulatory developments can affect the availability and funding of the program 
this dependence on legislative funding and regulatory restrictions from time to time causes limitations and uncertainties with regard to the continued funding of such loans  with a resulting potential adverse financial impact on the company s business 
environmental liabilities 
in the course of our business the bank may foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
it may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third persons for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  the bank may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if the bank ever becomes subject to significant environmental liabilities  its business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

the company s shareholders are entitled to receive dividends when declared by its board of directors  out of funds legally available therefor  subject to the restrictions set forth in the california general corporation law the corporation law 
the corporation law provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if the corporation s retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed distribution 
the corporation law also provides that  in the event that sufficient retained earnings are not available for the proposed distribution  a corporation may  nevertheless  make a distribution to its shareholders if it meets two conditions  which generally stated are as follows i the corporation s assets equal at least times its liabilities  and ii the corporation s current assets equal at least its current liabilities or  if the average of the corporation s earnings before taxes on income and before interest expenses for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of the corporation s interest expenses for such fiscal years  then the corporation s current assets must equal at least times its current liabilities 
the ability of the company to pay a cash dividend depends largely on the bank s ability to pay a cash dividend to the company 
the payment of cash dividends by the bank is subject to restrictions set forth in the california financial code the financial code 
the financial code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its shareholders in excess of the lesser of a the bank s retained earnings  or b the bank s net income for its last three fiscal years  less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority owned subsidiary of the bank to the shareholders of the bank during such period 
however  a bank may  with the approval of the dfi  make a distribution to its shareholders in an amount not exceeding the greater of x its retained earnings  y its net income for its last fiscal year  or z its net income for its current fiscal year 
in the event that the dfi determines that the shareholders equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound  the dfi may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution 
the fdic may also restrict the payment of dividends if such payment would be deemed unsafe or unsound or if after the payment of such dividends  the bank would be included in one of the undercapitalized categories for capital adequacy purposes pursuant to federal law 
see  item prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms 
additionally  while the federal reserve board has no general restriction with respect to the payment of cash dividends by an adequately capitalized bank to its parent holding company  the federal reserve board might  under certain circumstances  place restrictions on the ability of a particular bank to pay dividends based upon peer group averages and the performance and maturity of the particular bank  or object to management fees to be paid by a subsidiary bank to its holding company on the basis that such fees cannot be supported by the value of the services rendered or are not the result of an arm s length transaction 
whether or not dividends will be paid in the future will be determined by the board of directors after consideration of various factors 
the company s profitability and regulatory capital ratios in addition to other financial conditions will be key factors considered by the board of directors in making such determinations regarding the payment of dividends by the company

these are discussed in more detail in the income statement analysis section below 
management believes that the primary challenges and risks to the company in are as follows the degree and speed with which the board of governors of the federal reserve system will continue to raise short term interest rates thereby allowing the company to show improvements in its net interest margin 
the ability of the economy to continue its recovery and enhance the company s ability to grow its loan portfolio either through loan originations or purchases consistent with the company s credit standards 
the ability of the company to generate new revenue to replace some of the non recurring benefits to the income statement in the ability of the company to contain salary and benefits costs which have risen rapidly in recent years 
the ability of the company to fully integrate its relatively new ventura county offices and presence into the company and take advantage of the expanded market opportunities it sees there 
the ability of the company to overcome the charge to expense that will result from a change in accounting for stock options which is scheduled to be implemented in the third quarter of see note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements which follows in item of this report 
the ability of the company to make its internal support functions more efficient by exploring  and then implementing  a plan to consolidate their operations in one location in a cost effective manner 
management believes that some of the significant opportunities it has are as follows the ability the company has to fund additional loans due to its strong liquidity at the present time 
the company s asset and liability  maturity and rate structure are such that its net interest margin should improve in a rising rate environment 
the company s expanded presence in ventura county will allow it to take advantage of the large and growing economic base in that part of our market area 
because the company is well capitalized and its stock price has performed well  it is well positioned to continue to make strategic acquisitions in selected markets as it has in recent years 
the ability of the company to make its internal support functions more efficient by exploring  and then implementing  a plan to consolidate their operations in one location in a cost effective manner 
other events and items of note in the company celebrated the one year anniversary of the successful integration of its merger with the former ojai valley bank on october  core deposits total deposits excluding certificates of deposit at the two locations in ojai and oak view have increased from million at the time of the merger to million at year end total deposits which were million at time of merger were million at december  this shift away from more rate sensitive deposit liabilities to core  relationship oriented deposits is expected to benefit the bank going forward 
it should be noted that some of the principal employees in the former ojai valley bank are involved with the start up of the new ojai community bank  which received regulatory approval july   raised the necessary equity capital and is expected to open in early the impact of the opening of this new community bank on the company is unknown at this time 
the company s stock repurchase program continued in with  shares repurchased  which compares to  and  shares repurchased in and  respectively 
the average price paid for the stock over this three year period was  and  respectively 
as of december   the company had  shares remaining to repurchase on its january authorization approved by the board of directors to re purchase up to  additional shares 
the authorization does not have an expiration date 
also during  the company streamlined its corporate banking and business banking efforts under one umbrella internally known as the commercial banking group 
eight regional commercial banking groups under the direction of senior vice president  steven harding are responsible for the company s commercial  commercial real estate and construction lending 
the new alignment of this group has created efficiencies  cost savings and a more focused sales effort 
external factors impacting the bank economic conditions at the start of  in last year s annual report we noted that  entering  management believes that the economy is entering a sustained recovery which will lead to lower unemployment rates  increases in inflation and eventually  a need to raise interest rates to combat fears of excessive growth and inflationary pressures 
management further believes that increases in interest rates will likely take place in the fourth quarter of and or first quarter of amounting to a roughly basis point increase in short term interest rates 
long term interest rates will rise also  albeit at reduced levels compared to short term rates  reflecting a flatter yield curve 
we note that this forecast proved reasonably accurate 
the federal reserve increased short term rates in the second half of by basis points  unemployment rates nationally have declined from at the start of the year to at the end of november  and inflation has averaged for the first months of the year compared to in the yield curve  as expected  has flattened dramatically with the spread between the three month and ten year treasury declining from basis points at the start of to approximately basis points at the end of the year 
the ten year treasury is actually little changed from its level at the start of the year having closed at at the end of the most comprehensive review of local economic conditions in our market known to management comes from the university of california at santa barbara ucsb economic forecast project 
according to ucsb  gross county product in the tri county area was estimated at billion in  up from the level in the prior year 
adjusted for real dollars  it was up following a growth rate in and in while these rates of growth were down from the double digit increases witnessed in the late s  they have been running better than those exhibited by the state as a whole 
california s real state product was in  in and is estimated to grow at in expectations for are for further improvements with the real state product growing and the real tri county gross product growing 
the difficulties experienced at the state level have certainly had a negative effect on the local tri county area 
it is estimated by ucsb that the public sector has lost some  jobs in the tri county area over the last two years  a decline  at a time when the private sector added some  jobs  a increase 
this drag clearly contributed to the slower growth rate in economic activity experienced locally over the past few years 
this notwithstanding  the tri counties continue to be fortunate in experiencing significantly lower unemployment rates compared to the level experienced nationally 
the san luis obispo metropolitan statistical area msa was estimated by the bureau of labor statistics to have an unemployment rate of at the end of november with the santa barbara msa at and the ventura msa at 
management expects these levels to remain little changed in as their low absolute levels would generally be difficult to improve upon 
median home prices are at historical highs throughout the bank s service area 
the median price of a home as of november totaled thousand in san luis obispo county  up from a year earlier 
in santa barbara county  that figure reached thousand  up from one year earlier 
and in ventura county  the median home price was thousand  up from one year before 
in spite of numerous residential building projects in the bank s trade area and housing affordability indices falling below in most locales  the local real estate market continues strong with a combination of favorable interest rate levels and demand far outpacing supply 
the strong trends in both residential and non residential real estate continue with no signs of abating 
lenders are more prudent in their lending practices having learned the lessons of the early s and hence building is far less speculative 
management does not see significant risk of a slowdown in real estate in however  it should be noted that high real estate prices are creating a demographic trend of aging home owners replacing working class residents who find first time home ownership difficult 
this is contributing to an out migration by young families with working aged heads of households 
the impact of this demographic trend on the local economy and the types of businesses that operate here is unclear at the present time 
with positive indicators being revealed in the national economic statistics and a solid economic base locally  management is encouraged that should again be a solid year for the economy in the company s trade area 
this optimism  however  must be tempered by the potential for disruption resulting from geopolitical issues surrounding homeland security and terrorism 
as we noted last year  the effects of episodes such as the terrorist attacks  the wars in afghanistan and iraq  and the international tensions surrounding these events  can have a significant on economic activity 
in spite of this caveat  our local trade area again appears to be in a solid position at the start of to continue the recovery underway and maintain low unemployment rates 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system have started raising short term interest rates and management expects this trend to continue with the target fed funds rate reaching the mid range by year end 
management also expects that longer term rates will rise much more modestly  if at all  in keeping with a continue trend towards a flatter yield curve 
competitive factors competitive pressures from other financial institutions continue to be intense both in the company s trade area and throughout the nation 
many banks are suffering from insufficient loan volumes and have become very aggressive on the pricing of those good credits available 
in the company s tri counties service area  financial institutions banks and savings institutions operate offices serving billion in deposits based on data as of june  it should be noted that the trend toward consolidation of banking assets exhibited over the past few years in california continued in statewide  through november  banks are merging out of existence based on announced merger transactions 
according to the state department of financial institutions however  new banks have filed in to start a new bank in california  through november 
analysis of statement of financial position loans the bank experienced an increase in net loans from  million at the end of  to  million at the end of this represents an increase in the loan portfolio of million following the million increase in the loan portfolio represents approximately of the bank s assets 
additionally  loans held for sale which are single family residential mortgages pending sale total million at the end of  down from million one year earlier 
mid state bancshares trends in loan categories

the graph above displays the trend over the five year period ended december  in the various components of the loan portfolio 
construction loans have risen from their level five years earlier million at december  compared to million at year end real estate loans generally trended up from million at the end of to million at the end of home equity credit lines have generally increased from million at the end of compared to million at the end of consumer loans installment and credit reserve have decreased from million at december  to million at year end which is in part due to the sale in december of the company s credit card receivables 
commercial and other loans have grown in recent years through  with a decrease in  but grew to million at december  agricultural production loans have remained flat until  ending at million in december 
the bank expects to continue to emphasize all types of lending activity in order to diversify the risk in its portfolio 
the larger growth in real estate loans  especially in  reflects an expanded use of jumbo adjustable rate mortgage loans in the portfolio million at the end of the year along with the purchase of certain of these same type of loan assets in the secondary market million at the end of the year 
economic activity in the central coast will determine the types of credit the bank will be able to extend and hence its ability to achieve this objective 
the bank s allowance for losses stands at million  or of gross loans  and represents losses not yet realized  but inherent in the loan portfolio and on unfunded commitments 
the allowance for losses is down from the million at december  the year end balance now represents of non performing loans identical to the level at the end of a five year review of activity in the allowance for losses and an allocation by loan type of the allowance is shown in the tables below 
allowance for losses in s allowance for loan losses beginning of year allowance for losses unfunded commitments total allowance for losses provision for loan losses charged to operating expense provision for losses unfunded commitments charged to operating expense adjustments acquisition through merger loans charged off real estate loans installment loans commercial loans credit cards and related loans recoveries of loans previously charged off real estate loans installment loans commercial loans credit cards and related loans total allowance for losses allocation of allowance for losses in s allowance for loan losses allowance for losses unfunded commitments total allowance for losses ratio of net loan losses to average loans outstanding allocation of the allowance for losses compared to loan type as a percent of total at december type type type type type dollars in s balance applicable to as a of loans as a of loans as a of loans as a of loans as a of loans construction and land real estate hecl installment credit card and related commercial  other unfunded commitments n a n a n a n a n a unallocated n a n a n a n a n a balance at end of year non accrual loans within the bank s portfolio decreased from million as of december   to million  at the end of loans days or more past due  and still accruing  remained at zero for the periods ending december  and december  additional information on non accrual loans  past due loans and troubled debt restructurings can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
the level of non accrual loans at the end of is centered primarily in one real estate secured loan total million 
management has established specific reserves that would offset potential losses  if any  arising from less than full recovery of the loan from the supporting collateral 
recoveries in of loans previously charged off totaled million compared to charge offs of million taken during the year resulting in net recoveries of thousand 
this net recoveries figure compares to net charge offs incurred of million and million in and  respectively 
the bank anticipates that charge offs actual losses will continue during management does not anticipate that recoveries would again exceed charge offs in the coming year 
with the combination of the collateral securing the problem loans and the size of the allowance for losses  management feels that the allowance is sufficient to cover inherent losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance and also employs an independent third party loan review group to  among other things  review the reasonableness of individual asset classifications 
management  as necessary  adjusts the allowance on a regular basis 
the allowance is also examined annually by one or more of the bank s regulatory bodies including the fdic and dfi 
during the fourth quarter of  based on its review of the allowance  management took a benefit to the provision for loan losses of million resulting in a net benefit to the provision for loan losses of just under million for the full year 
again during the second quarter of  management took a further benefit to the provision for loan losses of million 
these actions reflected strong credit quality standards  consistent performance of the loan portfolio in recent years  improving trends in classified loans  improving trends in delinquencies and charge offs  an improved outlook for the collection of the company s non accrual loans  and an improved outlook for economic activity in general 
the need for additional provision for loan losses or for further benefit to the provision for loan losses in will be dependent upon management s on going analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management believes it to be adequate at the present time  the appropriate value can fluctuate over time in response to economic conditions and the subjective decisions which must be made in response to those conditions 
the allowance for losses consists of a statistically allocated portion and a specifically allocated portion 
the total of these components is considered adequate to provide for losses  which can be reasonably anticipated 
however  since these amounts are based on estimates  ultimate losses relating to these loans may vary and management believes that qualitative factors make it prudent to carry a reasonable level of an unallocated portion to absorb losses in excess of the allocated portion 
qualitative factors considered include  but are not limited to  portfolio composition  concentrations  off balance sheet risks  delinquencies and non accruals  criticized and classified loans  non performing loans  gross and net loan losses  changes in lending function  changes in management  the bank s organizational structure  the special assets group  lending and credit approval authorities  loan officer training  the credit review function  and real estate appraisal policies 
management continuously monitors residential real estate reports and markets  and is aware of press articles that have discussed a possible slow down and or drop in value of residential real estate in the bank s service area 
while long term interest rates remain historically low and the bank s service area is marked by limited supply and strong demand  residential projects financed by the bank are underwritten with a requirement of a percentage of cash equity to the total cost of the project in addition to prudent exposures to current appraised values 
to further mitigate this risk  individual projects financed are analyzed using direct  current and historical project trends with limitations to production unit starts ahead of sales using the projected absorption analysis contained in the appraisal of each project 
the bank believes  based upon past experience  that this process helps mitigate against the production of a supply of units that would exceed the current market demand 
additionally  due to the popularity of our market area to urban retirees and others wanting to enjoy the environment and life style it provides  we have seen and continue to see a migration of wealthier individuals and families absorb the residential housing production with greater cash equities than is typical of other areas throughout the country 
this assumption is supported by the fact that the bank s portfolio of residential mortgages have an average loan to value ratio of less than along with average credit scores substantially exceeding industry standards with low delinquency ratios 
a summary of maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates at december  is shown in the table below 
a more complete discussion of the bank s exposure to changes in interest rates can be found in the md a under the section titled net interest income and interest rate risk

to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed composition of the investment portfolio 
overall  the portfolio showed a net reduction in outstanding balances over the course of as the bank redirected these earning assets into the loan portfolio and to a lesser extent the market value relative to amortized cost of the available for sale the investment portfolio declined 
the treasury and agency portion of the portfolio decreased by million from one year ago 
the bank maintained its holdings in the municipal bond portfolio fairly steady from a market value of million at the end of  to a market value of million at the end of mortgage back securities increased somewhat by million 
in total however  the bank decreased its investment portfolio from a market value of million at the end of to a market value of million at the end of  a million decrease 
the bank may segregate its portfolio into three categories a trading portfolio which is carried at market value  with changes in market value reflected in the income statement  a held to maturity portfolio which is carried at amortized cost  with changes in market value having no impact on the financial statements and an available for sale portfolio which is carried at market value  with changes in market value reflected in comprehensive income 
the bank holds no securities that should be classified as trading or held to maturity securities 
the bank has determined that since its securities may be sold prior to maturity because of interest rate changes  to meet liquidity needs  or to better match the re pricing characteristics of funding sources  that the entire portfolio should be classified as available for sale 
adjustments to the available for sale portfolio for changes in market values resulted in an unrealized gain of million included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  compared to an unrealized gain of million at december   net of related taxes 
maturities and sales over the full year exceeded purchases and the total investment portfolio decreased by million from the end of to the end of shown below is a summary maturity distribution of the investment portfolio  by type and weighted taxable equivalent yield as of december  expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties

goodwill and core deposit intangibles goodwill totaled million at december  and of this total  million was the result of the acquisition of ojai valley bank that was completed on october   million was the result of the acquisition of american commercial bank that was completed on september  and million dates to a may  acquisition of citizens bank of paso robles by bsm bancorp which the company acquired in on an annual basis  the company tests its goodwill for impairment 
the goodwill is entirely attributable to the company s community banking segment 
results of this test have indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill in any of the past three years through since the testing commenced 
core deposit intangibles total million at december  compared to million one year earlier 
of the year end amounts  million represents the net un amortized value of the core deposit intangible created with the american commercial bank acquisition and million represents the net un amortized value of the core deposit intangible created upon the acquisition of ojai valley bank 
in connection with these acquisitions  the company recognizes core deposit intangibles which represent the fair value of long term deposit relationships acquired 
such amounts are then amortized over originally expected useful economic lives of and years  respectively 
absent adjustments to the amortization schedules in future periods  the core deposit intangibles will be fully amortized in december with respect to the american commercial bank acquisition and october with respect to the ojai valley bank acquisition deposits while the bank is competitive with major institutions in terms of its structure of interest rates on deposit products offered  management was not overly aggressive during in terms of pricing to attract additional deposits  a decision which reflects the bank s strong liquidity at the present time 
as discussed in the income statement analysis  many of the bank s deposit rates have risen in concert with the general increase in rates 
a comparison of the rates paid on the bank s deposit products at december  and is as follows selected quoted interest rates change demand deposits now account better over  money market deposits over  passbook savings account individual retirement account year term time deposit  month term wall street journal prime rate average deposits have risen steadily over the past three years reflecting growth at mid state bank trusts existing offices and the acquisition of ojai valley bank on october  which had deposits of approximately million at the time of the acquisition 
below is a summary of the average deposits outstanding and the average rate paid by category over the last three years 
average average average dollars in s balance interest rate balance interest rate balance interest rate interest bearing demand and money market investment accounts savings accounts time deposits total interest bearing deposits non interest bearing demand total deposits the majority of the bank s time deposits approximately have balances that are under  in size 
while all time deposits are somewhat more rate sensitive than the bank s other deposit categories  the smaller time deposit balances tend to be more stable and less sensitive to absolute rate levels than do time deposits of  or more 
approximately of the bank s time deposits mature within one year and would be potentially subject to a change in rate on their maturity date 
the following table as of december   displays summary size and maturity information on the bank s time deposits 
after three after six three months to months dollars in s months or six to after balance by size less months one year one year total under   or more total time deposits other borrowings while not a significant component of the bank s structure  other borrowings were million  at the end of compared to million at the end of these consist of borrowings under the us treasury tax and loan note account  federal home loan bank borrowings and mortgages payable 
the bank had outstanding borrowings of million and million at december  and  respectively  under the us treasury tax and loan note account program 
the bank had one borrowing from the federal home loan bank for million at december  and mortgages payable were zero and thousand at year end and  respectively 
the company may increase its other borrowings during in an effort to purchase earning assets which create a positive spread for the income statement and allow it to more profitably leverage its strong capital base 
management could borrow up to million of mostly shorter term borrowings up to five years from sources such as the federal home loan bank 
funds raised this way would be used to purchase earning assets such as investment securities or generate additional loans at sufficiently positive spreads to justify the additional leverage 
capital capital ratios for commercial banks and their holding companies in the united states are generally calculated using three different formulas 
these calculations are referred to as the leverage ratio and two risk based calculations known as tier one risk based capital ratio and the total risk based capital ratio 
the company and the bank are subject to certain standards concerning these ratios 
these standards were developed through the joint efforts of banking authorities from different countries around the world 
the standards essentially take into account the fact that different types of assets have different levels of risk associated with them 
further  they take into account the off balance sheet exposures of banks when assessing capital adequacy 
the leverage ratio calculation simply divides common stockholders equity reduced by goodwill and certain other intangibles that a bank may have by the total assets of the bank 
in the tier one risk based capital ratio  the numerator is the same as the leverage ratio  but the denominator is the total risk weighted assets of the bank 
risk weighted assets are determined by segregating all the assets and off balance sheet exposures into different risk categories and weighting them by a percentage ranging from lowest risk to highest risk 
the total risk based capital ratio again uses risk weighted assets in the denominator  but expands the numerator to include other capital items besides equity such as a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses  long term capital debt  preferred stock and other instruments 
summarized below are the capital ratios at december  and  for both mid state bancshares and mid state bank trust 
additionally  the standards for a well capitalized institution  as defined by the federal banking agencies  are displayed 
minimum well capitalized mid state mid state regulatory regulatory bancshares bank trust standard standard leverage ratio tier one risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio while it is the intent of management to continue to maintain strong capital ratios  the board of directors has initiated a stock repurchase program and increased the quarterly dividend payments in an effort to further leverage its equity and enhance shareholder value 
the company also expects to modestly increase its other borrowings as noted above under other borrowings and increase its capital leverage 
without deducting for goodwill and other intangibles from equity  two other commonly followed ratios related to capital have trended as follows over the past three years 
dividend payout ratio average common equity to average assets liquidity the focus of the bank s liquidity management is to ensure its ability to meet cash requirements 
sources of liquidity include cash  due from bank balances net of federal reserve requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities  fed funds sold  investment securities net of pledging requirements  loan repayments  deposits and fed funds borrowing lines 
typical demands on liquidity are deposit run off from demand deposits and savings accounts  maturing time deposits  which are not renewed  and anticipated funding under credit commitments to customers 
the bank has adequate liquidity at the present time 
its loan to deposit ratio at year end was versus one year earlier 
the bank normally strives for a loan to deposit ratio in the to range 
the bank s internally calculated liquidity ratio stands at at december  compared to one year earlier 
these levels are above the bank s minimum policy of 
management is not aware of any trend  demand  commitment or event that would result in a material change in the bank s liquidity at the present time 
capital commitments as of december   neither the company or the bank have any material commitment for capital expenditures 
contractual obligations as of december   the bank had the following contractual obligations 
less than one to three three to five over one year years years five years total long term debt operating leases total contractual obligations off balance sheet and other related party transactions as noted in footnote to the financial statements  the company is contingently liable for letter of credit accommodations made to its customers in the ordinary course of business totaling million at december   down from million one year earlier 
additionally  the company has undisbursed loan commitments  also made in the ordinary course of business  totaling million  which was up from the million outstanding one year earlier 
the company has an allowance for losses unfunded commitments totaling  and  at december  and  respectively  to cover losses inherent in its letter of credit accommodations and undisbursed loan commitments 
there are no special purpose entity spe trusts  corporations  or other legal entities established by mid state which reside off balance sheet 
there are no other off balance sheet items other than the aforementioned items related to letter of credit accommodations and undisbursed loan commitments 
as noted in footnote to the financial statements  the company does make loans and leases to related parties directors and officers in the ordinary course of business at prevailing rates and terms 
these loans and leases totaled million and million at the end of and  respectively 
income statement analysis net interest income and interest rate risk net interest income is the difference between interest and fees earned on all earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for was million  up from million recorded in and million in the components of net interest income change in response to both changes in rate  average balance and mix of both earning assets and liabilities 
the following tables present an analysis of yields rates  interest income and expense  and average balances for   and analysis of changes in interest income and expense compared to composition of change average interest income average yield average interest income average yield change due to total dollars in s balance expense rate balance expense rate volume rate change earning assets loans investment securities fed funds  other total earning assets interest bearing liabilities now  savings  and money market accounts time deposits interest bearing deposits other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities net interest income compared to composition of change average interest income average yield average interest income average yield change due to total dollars in s balance expense rate balance expense rate volume rate change earning assets loans investment securities fed funds  other total earning assets interest bearing liabilities now  savings  and money market accounts time deposits interest bearing deposits other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities net interest income during there was a million increase in interest income along with a decrease of million in interest expense compared to the resulting million increase in net interest income for was a result of a number of dynamics affecting both average balance and interest rate considerations 
first  the company experienced an increase in its average earning assets outstanding of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the net increase in average loans  which were up by million  and to a lesser extent to an increase in average investments of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in average federal funds sold of million 
second  while the company s average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  earning assets increased by a larger million 
third  earning asset yields were somewhat lower in compared to the average for and liability costs did not drop as quickly 
during there was a million decrease in interest income along with a decrease of million in interest expense compared to the resulting million increase in net interest income for was a result of a number of dynamics affecting both average balance and interest rate considerations 
first  the company experienced an increase in its average earning assets outstanding of million 
the increase was divided amongst a net increase in average loans of million  an increase in average investments of million and an increase in average federal funds sold of million 
second  while the company s average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  earning assets increased by a larger million 
the increases in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are partly attributable to the acquisition of ojai valley bank on october  which affected the averages of these categories through the influence of their balances for the last two months of the year in with no corresponding influence in third  interest rates were lower in compared to the average for for example  the prime rate averaged in compared to in the bank expects its risk exposure to changes in interest rates to remain manageable and well within acceptable policy ranges 
a recent review as of the end of of the potential changes in the bank s net interest income over a month time horizon showed that it could fluctuate under extreme alternative rate scenarios from between and of the base case rates unchanged of million 
the bank s policy is to maintain a structure of assets and liabilities which are such that net interest income will not vary more than plus or minus of the base forecast over the next months 
management expects that its exposure to interest rate risk is manageable and it will continue to strive for an optimal trade off between risk and earnings 
the following table presents a summary of the bank s net interest income forecasted for the coming months under alternative interest rate scenarios 
change from base rates down very significant prime down to over months rates down significant prime down to over months rates down modestly prime down to over months base case rates unchanged prime unchanged at over months rates up modestly prime up to over months rates up aggressive prime up to over months rates up very aggressive prime up to over months net interest income under the above scenarios is influenced by the characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
in the case of now  savings and money market deposits total billion interest is based on rates set at the discretion of management ranging from to 
in a downward rate environment  there is a limit to how far these deposit instruments can be re priced and this behavior is similar to that of fixed rate instruments 
in an upward rate environment  the magnitude and timing of changes in rates on these deposits is assumed to be more reflective of variable rate instruments 
it is important to note that the above table is a summary of several forecasts and actual results may vary 
the forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions of management that may turn out to be different and may change over time 
factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to competitors behavior  economic conditions both locally and nationally  actions taken by the federal reserve board  customer behavior  and management s responses 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have significant effects on the bank s net interest income 
therefore the results of this analysis should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
historically  the bank has been able to manage its net interest income in a fairly narrow range reflecting the bank s relative insensitivity to interest rate changes 
the impact of prepayment behavior on mortgages  real estate loans  mortgage backed securities  securities with call features  etc 
is not considered material to the sensitivity analysis 
over the last years  the bank s net interest margin which is net interest income divided by average earning assets of the bank has ranged from a low of to a high of not taxable equivalent 
the bank s net interest margin in of is at the low end of this range by historical standards  coming off the higher levels experienced in of 
this is a result of both the lower level of interest rates and the change in mix of earning assets the bank now has a smaller portion in loans vis vis investment securities compared to when the margin was at its widest level 
the net interest margin under the alternative scenarios ranges from to 
management feels this range of scenarios  while lower than historical standards  is consistent with current experience and interest rate levels  but no assurances can be given that actual future experience will fall within this range 
the bank s exposure with respect to interest rate derivatives  exchange rate fluctuations  and or commodity price movements is nil 
the bank does not own any instruments within these markets 
provision for loan losses the company made a provision to the allowance for loan losses of thousand in in and however  it reduced the allowance for loan losses by million and thousand  respectively  through a benefit to the provision for loan losses 
these actions reflected strong credit quality standards  consistent performance of the loan portfolio in recent years  improving trends in classified loans  improving trends in delinquencies and charge offs  an improved outlook for the collection of the company s non accrual loans  and an improved outlook for economic activity in general 
the need for additional provision for loan losses or for further benefit to the provision for loan losses in will be dependent upon management s on going analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate at the present time  the appropriate value can fluctuate over time in response to economic conditions and the subjective decisions which must be made in response to those conditions 
non interest income non interest income for totaled million compared to million in and million in service charges on deposit accounts increased million to million in compared to following an increase of million to million in versus the increase in compared to primarily reflects the implementation of a new decision plan module for handling non sufficient fund and overdraft accounts and the merger with ojai valley bank 
the increase in over reflects an increase in accounts and the merger with ojai valley bank  but no significant increases in service charge rates 
commissions  fees and other service charges decreased by million in to million 
this followed an increase of million in over the decrease in compared to related primarily to a drop in merchant processing income as a result of outsourcing this activity late in the year 
the increase in related to several items including a thousand increase in income from the trust and investment division  a thousand increase in mortgage loan processing fees  a thousand increase in real estate loan servicing fees  a thousand increase in debit card fees and a thousand increase in atm fees and surcharges 
management expects this category to decrease in as a result of outsourcing its merchant processing functions and receiving a payment which is net of expenses 
gains on sales of securities increased to thousand in following thousand and thousand gains in and  respectively 
the gain in reflected the acceptance of a tender offer for a million block of corporate bonds held by the bank resulting in a thousand gain in the first quarter and the sale of an additional security the put feature of which was no longer applicable at a gain of thousand in the third quarter 
the gain on sale of loans held for sale single family mortgages was thousand in compared to million in and million in the higher levels in late and through much of reflected the large amount of mortgage refinance activity experienced as a result of the historically low mortgage interest rate levels 
all other sources of income were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in is related to a million gain on sale of oreo which was partially offset by declines in miscellaneous recoveries 
the increase in was a one time gain on the sale of bank property of thousand and thousand realized from the on going commissions on the sale of property formerly owned by mid coast land company 
non interest expense total non interest expense for was million  following million in  and million in results in reflect two months of overhead created by the acquisition of ojai valley bank followed by a full year in for the combined mid state and ojai operation  expenses are estimated to be approximately million annually lower than the sum of the two institutions on a stand alone basis 
savings have been realized due to reduced data processing costs  reduced salary and benefit costs  reduced directors fees  reduced insurance costs  and other similar savings 
salaries and employee benefits increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in was a result of including the addition of employees from the acquisition of ojai valley bank resulting in approximately million more salaries and benefits expense  increases in the company cost of health care coverage for employees and workers compensation premiums of approximately thousand  and the balance being regular salary increases 
the increase in over reflected a thousand increase in total salaries paid  along with a million increase in employee benefit incentive expense reflecting both the improved performance of the bank and enhancements made to the plan to remain competitive in recruiting  hiring and retaining the most qualified staff possible 
management considers containment of salaries and benefits costs in and beyond to be one of its top challenges 
a number of factors are continuing to create unusually strong upward pressure on these costs  especially in the areas of medical benefits  workers compensation costs and competitive wages 
also  during the third quarter of  the company will implement a change in accounting for stock options which will require it to take a charge to benefits expense based on the grant date fair value of its stock option awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period 
see note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements which follows in item of this report 
the company is addressing these cost pressures by focusing on ways of becoming more efficient in its processes and using technology wherever possible to hold down staffing requirements 
occupancy expense increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in over reflects a thousand dollar increase in depreciation expense resulting from new fixed assets put in service  a thousand increase in rental expense largely because of the new ojai facilities and other miscellaneous increases in maintenance  repairs and utilities 
the increase in reflects primarily increases in facilities maintenance of thousand  increases in facilities rents of thousand and increases in depreciation expense of thousand 
the purchase of a new mainframe computer system during the middle of did not have a significant impact on depreciation costs because of the parallel reduction in depreciation expense from the retirement of the old system 
the purchase of new item imaging equipment which is improving checking account processing and research capabilities for customers  along with improving the efficiency of the bank  did have a modest impact on depreciation expense for the year 
advertising and promotion expenditures were million in following charges of million in and million in the increase in reflects a planned increase of million in the company s marketing budget in support of an expanded awareness campaign in the relatively new ventura county market and increased consumer loan sales efforts 
the company does not expect any major increases in its expenditures and anticipates they will approximate the levels 
general office expenditures were million in following levels of million in and million in while this category of expenditure has been relatively flat in recent years  the small increase in reflects the recent ojai acquisition 
this category includes primarily charges for stationery and supplies  telephone expenses  and postage 
management does not expect any significant changes to this category in merchant processing and data processing charges were million in  million in and million in the decline in reflects the outsourcing of this function to an outside vendor late in the year 
management s expectation for is that merchant processing and data processing expense will decrease as a result of outsourcing this function 
professional services were million in following million in and million in the increase in over reflects increased costs of thousand for the company s outside accounting firm and its outsourced internal audit firm to comply with the sarbanes oxley act  section requirements pertaining to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
the increase in over relates primarily to the utilization of outside consultants to develop enhancements to the company s retail banking sales efforts 
management expects that there will be a reduction of a portion of the sarbanes oxley related costs in  but that on an on going basis there will be a permanent increase in these costs which is approximately half of the one time costs in regulatory assessments charges for fdic assessments and dfi fees have grown with the size of the bank over the past three years at   and thousand in   and  respectively 
this trend is likely to continue as the bank grows 
other operating expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease in reflects a thousand decrease in the provision for losses on unfunded commitments 
the increase in compared to reflects an increase in the provision for losses on unfunded commitments  an increase in other real estate owned expense and an increase in interest charged off from prior periods on special assets 
taxes book tax expense amounted to million in  million in  and million in while the statutory tax rate of the company is  the actual rate accrued was   and in   and  respectively 
the primary reason for the difference relates to the tax exempt income generated by the company s municipal bond portfolio 
the small decline in the accrued rate in reflects a modest increase in municipal tax exempt income 
as described in footnote no 
to the financial statements  the company has deferred tax assets primarily related to the timing difference associated with charge offs and provisions for losses on certain loans and with the timing difference on deferred compensation 
subsidiary activity mid coast land company mid coast land company recorded a profit of thousand in following thousand in net income in and a loss of thousand in the gain in and primarily relates to the on going commissions on the sale of property formerly owned by mid coast land company 
management expects earnings to continue for several years as there are lots remaining to be sold at the start of which are subject to the payment of these commissions 
the loss in was related to the write off of a note carried by the subsidiary to a developer for which no allowance had been provided based on the conditions of the loan prior to mid coast land company is no longer engaged in real estate development activity  having sold its final property which closed during the first quarter of it currently records residual activity resulting from prior years operations

critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as  disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
management believes that the most significant subjective judgements that it is required to make include the following allowance for losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance and also employs an independent third party loan review group to  among other things  review the adequacy of the allowance and make recommendations 
management  as necessary  adjusts the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for losses unfunded commitments  on a regular basis 
these adjustments are made through a charge to expense or a benefit in the provision for loan losses on the income statement 
the allowance is also examined annually by one or more of the bank s regulatory bodies including the fdic and dfi 
the need for additional provision for loan losses in  or a benefit to the provision for loan losses  will be dependent upon management s on going analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for losses 
while management believes it to be adequate at the present time  the appropriate value can fluctuate over time in response to economic conditions and the subjective decisions which must be made in response to those conditions 
fair value 
where applicable  the company is required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap to disclose the fair value of financial instruments and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate those fair values 
also  the fair value calculated on collateral supporting the bank s extensions of credit eg appraisals on the property securing real estate loans can have a significant effect on the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for losses noted above 
wherever possible  fair value used by the company equals quoted market price  as for example with its investment securities portfolio  if available 
if it is not available  fair value is estimated by the company using quoted market prices for similar assets 
fair value of other instruments involves discounting future cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturity and credit characteristics 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the corporation to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
taxes 
the company estimates its quarterly effective income tax rate based upon a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the expected revenues for the year and the product mix of revenue  and the ratio of permanent differences to total revenue 
any changes to the estimated rate are made prospectively in accordance with apb interim financial reporting 
additionally  a valuation allowance  which was zero at december  and  provides for deferred taxes that are not anticipated to be offset by taxable income projected for the next months 
a valuation allowance is based on estimates by management which can change over time 
goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
the company is required by gaap to perform an annual impairment analysis of the amount of goodwill showing on its consolidated statement of financial position 
the methodology utilized in this analysis is described under goodwill and core deposit intangibles earlier in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
