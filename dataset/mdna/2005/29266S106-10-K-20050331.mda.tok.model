item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in additional factors affecting our business and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview our business we are engaged in the development  manufacture  marketing and sale of minimally invasive therapies for the treatment of vascular disease 
our primary focus is the marketing and sale of the powerlink system  a catheter based alternative treatment to surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms  or aaa 
aaa is a weakening of the wall of the aorta  the largest artery of the body 
once aaa develops  it continues to enlarge and if left untreated becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture 
the overall patient mortality rate for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms is approximately  making it the th leading cause of death in the united states 

table of contents prior to the acquisition of former endologix and the restructuring that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of see below under the caption merger with endologix  inc  we were researching  developing and marketing a radiation therapy catheter for the treatment of blockages in arteries after angioplasty  or restenosis 
prior to that we developed  manufactured and marketed other catheter and stent products for treatment of cardiovascular disease 
between and  our source of revenues shifted gradually from direct sales of previous catheter and stent products to royalties from licenses of our stent delivery technology 
in june  we licensed to guidant corporation rights to manufacture and distribute products using our focus technology for the delivery of stents in exchange for milestone and royalty payments 
our license revenue has significantly decreased and we anticipate that it will continue to decrease during and that the sales of our powerlink system will become our only material source of revenue by the first half of we have experienced an operating loss for each of the last five years and expect to continue to incur annual operating losses through at least december  due primarily to expenditures to build our sales  marketing and distribution capability 
our results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter  and we expect that our results of operations will continue to vary significantly in the future 
our quarterly operating results depend upon several factors  including our ability to penetrate the market now that regulatory approval for the powerlink system has been achieved  the timing and amount of expenses associated with the ongoing clinical testing of the powerlink system  the timing and amount of expenses required to support commercial launch  and for selling and administrative expense  varying licensed product sales by guidant corporation  and  outcomes from future partnering or technology acquisition agreements  if any 
company restructuring prior to  we were developing a radiation therapy catheter for the treatment of blockages in arteries after angioplasty  or restenosis 
as a result of the clinical efficacy of drug coated stents  we determined that the market for the radiation based system likely will be limited 
in order to conserve cash and to position ourselves to take advantage of strategic alternatives  we restructured our business  resulting in the wind down of the development work for the radiation catheter system 
merger with former endologix  inc in may  we acquired all of the capital stock of former endologix 
we paid stockholders of former endologix cash for each share of former endologix common stock  for an aggregate of million  and issued one share of our common stock for each share of former endologix common stock  for an aggregate of  shares 
we accounted for the acquisition for as a purchase under sfas no 
 business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in the merger  we acquired  in addition to the net tangible assets of the business  intangible assets such as the powerlink and powerweb an earlier version of the powerlink technologies  both developed and in process  the endologix trade name and powerlink and powerweb trademarks  and goodwill 
we employed valuation techniques reflecting recent guidelines from the aicpa on approaches and procedures for identifying and allocating the purchase price to assets to be used in research and development activities  including acquired in process research and development  or ipr d 
to value ipr d and developed technology  we estimated their future net cash flows and discounted them to their present value 
to 
table of contents value trademarks and tradenames  we estimated the royalties that would have been paid for their use and discounted them to their net present value 
to determine the proper allocation of purchase price to technology assets  we first determined whether technological feasibility had been reached for a particular technology based upon whether it had been approved for sale by the appropriate regulatory body  or  in the absence of regulatory approval  whether there existed any material costs yet to be incurred  material changes to the technology to be completed or material risks of approval for sale 
then  we considered whether the technology had any alternative future uses 
if technological feasibility of projects had not been reached and the technology had no alternative future uses  we considered the technology to be ipr d 
the ipr d is comprised of technological development efforts aimed at the discovery of new  technologically advanced knowledge  the conceptual formulation and design of possible alternatives  as well as the testing of process and product cost improvements 
specifically  these technologies included  but were not limited to  research and development efforts towards us commercialization and expansion of the powerlink product line to include a larger size of the device 
we then estimated that we would spend million to complete the regulatory process for us commercialization of the powerlink system by mid we also estimated that we would spend million to complete the research and development and regulatory approval process for a larger size powerlink system for commercialization in europe by late  and in the us by mid we then determined the weighted average stage of completion for ipr d projects was approximately for us commercialization of the powerlink system and for the development and commercialization of the larger size of the powerlink system as of merger date 
the cash flows from revenues forecasted in each period are reduced by related expenses  capital expenditures  the cost of working capital  and an assigned contribution to the core technologies serving as a foundation for the research and development 
the discount rates applied to the individual technology s net cash flows were  based upon the level of risk associated with a particular technology and the current return on investment requirements of the market 
the amount of merger consideration allocated to ipr d was then determined by estimating the stage of completion of each ipr d project at the date of the merger  estimating the cash flows for the future research and development  clinical trials and release of products employing these technologies  all as described above  and discounting the net cash flows to their present values 
as a result of the foregoing determinations  we expensed the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d of million during the year ended december  we also determined the fair value of developed technology at the merger date to be million  which represents the acquired  aggregate fair value of individually identified technologies that were fully developed at the time of the merger 
as with the ipr d  the developed technology was valued using the income approach and a discount rate of  in context of the business enterprise value of the former endologix 
we determined a value of million for trademarks and tradenames based upon the estimated royalty that would have to be paid for the right to use these assets if they had not been acquired by us  and a discount rate of 
the residual amount of million was allocated to goodwill 
the developed technology that we acquired consisted of a large diameter mm cuff  which would be used to adapt a powerlink system to patients with larger diameter aortas  and the powerlink system 
although we do not believe that there has been a material change to the development timeline or costs for the technologies  our development of the european market for these technologies did take longer than we had projected 
as a result  we did not realize the sales revenue and operating results originally projected for we did not meet the projected results for due to a later than expected us regulatory approval date for the powerlink system 
we originally projected such approval for the infrarenal powerlink system in the first half of but it occurred in the fourth quarter of as a result  product sales and operating results for were adversely affected 
we do not  however  believe that the projected results over the lives of the assets will be adversely affected 
failure to achieve projected results  which could for example result from delays in the development of the technology  or our inability to gain regulatory approval in key markets  will adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition and may result in a write down or write off of intangible assets acquired in the merger 
the trademarks and trade names have an indefinite life and the developed technology is being amortized over ten 
table of contents years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the accounting for the merger 
significant accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to collectibility of customer accounts  whether the cost of inventories can be recovered  the value assigned to and estimated useful life of intangible assets  the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities  contingent liabilities and the potential outcome of litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following significant accounting policies and estimates were used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and accounts receivable we comply with the revenue recognition guidelines in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a fully executed arrangement exists a customer specific contract or a valid purchase order from an approved customer the sales price is fixed or determinable collection of the relevant receivable is probable at the time of sale products have been shipped and the customer has taken ownership and assumed risk of loss we earn royalty revenue  which is included in license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations  as a result of the sale of product rights and technologies to third parties 
royalties are recognized upon the sale of products subject to the royalty  by the third party 
we do not offer rights of return or price protection and does not have any post delivery obligations other than warranty 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on our review of the aging of customer balances  correspondence with the customer  and the customer s payment history 
if additional information becomes available to us indicating the financial condition of the customer is deteriorating  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  as driven by economic and market conditions  and the product s shelf life 
if actual demand  or economic or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we record an impairment charge  or expense  for long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value recorded for the asset may not be recoverable 
future changes in operations could cause us to write down the asset ie  record an expense to better reflect our current 
table of contents estimate of its value 
our goodwill will be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill is impaired 
factors that may impact whether there is a potential impairment include a significant decrease in our stock price and our evaluation of a control premium that may be used when estimating our total fair value 
our stock price may continue to decline  or other factors may arise  which could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
income taxes we reduce our deferred tax assets to zero due to uncertainties concerning the future realization of the related tax benefits  primarily due to our history of losses 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize some or all of the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance would be reduced  resulting in increased income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales increased to million in from million in us sales increased from  to  and sales to distributors outside the us increased from million to million 
sales to edwards lifesciences ag commenced in the second quarter of  and were million in total in other than edwards lifesciences ag  only bolton medical italia spa accounted for more than of product sales in sales to this distributor in were sales within the us were substantially comprised of powerlink systems for clinical trial cases 
we believe that product sales in will be substantially higher than in  in particular commercial sales of powerlink infrarenal products in the united states following the october approval by fda 
license revenue 
license revenue decreased to million in from million in royalties on licensed product sales by guidant decreased to  from million in starting in september  we believe that guidant replaced certain licensed products with unlicensed products in the united states 
we also believe that the introduction of drug coated stents in early has had a material negative effect on guidant s sale of licensed product 
we believe these trends will continue  and that royalties from guidant may approach the minimum annual amount of  in license revenue from escalon medical corporation were at the minimum  in both and our license agreement with escalon expired in october cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue increased to million from  in this increase is attributable to the higher unit volume of product sales in compared to gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in the decrease in gross profit resulted from the million decline in royalties received from guidant  which do not have an associated cost of revenue 
gross profit on product sales increased to million from  in because product sales volume more than doubled in from gross profit  as a percentage of product sales decreased to in from in this decrease in gross profit margin was due to a charge of  for excess and obsolete inventories in due to expiring product 
in  we had a benefit of  related to the recovery of previously reserved inventory 
we believe that gross profit dollars will increase significantly due to substantially higher commercial sales of the powerlink infrarenal product in the us we expect that gross profit as a percentage of product revenues will also increase 
research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses decreased by to million from million in the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in legacy radiation catheter technology clinical trial costs  as those trials were nearly completed in costs for the powerlink infrarenal clinical study also declined significantly as new enrollments were completed in we expect that research  development  and clinical expense will remain in the range between to million in 
table of contents marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from  in this increase was due to staffing increases in sales  marketing support  and customer services functions in anticipation of the commercial launch of the infrarenal powerlink system in the us market which occurred in the fourth quarter of we expect that sales and marketing expense will continue to increase at a substantial pace in general administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million in the increase in expenses in was due primarily to expenses of  related to our review of internal controls over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
additionally  the total in reflects a reimbursement of  for legal and other expenses as part of a settlement in the first quarter of with jomed endosonics  and net bad debt recoveries of  we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in  but decline meaningfully as a percentage of revenue 
other income expense 
other income increased to  from  in  driven by  higher interest income and  of foreign currency exchange gains in the period 
the increase in interest income was more than accounted for by a higher average invested cash balance in  which resulted from a private placement of  shares of our common stock at per share which yielded aggregate net proceeds of million in march in   was interest income recorded as part of a legal settlement with jomed endosonics corporation 
there was no corresponding amount in comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales increased to million in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  while adversely impacted by lower us clinical trial sales  product revenue for significantly increased  primarily due to the impact in of a full year of powerlink product sales  compared with seven months of powerlink product sales in  following the merger with former endologix 
our us clinical trial sales for decreased  compared with as we completed enrollment in the infrarenal arm of our pivotal us clinical trial in the first quarter of  and we stopped enrollment in the suprarenal arm of the trial for six months while we awaited review of the interim results by our data safety monitoring board  which occurred in november license revenue 
license revenue decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  our technology license agreement with guidant resulted in million and million in royalties in and  respectively 
we recognized  in minimum royalties in and  in minimum royalties in  under our agreement with escalon medical corporation 
we recognized  in deferred distributor fees in and none in under a distribution agreement with cosmotec ltd  regarding the distribution of our radiation therapy products in japan through our joint venture 
in december we agreed with cosmotec not to distribute the products and to dissolve the joint venture  at which time we recognized the remaining deferred distributor fee of  as revenue 
cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue increased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to having a full year of aaa product sales in and only seven months of aaa product sales in secondarily  the cost of product revenue for included a  write off of rdx product inventory 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to a decrease in royalties received from guidant  which do not have an associated cost of product revenue 
gross profit on product sales increased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   attributable primarily to having a full year of aaa product sales in and only seven months of aaa product sales in in addition  results included an 
table of contents  charge for product exchanges as part of the settlement and release agreement with two european distributors 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from an increase in powerlink technology development expenses of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in spending on radiation technology development as we were nearing the completion of the related clinical studies 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses decreased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in sales and marketing administrative staffing 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from a reimbursement in of legal costs and expenses of  which were previously expensed as general and administrative expenses  as part of a legal settlement with jomed endosonics  now part of volcano therapeutics 
a further reduction in general and administrative expenses resulting from bad debt recoveries of  and lower legal costs of  were offset by increases in outside service costs of  including strategic advisor fees  insurance costs of  and audit costs of  charge for acquired in process research and development 
we recognized a charge of million in the year ended december  as a result of the merger with the former endologix 
restructuring charges 
we recognized restructuring charges totaling  in the year ended december  based upon our reassessment and elimination of estimated sub lease income which we anticipated receiving 
other income expense 
other income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  the decrease in other income was due primarily to the decrease in interest income of  resulting from a lower average cash balance and a lower average interest rate on invested cash 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
historically  we have relied on the sale and issuance of equity securities to provide a significant portion of funding of our operations 
in july and march  we completed two private placements of our common stock  resulting in aggregate net proceeds of million 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of million 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for operating and capital expenditures through at least december  we expect to continue to incur substantial costs and cash outlays in to support powerlink research and development  manufacturing capability development  and the us market launch of the powerlink system 
however  if we fail to effectively penetrate the aaa market with the powerlink product  or if we fail to reduce certain discretionary expenditures  if necessary  we may need to seek additional sources of financing 
we may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms or at all  which would adversely affect the operations of our business 
in december  the board of directors approved the funding for a plan to relocate both our manufacturing and headquarters functions to a  square foot leased facility  located in irvine  ca 
we anticipate spending approximately million during for the construction of leasehold improvements  clean room space  equipment  and furniture for this facility 

table of contents the timing and amount of our future capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of market acceptance of the powerlink system  our requirements for additional manufacturing capacity  our requirements for additional office space  and the success of our research and development programs for future products 
in july  the board of directors authorized a program for repurchases of our outstanding common stock of up to million under certain parameters 
as of december   we have repurchased an aggregate of  shares for  with the last such purchase in the quarter ended september  accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable  net  increased to  at december  from  at december  the increase is due primarily to an increase in sales to edwards  a new european distributor in as of december   receivables from edwards amounted to  of the total net amount due 
other receivables 
other receivables decreased to  at december  from  at december  this was due to the decrease in royalties receivable from guidant 
see comparisons of and in subsection license revenue  regarding guidant royalty revenues  above 
inventories 
inventories increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is due to purchases of a key component of the powerlink product from bard peripheral vascular systems  in advance of fda approval for the product 
receipt of fda approval in october  is expected to result in a significant increase in future manufacturing requirements for this component 
deferred income taxes 
because of our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of realization of our net deferred income tax asset  we recorded an offsetting valuation allowance equal to of the net deferred income tax asset at both december  and december  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is attributable primarily to an increase in purchases from bard peripheral vascular systems for a key component of our powerlink system  a higher accrual for management bonuses earned in as compared to  a higher accrual for audit fees  and increases in other payables as a result of our preparations for the powerlink system launch in the us accrued compensation 
during  we issued performance units to certain employees under our performance compensation plan 
accrued compensation related to this plan in was  commitments in february  the former endologix agreed to purchase a key component for its powerlink product from bard peripheral vascular systems  a subsidiary of cr bard  inc  which at the time was a significant shareholder and thus a related party  under a supplier agreement that expires in december  and which then automatically renews for additional one year periods without notice  unless a party provides notice not to renew within thirty days from the expiration of the renewal period 
under the terms of the agreement  we have agreed to purchase certain unit quantities of the component  with built in annual quantity increases 
in january  the agreement was amended  increasing the minimum quantity purchase requirements for and thereafter and increasing the prices each year after according to the general increase in the consumer price index 
we are economically dependent on this vendor  which is the sole source for this key component 

table of contents during  we purchased million of such materials  which fulfilled its purchase commitment 
because we have now received fda approval to commercially distribute devices using the component  the terms of the agreement provide that prices for subsequent orders for the component will increase significantly 
as of december   expected future cash payments related to contractual obligations and commercial commitments were as follows total thereafter in s contractual obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligation a a represents estimates of obligations under the bard peripheral vascular systems component purchase contract 
the total cost of the components is determined by the mix of sizes of graft material that we purchase  as well as the number of components purchased 
under the agreement  each year we must buy of the minimum or actual number of units purchased  whichever is higher  in the prior year 
the cost of the component is determined by the size of the graft piece purchased  and we do not currently know what sizes we will be purchasing after for  we estimated the sizes to be purchased and for years thereafter until the contract terminates at the end of  we assumed that the minimum amount purchased increased each year 
please see the paragraph  above  for more information on the bard peripheral vascular systems agreement 
in june  we entered into an agreement under which a third party will develop  install and test manufacturing equipment for the expansion of our manufacturing capability 
over a period from january through march  we anticipate spending approximately  for this project 
in addition  the terms of the agreement also provide for estimated milestone payments totaling  during  we incurred costs of approximately  associated with this capital project 
we can terminate the agreement on days notice  and we would be responsible for costs incurred to the date of termination 
additional factors affecting our business our success depends on the safety and efficacy of the powerlink system in general use 
while we have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the powerlink system in our clinical studies with our clinical investigators  market acceptance will depend on similar results with the powerlink system in general use 
any significant difficulties or adverse events encountered in general use will impair the success of the powerlink system and our business 
our success depends on the growth in the number of aaa patient treated with endovascular devices 
of the estimated million people with aaa in the us  only about  are diagnosed annually  and of that amount only about  to  are treated with an endovascular device 
our success with our powerlink system will depend an increasing percentage of patients with aaa being diagnosed at earlier stages and any increasing percentage of those receiving endovascular  as opposed to open surgery procedures 
initiatives to increase screening for aaa are underway but are out of our control and such general screening programs may never gain wide acceptance 
the failure to diagnose more patients with aaa  at an earlier stage  will impede sales of powerlink systems 

table of contents our success depends on convincing a concentrated customer base of vascular surgeons and a limited number of interventional radiologists and cardiologists to use our product over alternative products and treatment modalities 
the physicians currently treating aaa have choices in treatment approach  one of which is endovascular aaa stent graft placement 
there are several competing endovascular stent grafts to choose from and we expect that number to increase 
increasing revenues from sales of powerlink systems will depend on our new marketing and sales team demonstrating that the powerlink system is a superior treatment alternative to watchful waiting  open surgery and competitive products 
we believe that this will required continued demonstration through clinical data and personal experience of the efficacy of the powerlink system 
while we intend to commit substantial resources to our marketing efforts  our competitors have superior resources to market and promote their endovascular stent graft products 
the most prominent devices that pose a competitive challenge to us include medtronic s aneurx  wl gore s excluder  and the cook zenith aaa system which are available in the us and europe  other aaa graft systems by medtronic  and johnson johnson  which currently have more limited availability  and other technologies in various phases of development  including pharmaceutical solutions 
any of these treatments could prove to be more effective or may achieve greater market acceptance than the powerlink system 
even if these treatments are not as effective as the powerlink system  many of the companies pursuing these treatments and technologies have significantly greater financial  management and other resources  more extensive research and development capability  established market positions  and larger sales and marketing organizations 
in addition  we believe that many of the purchasers and potential purchasers of our competitors products prefer to purchase medical devices from a single source 
accordingly  many of our competitors will have an advantage over us because of their size and range of product offerings 
any failure of our powerlink system to achieve clinical and commercial acceptance over our competitors will harm our business 
we cannot predict the extent to which third party payors may provide reimbursement for the use of the powerlink system 
our success in marketing the powerlink system depends in large part on whether domestic and international government health administrative authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse customers for the cost of our product 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries  and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country by country basis 
further  many international markets have government managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
in most markets there are private insurance systems as well as government managed systems 
if sufficient reimbursement is not be available for the powerlink system  or other any product that we may develop  in either the united states or internationally  the demand for our products will be adversely affected 
if government and third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our powerlink products  it will be very difficult for us to market our products to physicians and hospitals  and we may not achieve commercial success 

table of contents we are focused heavily on a single technology  the powerlink system 
we have focused heavily on the development and commercial launch of a single technology  the powerlink system because of limited resources 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize the existing powerlink system and reach positive cash flow from operations  we will be constrained in our ability to fund development and commercialization improvements and other product lines 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability 
from our formation in to december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  and incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  although we did receive fda marketing approval for the powerlink system in  we do not expect to be profitable in  and it is possible that we may never achieve profitability 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
this fluctuation may negatively impact our stock price in the future 
we cannot predict revenues for the sales of the powerlink system 
our quarterly revenues and results of operations may fluctuate in the future due to physician acceptance of the powerlink system  the conduct of clinical trials  the timing of regulatory approvals  fluctuations in our expenses associated with expanding our operations  variations in foreign exchange rates  and changes in third party payors reimbursement policies 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparison of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet investor expectations or those of public market analysts 
any unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts 
new information may cause investors and analysts to revalue our stock  which could cause a decline in value 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new and improved products 
our products must comply with regulatory requirements imposed by the fda and similar agencies in foreign countries 
these requirements involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities  an extensive fda review process and other costly and time consuming procedures 
it often takes several years to satisfy these requirements  depending on the complexity and novelty of the product 
we also are subject to numerous additional licensing and regulatory requirements relating to safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
some of the most important requirements we face include fda pre market approval process  california department of health services requirements  iso and eniso  and european union ce mark requirements 

table of contents government regulation may impede our ability to conduct continuing clinical trials of powerlink system enhancements and to manufacture the powerlink system and other prospective products 
government regulation also could delay our marketing of new products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities 
the fda and other regulatory agencies may not approve any of our products on a timely basis  if at all 
any delay in obtaining  or failure to obtain  such approvals could impede our marketing of any proposed products and reduce our product revenues 
our products remain subject to strict regulatory controls on manufacture  marketing and use 
we may be forced to modify or recall our product after release in response to regulatory action or unanticipated difficulties encountered in general use 
any such action could have a material effect on the reputation of our products and on our business and financial position 
further  regulations may change  and any additional regulation could limit or restrict our ability to use any of our technologies  which could harm our business 
we could also be subject to new federal  state or local regulations that could affect our research and development programs and harm our business in unforeseen ways 
if this happens  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations 
regulatory approval of our products in japan may be delayed or denied 
in japan  we have completed our clinical trials for the powerweb system and are working with the ministry of health for regulatory approval 
while we believe that we will receive regulatory approval in japan in the first half of  because this is the first aaa device submitted for approval  it is difficult for us to determine when or whether the device will be approved and if approved  when and whether the technology will obtain hospital reimbursement from the japanese medical authorities and permit commercialization 
in addition  any new product  or design  vendor or material change to the powerweb or powerlink system may require regulatory approval 
if we do not receive regulatory approval  we will not be able to commercialize the product 
if we fail to increase our direct sales force in a timely manner  our business could suffer 
we have a limited domestic direct sales force and we utilize a distribution network for sales outside of the us we expect to utilize a distribution network in connection with our intended future launch of sales in japan 
as we launch new products and increase our marketing efforts with respect to existing products  we will need to significantly expand the number of our direct sales personnel 
the establishment and development of a more extensive sales force will be expensive and time consuming 
there is significant competition for sales personnel experienced in relevant medical device sales 
if we are unable to attract  motivate and retain qualified sales personnel and thereby increase our sales force  we may not be able to increase our revenues 
our third party distributors may not effectively distribute our products 
we depend on medical device distributors and strategic relationships for marketing and sales of our powerlink system outside the united states 
we will depend directly on these distributors efforts to market our product  yet we will be unable to control their efforts completely 
if our distributors fail to market and sell our products effectively  our operating results and business may suffer substantially  or we may have to make significant additional expenditures to market our products 
if we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth  our business could suffer 
we may experience periods of rapid growth and expansion  which could place a significant strain on our limited personnel and other resources 
in particular  the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facility and the ongoing increase in our direct sales force will require significant management  technical and administrative resources 
any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals 
to achieve our revenue goals  we must successfully relocate our manufacturing capability in  and substantially increase as required by customer demand 
we may in the future experience difficulties in increasing production  including problems with 
table of contents production yields and quality control and assurance  component supply  and shortages of qualified personnel 
these problems could result in delays in product availability and increases in expenses 
any such delay or increased expense could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues 
future growth will also impose significant added responsibilities on management  including the need to identify  recruit  train and integrate additional employees 
in addition  rapid and significant growth will place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure 
in order to manage our operations and growth we will need to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our operating results and business could suffer 
we rely on a single vendor to supply our graft material for the powerlink system  and any disruption in our supply could delay or prevent us from producing the product for sale 
currently  we rely on bard peripheral vascular systems  a subsidiary of cr bard  inc  to supply us with graft material  which is a primary component for the powerlink system 
our reliance on a sole source supplier exposes our operations to disruptions in supply caused by failure of our supplier to comply with regulatory requirements  any strike or work stoppage  disruptions in shipping  a natural disaster caused by fire  floods or earthquakes  a supply shortage experienced by our sole source supplier  and the fiscal health and manufacturing strength of our sole source supplier 
although we retain a significant stock of the graft material  the occurrence of any of the above disruptions in supply or other unforeseen events that could cause a disruption in supply from our sole source graft supplier may cause us to halt or experience a disruption in manufacturing the powerlink system 
because we do not have alternative suppliers  our sales and profitability would be harmed in the event of a disruption 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property from infringement 
a failure to protect our technology may affect our business negatively 
the market for medical devices is subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
it is possible that our patents or licenses may not withstand challenges made by others or protect our rights adequately 
our success depends in large part on our ability to secure effective patent protection for our products and processes in the united states and internationally 
we have filed and intend to continue to file patent applications for various aspects of our technology 
however  we face the risks that we may fail to secure necessary patents prior to or after obtaining regulatory clearances  thereby permitting competitors to market competing products  and our already granted patents may be re examined  re issued or invalidated 
we also own trade secrets and confidential information that we try to protect by entering into confidentiality agreements with other parties 
however  the confidentiality agreements may not be honored or  if breached  we may not have sufficient remedies to protect our confidential information 
further  our competitors may independently learn our trade secrets or develop similar or superior technologies 
to the extent that our consultants  key employees or others apply technological information to our projects that they develop independently or others develop  disputes may arise regarding the ownership of proprietary rights to such information such disputes may not be resolved in our favor 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately  our business and commercial prospects likely will suffer 

table of contents if our current products or licensed products infringe upon the intellectual property of our competitors  the sale of these products may be challenged and we may have to defend costly and time consuming infringement claims 
we may need to engage in expensive and prolonged litigation to assert any of our rights or to determine the scope and validity of rights claimed by other parties 
with no certainty as to the outcome  litigation could be too expensive for us to pursue 
our failure to prevail in such litigation or our failure to pursue litigation could result in the loss of our rights that could hurt our business substantially 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  if at all 
our failure to obtain rights to intellectual property of third parties or the potential for intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling  making or using our products that use the disputed intellectual property  obtain a license from the intellectual property owner to continue selling  making  licensing or using our products  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  redesign our products or services  and subject us to significant liabilities to third parties 
if any of the foregoing occurs  we may be unable to manufacture and sell our products or license our technology and may suffer severe financial harm 
whether or not an intellectual property claim is valid  the cost of responding to it  in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  could harm our business 
our sales in international markets subject us to foreign currency exchange and costs which could harm our business 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from sales outside the united states 
for the fiscal years ended december   and international sales were   and of total product revenue  respectively 
foreign exchange gains or losses as a result of exchange rate fluctuations in any given period could harm our operating results and negatively impact our revenues 
additionally  if the effective price of our products were to increase as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  demand for our products could decline and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our international operations and our relationships with physicians and other consultants require us to comply with a number of us and international regulations 
we need to comply with a number of international regulations related to sales of medical devices in countries outside of the united states and contractual relationships with physicians in such countries 
in addition  we must comply with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which prohibits us companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business  direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage 
if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory held on consignment by our intended customers  we will not achieve our expected results 
a portion of our finished goods inventory is held on either temporary or permanent consignment by hospitals which purchase the inventory as they use it 
in these consignment locations  we do not have physical possession of the consigned inventory 
we therefore must rely on information from our customers as well as periodic inspections by our sales personnel and third party inventory auditors to determine when our products have been used 
if we are not able to effectively manage appropriate consigned inventory levels  we may suffer inventory losses which will reduce our gross profit levels 
there can be no assurance that any efforts to 
table of contents strengthen our monitoring and management of consigned inventory will be adequate to meaningfully reduce the risk of inventory loss 
we may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities 
manufacturing and marketing of our commercial products  and clinical testing of our products under development  may expose us to product liability claims 
although we have  and intend to maintain insurance  the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate and one or more successful claims brought against us may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  adverse product liability actions could negatively affect the reputation and sales of our products  our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products and may divert management s attention from other matters 
our operations are capital intensive  and we may need to raise additional funds in the future to fund our operations 
our activities are capital intensive 
although we believe that our existing cash resources and anticipated cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our planned capital requirements through at least december   we may require additional capital to fund on going operations 
our cash requirements in the future may be significantly different from our current estimates and depend on many factors  including the results of our commercialization efforts for the powerlink system  the time and costs involved in obtaining additional regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  the establishment of high volume manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  and  our success in entering into collaborative relationships with other parties 
to finance these activities  we may seek funds through additional rounds of financing  including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners 
we may be unable to raise funds on favorable terms  or not at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we issue debt securities  these securities could have rights superior to holders of our common stock  and could contain covenants that will restrict our operations 
we might have to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies  product candidates or products that we otherwise would not relinquish 
if adequate funds are not available  we might have to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our development programs  which could significantly impair our ability to operate our business 
our operations are currently conducted at a single location that may be at risk from earthquakes or other natural disasters 
we currently conduct all of our manufacturing  development and management activities at a single location in irvine  california  near known earthquake fault zones 
we have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities  including insurance  health and safety protocols  and off site storage of computer data 
however  any future natural disaster  such as an earthquake  could cause substantial delays in our operations  damage or destroy our equipment or inventory  and cause us to incur additional expenses 
a disaster could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
the insurance coverage we maintain against earthquakes and other natural disasters may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case 
the price of our stock may fluctuate unpredictably in response to factors unrelated to our operating performance 
the stock market periodically experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the market 
table of contents price of our common stock to drop 
in particular  the market price of securities of small medical device companies  like ours  has been very unpredictable and may vary in response to announcements by us or our competitors concerning technological innovations  introductions of new products  fda and foreign regulatory actions  developments or disputes relating to patents or proprietary rights  failure of our results of operations to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock  changes in healthcare policy in the united states or other countries  and general stock market conditions 
some provisions of our charter documents may make takeover attempts difficult  which could depress the price of our stock and inhibit your ability to receive a premium price for your shares 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our business  even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares without stockholder approval 
any such issuance could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our business and may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
in addition  our board of directors is divided into three classes for staggered terms of three years 
these provisions may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us  adversely affecting the market price of our common stock

sfas is effective during fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we currently have material exposure to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or other relevant market risks 
interest rate and market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment profile 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
at december   our investment portfolio included only high grade corporate bonds and commercial paper and government bonds all with remaining maturities of less than two years and denominated in us dollars
