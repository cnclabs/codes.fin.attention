item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition notice regarding forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements 
the words  anticipate  believe  expect  plan  intend  estimate  project  could  may  foresee  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements include information regarding expected development of the company s business  lending activities  relationship with customers  and development in the oil and gas industry 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially and adversely from those anticipated  believed  estimated or otherwise indicated 
overview production from tvog s existing reserves continues to decline  while demand increases 
while the trend for demand to outstrip available supplies is worldwide as well as national  we believe that it is particularly acute in california  our primary venue for exploration and production  which imports nearly of its oil and nearly of its natural gas demand 
oil prices tend to be set based on worldwide supplies and prices  while natural gas prices seem to be more dependent on local conditions 
we expect that gas prices will hold steady or possibly increase over this year 
if  however  prices should fall  for instance due to new regulatory measures or the discovery of new and easily producible reserves  our revenue from oil and gas sales would also fall 
in the company created a limited partnership called the opus i 
the purpose of this partnership is to raise one hundred million dollars by selling partnership interests 
with the funds raised we will drill up to twenty six exploratory wells  mostly in california  of which three are targeted for nevada 
we begin drilling for the opus i partnership as sufficient funds are invested to drill the next target 
for the year ended december   we have raised  and spent  on evaluating previously drilled wells on the oil creek  oil lake and elk ridge prospects 
we have determined to abandon these wells 
additionally  in we drilled one well on the los gatos prospect which was a dry hole and was abandoned 
tri valley continues grading and prioritizing our geologic library  which contains over california leads and prospects  for exploratory drilling 
we use our library to decide where we should seek oil and gas leases for future exploration 
from this library we were able to put together many of the prospects currently in opus i 
of course  we cannot be sure that any future prospect can be obtained at an attractive lease price or that any exploration efforts would result in a commercially successful well 
tri valley seeks to fund and drill enough exploratory wells for commercial discoveries to make up for the cost of the inevitable dry holes that we can expect in the exploration business 
the company believes our existing inventory of projects bears a high enough ratio of potentially successful to unsuccessful projects to deliver value to our drilling partners and our shareholders from successful wells  in excess of the total costs of all successful and unsuccessful projects 
our future results will depend on our success in finding new reserves and commercial production  and there can be no assurance what revenue we can ultimately expect from any new discoveries 
tri valley corporation does not engage in hedging activities and does not use commodity futures or forward contracts for cash management functions 
restatements during  the company documented and tested its system of internal controls in compliance with sarbanes oxley section from this activity  management determined its historic accounting procedures  surrounding revenue and cost recognition for its sales and performance surrounding turnkey drilling  were no longer appropriate and required an adjustment for fiscal year and the first two quarters for fiscal management therefore reported that its financial statements for the year  and for the first and second quarters of should no longer be relied upon because of these pending restatements 
the restatements decreased net income approximately  for the year ended december   increased net income by approximately  for the quarter ended march  and approximately  for the quarter ended june  the restatements for the december   k and the quarter ended march  result from a change in revenue recognition policy 
the restatement for the second quarter ended june  was due to the discovery of an expense that had been double charged and has now been corrected 
management determined these mismatching and accounting errors  which resulted in the restatements  were caused by a significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting 
in the third quarter of  management implemented procedures to prevent this in the future  see item a  controls and procedures 
the company receives monies from third parties who participate in drilling oil and gas wells and records this as revenue 
previously we recognized revenue and associated costs when the well was begun  as long as drilling was completed by close of books based on accrual accounting 
at the end of fiscal  we began drilling a turnkey well  which was taken to total depth by january  although we had collected all payment for the drilling by december   we had not completely performed the turnkey contract to total depth until after december  because the collected turnkey revenue was essentially nonrefundable  we had recorded the entire turnkey revenue and its associated drilling costs before the close of books based on accrual accounting rather than the date certain of the close of the fiscal year on december upon review of this practice  to remove all doubt  we now believe turnkey revenue and associated costs should be recorded when the well is drilled to total target depth and or logged 
we have changed our revenue recognition policy to recognize these payments as revenue only when drilling is actually completed and the well has been logged within the actual dates of the fiscal calendar year 
this change caused reported drilling revenue and related costs in to decrease and reported revenue and related costs in to increase 
additionally  reported revenue for the june  quarter increased approximately  due to a double entry of an expense 
during management s review of internal controls the double entry was discovered and the adjustment resulted in the increase in fiscal earnings 
the anticipated changes discussed above do not affect the company s ongoing cash flows
