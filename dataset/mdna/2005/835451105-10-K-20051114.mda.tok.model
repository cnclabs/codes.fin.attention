item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business 
sonic operates and franchises the largest chain of drive ins in the united states 
as of august   the sonic system was comprised of  drive ins  of which or were partner drive ins and or  were franchise drive ins 
sonic drive ins feature sonic signature items  such as specialty soft drinks including cherry limeades and slushes  frozen desserts  made to order sandwiches and hamburgers  extra long cheese coneys  hand battered onion rings  tater tots  salads  and wraps 
we derive our revenues primarily from partner drive in sales and royalties from franchisees 
we also receive revenues from initial franchise fees 
to a lesser extent  we also receive income from the selling and leasing of signs and real estate  as well as from minority ownership interests in a few franchise drive ins 
costs of partner drive in sales  including minority interest in earnings of drive ins  relate directly to partner drive in sales 
other expenses  such as depreciation  amortization  and general and administrative expenses  relate to the company s franchising operations  as well as partner drive in operations 
our revenues and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volumes of partner drive ins 
our revenues and  to a lesser extent  expenses also are affected by the number and sales volumes of franchise drive ins 
initial franchise fees and franchise royalties are directly affected by the number of franchise drive in openings 
overview of business performance 
business performance was strong during fiscal year as net income increased and earnings per share increased to per diluted share 
the sonic brand achieved several milestones during fiscal year  including surpassing the million mark in system wide average unit volumes  opening of the  th sonic drive in  and our th consecutive year of higher system wide same store sales 
we continue to experience considerable momentum in our business fueled by strong growth in same store sales that  despite some pressure on store level operating costs during the year  led to a significant increase in system wide average profit per store 
the rise in store level profits  in turn  helped produce a solid number of new drive in openings by franchisees 
we believe these results reflect our multi layered growth strategy that features the following components solid same store sales growth  increased franchising income stemming from solid same store sales growth and our unique ascending royalty rate  expansion of the sonic brand through new unit growth  particularly by franchisees  operating leverage at both the drive in level and the corporate level  and the use of excess operating cash flow for franchise acquisitions and share repurchases 
looking forward  these strategies are expected to continue to positively impact our business 
we expect revenue growth of between and for fiscal year  based upon same store sales growth in the target range of to 
this increase in revenues includes the expected benefit from franchise drive ins which were acquired by the company effective september the following table provides information regarding the number of partner drive ins and franchise drive ins in operation as of the end of the periods indicated as well as the system wide growth in sales and average unit volume 
system wide information includes both partner drive in and franchise drive in information  which we believe is useful in analyzing the growth of the brand as well as the company s revenues since franchisees pay royalties based on a percentage of sales 
system wide performance in thousands year ended august  percentage increase in sales system wide drive ins in operation total at beginning of period opened closed net of re openings total at end of period core markets developing markets all markets average sales per drive in core markets developing markets all markets change in same store sales core markets developing markets all markets represents percentage change for drive ins open for a minimum of months 
system wide same store sales increased during fiscal year  largely as a result of traffic growth an increase in the number of transactions across all day parts eg morning  lunch  afternoon  dinner  and evening 
additionally  a lesser portion of the growth came from an increase in the average check the average amount spent per transaction 
this marked our th consecutive year of positive same store sales 
we believe our strong sales performance is a direct consequence of our specific sales driving initiatives including  but not limited to growth in brand awareness through increased media spending and greater use of network cable advertising  strong promotions and new product news focused on quality and expanded choices for our customers  continued growth of our business in non traditional day parts including the morning  afternoon  and evening day parts  which saw solid increases in sales  and use of technology to reach customers and improve the customer experience 
during fiscal year  our total system wide media expenditures were approximately million as compared to million in fiscal year  which we believe continues to increase overall brand awareness and strengthen our share of voice relative to our competitors 
we have also shifted more of our marketing dollars to our system wide marketing fund efforts  which are largely used for network cable television advertising  growing this area of our advertising from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year we believe increased network cable advertising provides several benefits including the ability to more effectively target and better reach the cable audience  which has now surpassed broadcast networks in terms of viewership 
in addition  national cable advertising also allows us to bring additional depth to our media and expand our message beyond our traditional emphasis on a single monthly promotion 
looking forward  we expect system wide media expenditures to be approximately million in fiscal the system wide marketing fund portion will again represent approximately one half of total media expenditures for fiscal we continue to use our monthly promotions to highlight our distinctive food offerings and to feature new products 
we also use our promotions and product news to create a strong emotional link with consumers and to align closely with consumer trends for fresh ingredients  customization  menu variety and choice 
during the past year  our new product offerings showcased the breadth of our menu and emphasized the opportunity for choice at sonic 
we will continue to have new product news in the coming months  all designed to meet customers evolving taste preferences including the growing desire for fresh  quality product offerings and healthier alternatives 
we continue to promote the expansion of our business in non traditional day parts morning  afternoon  and evening 
the momentum in our evening business  which rose significantly with the return of our sonic nights initiative in the summer of fiscal year  continued through fiscal year every day part  including lunch and dinner  showed positive growth during fiscal year compared to fiscal year  and we believe we have continuing opportunity to grow our non traditional day parts like afternoon and evening throughout fiscal year implementation of the pays program  which began in the fall of  was completed in the remainder of our partner drive ins during the second quarter of fiscal year under the pays program  a credit card terminal is added to each drive in stall to facilitate credit and debit card transactions 
rollout to franchise drive ins began in february and is expected to be completed system wide by the end of calendar year the average investment to install pays in a typical sonic drive in is approximately thousand 
in evaluating this initiative  we have targeted an increased sales to investment ratio of to  and it has been our experience that the installation of the pays program has generally met and often exceeds this target 
a highlight of fiscal year was reaching the million mark for system wide average unit volumes 
another positive trend that has continued for seven consecutive quarters is the performance of developing markets relative to core markets 
system wide same store sales in developing markets outpaced same store sales in core markets  increasing during fiscal year on top of a increase in fiscal year we believe this increase was primarily due to additional spending on national cable  which has benefited all of our markets  and particularly our developing markets 
from an average unit volume standpoint  developing markets  which represent roughly of the store base  increased continuing the positive trend of the last year and well ahead of the average unit volume increase in core markets which increased 
another milestone reached during fiscal year was the opening of sonic s  th drive in 
we opened new drive ins during fiscal year  consisting of partner drive ins and franchise drive ins  down slightly from drive in openings during fiscal year partner drive ins and franchise drive ins 
looking forward  the company expects to open to new drive ins during fiscal year  including to by franchisees 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal year from million during fiscal year the increase in revenues primarily relates to strong sales growth for partner drive ins and  to a lesser extent  a rise in franchising income 
revenues in thousands percent increase increase year ended august  decrease decrease revenues partner drive in sales franchise revenues franchise royalties franchise fees other total revenues percent increase increase year ended august  decrease decrease revenues partner drive in sales franchise revenues franchise royalties franchise fees other total revenues the following table reflects the growth in partner drive in sales and changes in comparable drive in sales for partner drive ins 
it also presents information about average unit volumes and the number of partner drive ins  which is useful in analyzing the growth of partner drive in sales 
partner drive in sales in thousands year ended august  partner drive in sales percentage increase partner drive ins in operation total at beginning of period opened acquired from sold to franchisees  net closed total at end of period average sales per partner drive in percentage increase change in same store sales represents percentage change for drive ins open for a minimum of months 
the increases in partner drive in sales result from newly constructed and acquired drive ins and same store sales increases in existing drive ins  offset by the loss of sales for sold and closed drive ins 
change in partner drive in sales in thousands year ended august  increase from addition of newly constructed drive ins increase from acquisition of drive ins increase from same store sales decrease from drive ins sold or closed net increase in partner drive in sales represents the increase for and drive ins opened since the beginning of the prior fiscal year as of august  and  respectively 
represents the increase for and drive ins acquired since the beginning of the prior fiscal year as of august  and  respectively 
represents the decrease for and drive ins sold or closed since the beginning of the prior fiscal year as of august  and  respectively 
during fiscal year  same store sales at partner drive ins again exceeded the same store sales performance of our franchisees 
the increase in average unit volume was also strong growing during the year as a result of the acquisition of higher volume drive ins in colorado in july as well as strong performance from new stores 
effective july   we rolled over the acquisition of the colorado drive ins which accounted for approximately three percentage points of the growth in partner drive in sales during fiscal year beginning in fiscal year  we implemented initiatives designed to close the approximately thousand sales gap in annual average unit volumes between partner drive ins and franchise drive ins 
to a large degree  this effort is modeled on the best practices of our top volume partner and franchise drive ins 
our intent is to complement the strong profit motive created through our partnership program with strong incentives focused on top line growth 
during fiscal year  this gap narrowed by or approximately thousand per drive in 
during fiscal year  the trend continued as same store sales growth at partner drive ins outpaced same store sales of franchise drive ins  closing the gap by another thousand 
over the past several years  we have completed the acquisition of several franchise drive ins in various markets including the acquisition of drive ins located in the san antonio  texas market in may and the acquisition of drive ins located in the denver and colorado springs  colorado markets in july effective september   we acquired franchise drive ins located in the tennessee and kentucky markets 
these acquisitions have added and are expected to continue to add to revenue growth and are expected to continue to be accretive to earnings over time 
our acquisitions are focused on higher volume stores with strong store level management already in place 
in addition  the selling franchisee usually retains a significant drive in base and continues growing with us in other areas 
we view these types of acquisitions of drive ins with proven track records as a very good  lower risk use of our capital and they remain a very viable potential use of our excess cash flow in future years 
the following table reflects the growth in franchise revenues franchise royalties and franchise fees as well as franchise sales  average unit volumes and the number of franchise drive ins 
while we do not record franchise drive in sales as revenues  we believe this information is important in understanding our financial performance since these sales are the basis on which we calculate and record franchise royalties 
this information is also indicative of the financial performance of our franchise drive ins 
franchise information in thousands year ended august  franchise fees and royalties percentage increase franchise drive ins in operation total at beginning of period opened acquired from sold to company  net closed total at end of period franchise drive in sales percentage increase effective royalty rate average sales per franchise drive in change in same store sales see revenue recognition related to franchise fees and royalties in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of md a

franchise income  which consists of franchise royalties and franchise fees  increased to million in fiscal year franchise royalties increased to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year of the million increase  approximately million resulted from franchise drive ins same store sales growth of in fiscal year  combined with an increase in the effective royalty rate to during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year each of our license agreements contains an ascending royalty rate whereby royalties  as a percentage of sales  increase as sales increase 
the balance of the increase was attributable to growth in the number of franchise drive ins over the prior period 
franchise royalties increased to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year of the million increase  approximately million resulted from franchise drive ins same store sales growth of in fiscal year  combined with an increase in the effective royalty rate to during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year the balance of the increase was attributable to growth in the number of franchise drive ins over the prior period 
franchise fees decreased to million as franchisees opened new drive ins in fiscal year as compared to openings in fiscal year franchise fees increased to million during fiscal as franchise drive ins opened compared to during the previous year 
during fiscal year  development on the franchise side was negatively impacted by a number of factors 
we had numerous projects affected by various delays caused by zoning and permitting difficulties as well as site specific location and construction issues 
we believe this is a direct by product of a more challenging development environment as much of our development is occurring in harder to develop markets  including florida and california 
in addition  since the development cycle tends to be to months long  we are  to some degree  feeling the impact of a slowdown in store profitability during that tends to create a more cautious approach to development from franchisees 
looking forward  there has been a strong rise in per store profits over the last months that has positively impacted the pipeline for future franchise development 
this is evidenced by area development agreements at the end of fiscal year representing approximately planned franchise drive in openings over the next few years  compared to such agreements at august  which represented approximately planned franchise drive in openings 
another step that has contributed to growth in the franchise pipeline is the recent planned expansion into a number of new markets  primarily located along the east and west coasts 
in the past  our market expansion has been limited to a fewer number of markets at one time  we believe the brand awareness provided by our national cable advertising efforts will support this planned expansion to a greater number of markets 
twenty franchise drive ins were closed during fiscal year  which was an increase from the nine franchise drive ins closed during fiscal year fifteen of the closings occurred during the second quarter and related primarily to two weaker franchise operators in two different markets 
we do not believe that these drive in closings are indicative of the sonic brand s success 
we have taken steps to require stronger financial qualifications of new franchisees  which we believe will significantly mitigate this type of risk 
in addition  we expect that some of these drive ins may re open under new franchisee ownership 
we anticipate to store openings by franchisees during fiscal year substantially all of these new drive ins will open under our newest form of license agreement  which contains a higher average royalty rate and initial opening fee 
as a result of these new franchise drive in openings and the continued benefit of the ascending royalty rate  we expect approximately million in incremental franchise fees and royalties in fiscal year operating expenses 
overall  drive in cost of operations  as a percentage of partner drive in sales  increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year minority interest in earnings of drive ins is included as a part of cost of sales  in the table below  since it is directly related to partner drive in operations 
operating margins year ended august  costs and expenses partner drive ins food and packaging payroll and other employee benefits minority interest in earnings of partner drive ins other operating expenses total partner drive in cost of operations as a percentage of partner drive in sales 
food and packaging costs decreased by percentage points during fiscal year compared to fiscal year following an increase of percentage points during fiscal year compared to fiscal year in the early part of the year  we experienced significant  year over year increases in several commodities including beef  dairy  and tomatoes 
they were offset by menu price increases of approximately in december and in may  as well as abatement of price pressures for these items  particularly dairy  in the latter part of the year 
looking forward  we anticipate that slightly lower year over year costs for beef  as well as lower costs for other items will result in lower food and packaging costs  as a percentage of sales  on a year over year basis in fiscal year this favorable outlook may be negatively impacted if energy prices remain high throughout the year 
labor costs increased by percentage points during fiscal year compared to fiscal year after an increase of percentage points during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the slight increase for fiscal year resulted from staffing increases at the assistant manager level  as well as higher labor costs related to opening newly constructed stores as higher staffing levels were required for pre opening training and through the initial opening period 
the increase was primarily a result of significant payments made under the sales based incentive program for drive in management as well as higher staffing levels reflecting successful ongoing efforts to reduce turnover at partner drive ins 
looking forward  the average wage rate has increased slightly in the last two quarters of fiscal year  although the increase has not been significant to date 
we plan to continue making significant payments under our sales incentive program  as we believe it has been a major driver of strong sales performance at partner drive ins 
these increases  however  should be leveraged by higher volumes 
as a result  we expect labor costs to be flat to slightly favorable  as a percentage of sales  on a year over year basis  in fiscal year minority interest  which reflects our store level partners pro rata share of earnings from our partnership program  increased by million during fiscal year  reflecting the increase in average profit per store 
during fiscal year  minority interest increased million  also reflecting the increase in average profit per store 
overall  we continue to view the partnership program as an integral part of our culture at sonic and a large factor in the success of our business  and we are pleased that profit distributions to our partners increased during fiscal year since we expect our average store level profits to continue to grow in fiscal year  we would expect minority interest to increase in dollar terms but stay relatively flat as a percentage of sales 
other operating expenses increased by percentage points during fiscal year costs increased primarily as a result of credit card charges associated with the increase in credit card transactions stemming from the success of the pays program  as well as increased repairs and maintenance expenses resulting from a greater focus on the physical appearance of our drive ins  both inside and outside 
utility costs also increased toward the end of fiscal year as a result of increased energy prices 
during fiscal year  other operating expenses decreased by percentage points as the leverage of operating at higher unit volumes more than offset increased costs 
looking forward  we expect cost increases in many of the items listed above  particularly utility costs  to carry over into fiscal year our expectations for other operating costs will continue to depend upon future swings in energy costs  but we generally expect that the cost increases will result in other operating expenses increasing to percentage points  in fiscal year to summarize  we are expecting overall restaurant level margins to be relatively flat during fiscal year on a year over year basis  depending upon the variability in energy costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million during fiscal year and to million during fiscal year we continue to see leverage as the growth in these expenses was considerably less than the growth in revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal year  compared with in fiscal year and in fiscal year beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company will adopt fas r which requires the fair value of stock options be charged to expense 
the projected impact of adopting this standard is estimated to be additional expense of approximately to million during fiscal year this expense is expected to be incurred pro rata over the fiscal year  with the amount increasing slightly in the third and fourth quarters due to the annual grant of options that typically occurs at sonic s spring board meeting 
excluding the impact of fas r  we anticipate that these costs will increase in the range of to in fiscal year and to decline as a percentage of sales 
this rate of increase is higher than prior years primarily because of increased headcount additions which management believes is necessary to support continued growth in our business 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal year due  in part  to additional depreciation stemming from the colorado acquisition in july similarly  depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal year as a result of the san antonio and colorado acquisitions  as well as the capital lease on our corporate office space 
capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million in fiscal year looking forward  with approximately to million in capital expenditures planned for the year  normal depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by approximately to for the year 
however  the company re evaluated the remaining asset life of certain assets related to the retrofit of partner drive ins in the late s and has determined that the remaining useful life should be reduced 
this reduction will cause an incremental increase in depreciation and amortization over the next four quarters of approximately over the prior year  resulting in an overall expectation that depreciation and amortization will increase in the range of to for the year 
provision for impairment of long lived assets 
one partner drive in and one property held for disposal became impaired during fiscal year under the guidelines of fas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  a total provision for impairment of long lived assets of million was recorded for the carrying costs of these assets in excess of their estimated fair values 
one partner drive in became impaired during fiscal year which resulted in a provision for impairment of million to reduce the drive in s carrying cost to its estimated fair value 
during fiscal year  two partner drive ins became impaired which resulted in a provision for impairment totaling million to reduce the drive ins carrying cost to their estimated fair value 
we continue to perform quarterly analyses of certain underperforming drive ins 
it is reasonably possible that the estimate of future cash flows associated with these drive ins may change in the near future resulting in the need to write down assets associated with one or more of these drive ins to fair value 
while it is impossible to predict if future write downs will occur  we do not believe that future write downs will impede our ability to continue growing earnings at a solid rate 
interest expense 
net interest expense decreased in fiscal year compared to a increase in fiscal year as a result of strong cash flow from operations 
the reduction in interest expense more than offset the decrease in interest income relating to the outsourcing of our partner notes to a third party financial institution in august interest expense increased in fiscal year largely due to the addition of the capital lease associated with our new office space 
our ability to generate positive operating cash flow enabled us to expend million in capital expenditures  million in share repurchases and still reduce our long term debt by million 
going forward  we expect our continued repurchase of stock  as well as the acquisition of drive ins effective september  will produce higher interest expense in future quarters depending on the level of shares repurchased or additional franchise acquisitions 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes reflects an effective federal and state tax rate of for fiscal year compared with in fiscal year and in fiscal year the lower rate for fiscal year resulted primarily from a retroactive tax law change that reinstated expired tax credits in the first quarter of fiscal year the reduction in our effective tax rate in fiscal year was primarily a result of the benefit of higher tax credits 
we expect the adoption of fas r for stock options in the first quarter of fiscal year to impact the tax rate  as only the portion of stock option expense expected to result in a future tax deduction is considered deductible for tax accounting purposes 
sonic currently estimates the tax benefit for stock options to be approximately of the amount expensed 
considering these variables  we anticipate that our effective tax rate will increase during fiscal year to a range of to and vary from quarter to quarter as circumstances on individual tax matters change 
financial position during fiscal year  current assets increased to million compared to million as of the end of fiscal year net property  equipment and capital leases increased by as a result of capital expenditures 
the increases in current assets and net property  equipment and capital leases were partially offset by decreases in notes receivable  resulting from early repayment by franchisees  to produce an increase in total assets to million as of the end of fiscal year total current liabilities increased million or during fiscal year as a result of increases in income taxes payable and trade payables 
the non current portion of long term debt decreased million or as a result of repayment of debt using cash generated from operating activities 
overall  total liabilities decreased million or as a result of the items discussed above 
stockholders equity increased million or during fiscal year primarily resulting from earnings during the period of million offset by treasury stock repurchases of million 
proceeds and the related tax benefit from the exercise of stock options accounted for the balance of the increase 
at the end of fiscal year  our debt to total capital ratio stood at  down from at the end of fiscal year for the twelve months ended august   return on average stockholders equity was and return on average assets was 
liquidity and sources of capital net cash provided by operating activities increased million or to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of an increase in operating profit before depreciation and amortization and an increase in operating liabilities related to the amount and timing of tax and other liability payments 
we also anticipate continuing to generate increasing positive free cash flow going forward 
we believe free cash flow  which we define as net income plus depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense less capital expenditures  is useful in evaluating the liquidity of the company by assessing the level of funds available for share repurchases  acquisitions of franchise drive ins  and repayment of debt 
we expect free cash flow to approach million for fiscal year we have an agreement with a group of banks that provides us with a million line of credit expiring in july as of august   our outstanding borrowings under the line of credit were million at an effective borrowing rate of  as well as million in outstanding letters of credit 
the amount available under the line of credit as of august   was million 
we have long term debt maturing in fiscal year of million 
of this amount  million relates to our senior unsecured notes that will be maturing in august  and is classified as long term because we intend to utilize amounts available under our line of credit to fund this obligation 
we believe that free cash flow will be adequate for repayment of any long term debt that does not get refinanced or extended 
we plan to use the line of credit to finance the opening of newly constructed drive ins and other planned capital expenditures  acquisitions of existing drive ins  purchases of the company s common stock and for other general corporate purposes  as needed 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long term debt 
on april   our board of directors approved an increase in the amount available under our share repurchase program from million to million and extended the program through august  pursuant to this program  the company acquired million shares at an average price of for a total cost of million during fiscal year as of august   we had million available under the program 
we opened newly constructed partner drive ins and sold a net of one drive in to franchisees during fiscal year we funded total capital additions for fiscal year of million  which included the cost of newly opened drive ins  new equipment for existing drive ins  drive ins under construction  the acquisition of franchise drive ins  and other capital expenditures  from cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under our line of credit 
during fiscal year  we purchased the real estate for of the newly constructed and acquired drive ins 
sales of real estate relating to drive ins previously sold to franchisees are a component of cash from investing activities and totaled million during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year subsequent to august   the company acquired franchise drive ins for million  excluding any post closing adjustments 
the company also continued to repurchase shares of stock under the share repurchase program  purchasing an additional million shares for million 
the total remaining amount authorized for repurchase as of november  was million 
these cash outlays also led to additional advances under the available line of credit  with the total amount outstanding at november  of million  an increase of million over the balance at august  we plan capital expenditures of approximately to million in fiscal year  excluding potential acquisitions and share repurchases 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to the development of additional partner drive ins  stall additions  relocations of older drive ins  store equipment and point of sale system upgrades  and enhancements to existing financial and operating information systems 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our existing line of credit 
as of august   our total cash balance of million reflected the impact of the cash generated from operating activities  borrowing activity  and capital expenditures mentioned above 
we believe that existing cash and funds generated from operations  as well as borrowings under the line of credit  will meet our needs for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has obligations for guarantees on certain franchisee loans and lease agreements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about these guarantees 
the company has no other off balance sheet financings 
contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  sonic enters into purchase contracts  lease agreements and borrowing arrangements 
our commitments and obligations as of august  are summarized in the following table payments due by period in thousands total less than more than year years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital leases operating leases total impact of inflation though increases in labor  food or other operating costs could adversely affect our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
seasonality we do not expect seasonality to affect our operations in a materially adverse manner 
our results during the second fiscal quarter the months of december  january and february generally are lower than other quarters because of the climate of the locations of a number of partner and franchise drive ins 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in this document contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use its judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be relevant under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we annually review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of risk  judgment and or complexity 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review each partner drive in for impairment when events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
we test for impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
in addition  at least annually  we assess the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our brand and drive ins 
these impairment tests require us to estimate fair values of our brand and our drive ins by making assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
ownership program 
our drive in philosophy stresses an ownership relationship with supervisors and drive in managers 
most supervisors and managers of partner drive ins own an equity interest in the drive in  which was previously financed by the company 
we outsourced the financing of partner notes to a third party in the fourth fiscal quarter of supervisors and managers are neither employees of sonic nor of the drive in in which they have an ownership interest 
the investments made by managers and supervisors in each partnership or limited liability company are accounted for as minority interests in the financial statements 
the ownership agreements contain provisions  which give sonic the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the minority interest of the supervisor or manager in a drive in 
the amount of the investment made by a partner and the amount of the buy out are based on a number of factors  primarily upon the drive in s financial performance for the preceding months  and are intended to approximate the fair value of a minority interest in the drive in 
the net book value of a minority interest acquired by the company in a partner drive in is recorded as an investment in partnership  which results in a reduction in the minority interest liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
if the purchase price exceeds the net book value of the assets underlying the partnership interest  the excess is recorded as goodwill 
the acquisition of a minority interest for less than book value results in a decrease in purchased goodwill 
any subsequent sale of the minority interest to another minority partner is recorded as a pro rata reduction of goodwill and investment  and no gain or loss is recognized on the sale of the minority ownership interest 
goodwill created as a result of the acquisition of minority interests in partner drive ins is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment under the provisions of fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
revenue recognition related to franchise fees and royalties 
initial franchise fees are nonrefundable and are recognized in income when we have substantially performed or satisfied all material services or conditions relating to the sale of the franchise 
area development fees are nonrefundable and are recognized in income on a pro rata basis when the conditions for revenue recognition under the individual development agreements are met 
both initial franchise fees and area development fees are generally recognized upon the opening of a franchise drive in or upon termination of the agreement between sonic and the franchisee 
our franchisees are required under the provisions of the license agreements to pay royalties to sonic each month based on a percentage of actual net sales 
however  the royalty payments and supporting financial statements are not due until the th of the following month 
as a result  we accrue royalty revenue in the month earned based on estimates of franchise drive ins sales 
these estimates are based on actual sales at partner drive ins and projections of average unit volume growth at franchise drive ins 
income taxes 
we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
these estimates include  among other items  depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  allowable tax credits for items such as wages paid to certain employees  effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision  including legislative and judicial developments 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state and local governments  typically several years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
adjustments to these estimates or returns can result in significant variability in the tax rate from period to period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and notes receivable  as well as changes in commodity prices 
our exposure to interest rate risk currently consists of our senior notes  outstanding line of credit  and notes receivable 
the senior notes bear interest at fixed rates which average 
the aggregate balance outstanding under the senior notes as of august  was million 
should interest rates increase or decrease  the estimated fair value of these notes would decrease or increase  respectively 
as of august   the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by approximately million 
the line of credit bears interest at a rate benchmarked to us and european short term interest rates 
the balance outstanding under the line of credit was million as of august  the impact on our results of operations of a one point interest rate change on the average outstanding balance under the line of credit during fiscal year would be approximately million 
we have made certain loans to our franchisees totaling million as of august  the interest rates on these notes are generally between and 
we believe the fair market value of these notes approximates their carrying amount 
the company and its franchisees purchase certain commodities such as beef  potatoes  chicken and dairy products 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing price floors or caps  however  we have not made any long term commitments to purchase any minimum quantities under these arrangements 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase agreements help control the ultimate cost and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in financial markets
