item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate two distinct segments  the electrical and industrial products segment and the galvanizing services segment 
the electrical and industrial products segment serves the power generation  transmission and distribution markets as well as the general industrial market 
the galvanizing services segment consists of eleven hot dip galvanizing facilities located throughout the south and southwest united states that provides galvanizing service to the steel fabrication industry 
for the fiscal year ended february   we recorded revenues of million compared to the prior year s revenues of million 
approximately of our revenues were generated from the electrical and industrial products segment and approximately were generated from the galvanizing services segment 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million in the fiscal net income as a percentage of sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal earnings per share increased by to 
per share for fiscal compared to 
per share in fiscal  on a diluted basis 
results of operations year ended february  compared with year ended february  management believes that analyzing our revenue and operating income by segment is the most meaningful analysis of our results of operations 
segment operating income consists of net sales less cost of sales  specifically identifiable selling  general and administrative expenses  and other income expense items that are specifically identifiable to a segment 
the other income expense items included in segment operating income are generally insignificant 
for a reconciliation of segment operating income to pretax income  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues the following table reflects the breakdown of revenue by segment in thousands revenue electrical and industrial products galvanizing services total revenue our consolidated net revenues for fiscal increased by million or  as compared to fiscal the electrical and industrial products segment produces highly engineered specialty products supplied to the power generation  power transmission  power distribution and general industrial markets as well as lighting and tubular products to the industrial and petroleum markets 
the segment recorded revenues for fiscal of million  an increase of above the fiscal results of million 
the increased revenue resulted primarily from increased demand for our products in the power distribution and petroleum markets 
while these markets showed improvement  the revenue contribution from the industrial market was below expectations due to extreme pricing pressure that caused us to decline certain projects due to unacceptable pricing levels 
we believe that market indicators and quotation levels continue to suggest that our markets have stabilized and in some areas showed improvement 
we continue to see a higher level of international quotations  particularly in our power generation and high voltage transmission products 
the electrical and industrial products segment ended fiscal with a backlog of million  an increase of as compared to fiscal backlog of million 
the segment recorded a book to ship ratio

index to financial statements of to for fiscal as compared to to in the prior year 
in fiscal  we continued our efforts to improve our market coverage and expand our served markets 
competition in the segment remains intense due to the imbalance between supply and demand  and we continue to see aggressive price initiatives from our competitors 
our concern going into fiscal is whether we will see a slowdown in the domestic economy and that competitors will continue to strive to maintain market share and increase capacity utilization using price as the primary vehicle 
the following table reflects bookings and shipments for fiscal and backlog table in thousands period ending period ending backlog bookings shipments backlog book to ship ratio our galvanizing services segment  which is made up of eleven hot dip galvanizing facilities  generated revenues of million  a increase from the prior year s revenues of million 
the increased revenue resulted from a slight improvement in pricing and an increase in the pounds of steel produced in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in volume was due to the improved geographical markets in which our facilities are located and the resurgence of galvanizing for the telecommunication markets 
revenues for this segment have historically followed the condition of the general industrial economy 
any sustained improvement of the general industrial economy should produce improved results for this segment 
segment operating income the following table reflects the breakdown of total operating income by segment in thousands segment operating income electrical and industrial products galvanizing services total segment operating income our consolidated operating income see note to notes to consolidated financial statements increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal consolidated operating margins as a percentage of sales were consistent for the compared periods at 
we continue to place emphasis on systems and procedures and the sharing of best practices among our operations to further enhance operating efficiency 
we are in the process of implementing oracle s enterprise resource planning erp system which should provide numerous efficiencies once the conversion is completed in fiscal the electrical and industrial products segment generated of the operating income for fiscal  while the galvanizing services segment produced the remaining 
operating income for the electrical and industrial products segment increased  or for fiscal  to million as compared to million for fiscal operating margins for this segment were unchanged at for the compared periods 
operating efficiencies and leverage obtained from increased revenues during fiscal were offset by increased material costs  primarily copper  aluminum  and steel 
as result of competitive pricing pressure in this segment s markets  we were unable to recoup these costs through price increases to our customers 
we continue to align and consolidate resources to match current market conditions  while still maintaining its ability to capitalize on opportunities that arise 
despite improved market conditions  we believe that we will continue to see very competitive pricing in fiscal due to excess capacity 

table of contents 
index to financial statements operating income for the galvanizing service segment increased  or for fiscal  to million as compared to million for the prior year 
the operating income improvement is attributable to a increase in revenues 
this segment continues to benefit from the sizing of its operations to match market conditions 
operating margins were consistent at for fiscal and the additional margin obtained from the resizing of the organization and the leverage achieved from increased revenue were offset by the increased commodity cost of zinc 
the recent metal commodity pricing  including the cost of zinc  continues to be a concern 
the increase in zinc costs could have a significant impact on margins if economic factors inhibit our ability to pass this increased cost on to our customers 
it is difficult to determine at this time what the overall customer reaction will be to our attempted recovery of the increased cost of zinc 
the increasing cost of zinc is a critical factor that impacts all participants in the hot dip galvanizing business 
general corporate expense general corporate expenses were million for fiscal and million for fiscal as a percentage of sales  general corporate expenses were for fiscal as compared to in fiscal the percentage increase results in part from implementation cost of oracle s erp system that could not be capitalized and sarbanes oxley compliance cost  which combined totaled  for fiscal interest expense for fiscal was million  a decrease of as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense resulted from significant reductions of our average outstanding debt throughout fiscal our total outstanding bank debt of million at the end of was million less than the million outstanding at the end of fiscal our long term debt to equity ratio improved to

fiscal included the amount of  for gain on the sale of vacant land  which was not specifically identifiable to a segment 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax resulted from a difference in the mix of profits generated from our operating facilities located in varying tax jurisdictions  which impacted our effective tax rate for current and deferred taxes

the reduced revenues result primarily from 
table of contents 
index to financial statements lower demand from the domestic power generation market in fiscal as compared to fiscal during this period  this segment worked through the backlog that was related to the domestic power generation projects 
in addition to the lack of new domestic power generation projects  the low capital spending levels in the industrial market in fiscal had a negative impact on this segment s revenues 
we continued in fiscal to intensify our efforts to increase our presence in international markets and improve our position in industrial and utility markets through improvements in this segment s distribution networks 
as a result of the increased efforts in the international market  a co branding and co operative agreement with jiangsu changjiang electric group co  ltd 
of china was signed in fiscal the electrical and industrial products segment ended fiscal with a backlog of million  an increase of as compared to fiscal backlog of million 
the backlog continued to be heavily weighted towards the distribution market in fiscal the backlog was aided by bookings for this segment s high voltage bus duct product during fiscal the following table reflects bookings and shipments for the compared periods of fiscal and backlog table in thousands period ending period ending backlog bookings shipments backlog book to ship ratio our galvanizing services segment generated revenues of million  a decrease from the prior year s revenues of million 
the decline in revenue for fiscal was created by the increase in steel prices during the fourth quarter  which impacted many of our steel fabrication customers and delayed some scheduled projects 
due to this segment s broad customer base  and multiple locations  we were able to minimize the impact of the increased steel prices on segment operations

the decline in operating income and margins was the direct result of lower revenues  primarily in the electrical and industrial products segment  as well as intense competition in both of our segments 
we resized our operations in both operating segments to reflect the extremely competitive conditions facing each

operating income for the electrical and industrial products segment declined million or for fiscal  to million as compared to million for fiscal operating margins for this segment declined 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to for the current year as compared to for fiscal the operating profits and margins were significantly impacted by a reductions in revenues coupled with continued price competition within the markets in which these products are sold 
while we continued to implement operational efficiencies and cost reductions we could not offset the dramatic reductions in revenues 
operating income for the galvanizing service segment declined  or for fiscal  to million as compared to million for the prior year 
operating margins were consistent at for the compared periods of fiscal and the operating income decline is attributable to a slight reduction in revenues and increased cost for natural gas 
general corporate expense general corporate expenses were million for fiscal and fiscal as a percentage of sales  general corporate expenses were for fiscal as compared to in fiscal the percentage increase results from a reduction in revenues for fiscal interest expense for fiscal was million  a decrease of as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense resulted from significant reductions of outstanding debt and record low interest rates on our variable debt instruments

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal and liquidity and capital resources we have historically met cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and bank borrowings 
our cash requirements are generally for operating activities  capital improvements  debt repayment and acquisitions 
we believe that working capital  borrowing capabilities  and funds generated from operations should be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities  capital improvements  debt repayment and possible future acquisitions 
our operating activities generated cash flows of approximately million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively 
cash flow from operations in fiscal included net income in the amount of million  depreciation and amortization of intangibles and debt issue costs in the amount of million  and net changes in operating assets and liabilities and other increases in cash flows from operations of a negative million 
due to increased business levels in both our segments  our working capital requirements were increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the increased levels of business accounts receivable  inventories  revenues in excess of billings  and prepaid and other assets balances increased by million  million  million  and  respectively in fiscal over accounts receivable days outstanding for fiscal were days as compared to days in fiscal inventory turns were times for fiscal as compared to times in fiscal the decrease in cash flow from increases in accounts receivable  inventories  and revenue in excess of billings was partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued

increases in cash flows from changes in deferred tax liabilities  provision for bad debt  and other non cash transactions accounted for the remaining million net change in operating assets and liabilities 
during fiscal  cash flow from operations was used to make capital improvements of million and to reduce debt by million 
the breakdown of capital spending by segment for fiscal   and can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began the implementation of a new erp system  which is scheduled for completion in fiscal the capital expenditures in fiscal were million for the erp system as compared with  for fiscal  and it is estimated that additional capital outlay of approximately  will be incurred in fiscal to complete the implementation 
we received proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and proceeds from the exercise of stock options in the total amount of  there were no cash dividends declared or paid in fiscal  and no resumption of a cash dividend is currently anticipated 
on november   we entered into an amended and restated revolving and term loan credit agreement the credit agreement  which replaced the previous term notes and revolving line of credit 
the new agreement included a million term facility and a million revolving credit facility 
since november   the company amended the credit agreement to reduce the number of banks participating from five to three banks  reduce the company s revolving credit facility from million to million  extend the maturity of the revolving line of credit to june   extend the maturity and amortization of the term facility to march   and revise the provisions of various financial covenants 
these financial covenants consist of minimum consolidated net worth maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
as of february   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
the availability under the revolving credit facility is contingent on asset based collateral of inventories and accounts receivable 
at february   we had million outstanding under the term note and million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the remaining balance outstanding on the term loan is payable in quarterly installments of million through march at february   we had approximately million of additional credit available under our revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the term note and revolving line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of the base rate plus the applicable margin for the base rate borrowings for the applicable facility  or the adjusted eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin for eurodollar rate borrowings for the applicable facility 
the applicable margin is based on the leverage ratio  which was at february   and correlated to an interest rate of on the hedged portion of the note and on the variable portion of the note at february  additionally  we are obligated to pay a commitment fee based on the leverage ratio at a rate ranging from 
to 
on the unused revolving credit facility we use interest rate protection agreements to moderate the effects of increases  if any  in interest rates by swapping debt from a variable rate to a fixed rate 
as of february  we have two outstanding interest rate swaps 
under the first swap agreement the swap agreement which matures in february  we pay a fixed rate of in exchange for a variable day libor rate plus at february  
the notional amount of the swap was originally designed to correspond to the maturities of our term debt that was outstanding in  and at february   the remaining notional amount was million 
prior to november  this swap was treated as a cash flow hedge of our variable interest rate exposure 
however  we refinanced our credit agreement in november and chose to cease the hedge designation for the swap agreement while keeping it in effect 
since that time  we have been recognizing changes in the fair value of this swap directly in earnings  while amortizing the pretax amount included in accumulated other comprehensive income as additional interest expense 
for the fiscal years and  we amortized  as additional interest expense for each year and recognized mark to market gains of  and  respectively  for subsequent changes in the fair value of this swap 
at february   the fair value of the swap agreement was a liability of  and a loss of  net of tax  remains in accumulated other comprehensive income to be amortized as additional interest expense

index to financial statements in conjunction with our debt refinancing in november  we entered into a new interest rate swap the swap agreement as a cash flow hedge of our variable interest expense related to the term note 
under the swap agreement we exchanged interest rate obligations from november through november  of a fixed rate of for a variable day libor rate plus at february  
the notional amount of this swap matures in stages and as of february   the remaining notional amount was million and the swap matures in november to date there has been no ineffectiveness related to the swap agreement 
at february   the fair value of the swap agreement was a liability of  and a loss of  net of tax  is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
given the maturity dates of the interest rate swaps  all amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to flow through earnings by the end of fiscal subsequent to february   we entered into a new interest rate protection agreement the swap agreement as a cash flow hedge of the variable interest expense related to the term note 
under the swap agreement we exchange interest rate obligations from march  through march  whereby we pay a fixed rate of for a variable day libor plus at march

long term debt as a percentage of shareholders equity was at the end of fiscal as compared to at the end of fiscal the decrease in long term debt as a percentage of shareholders equity was the result of a reduction in debt of million and increased shareholders equity of million 
the funds used for debt repayment came from cash flows generated from operations 
we have not experienced significant impacts on our operations from increases in general inflation other than for specific commodities and employee health care costs 
we have exposure to commodity price increases in both segments of our business  primarily zinc in the galvanizing services segment and copper  aluminum and steel in the electrical and industrial products segment 
we attempt to minimize these increases through protective caps purchased on zinc and escalation clauses in customer contracts for copper  aluminum and steel  when market conditions allow 
in addition to these measures  we attempt to recover other cost increases through improvements to our manufacturing process and through increases in prices where competitively feasible 
off balance sheet transactions and related matters there are no off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations  or other relationships of the company with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have  or may have  a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

for further information regarding our long term debt obligations and interest rate protection agreements see liquidity and capital resources above and footnote of the notes to the consolidated financial statements found on page maturities of long term debt and the related interest  which are based on rates as of february   are summarized in the above table 
at november   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million 
these letters of credit are issued to some customers to cover any potential warranty costs that the customer might incur 
in addition  as of february   a warranty reserve in the amount of million has been established to offset any future warranty claims 
leases we lease various facilities under non cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year 
the future minimum payments required under these operating leases as of february  are summarized in the above table 
rental expense for real estate and personal property was approximately   and  for fiscal years ended  and  respectively  and includes all short term as well as long term rental agreements 
commodity pricing we manage our exposure to commodity prices in both of our business segments 
in the galvanizing services segment  we utilize agreements with zinc suppliers that include protective caps 
these agreements typically are negotiated in december of each year and normally are for a twelve month period of time 
we also secure firm pricing for natural gas supplies with individual utilities when possible 
there are no contracted volume purchase commitments associated with the zinc or natural gas agreements 
management believes these agreements ensure adequate supplies and partially offset exposure to commodity price swings 
in the electrical and industrial products segment  we have exposure to commodity pricing for copper  aluminum  and steel 
because the electrical and industrial products segment does not commit contractually to minimum volumes  increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses in our customer s contracts  although during difficult market conditions these escalation clauses may not be readily obtainable 
we do not have contracted purchase commitments for any other commodity items including steel  aluminum  natural gas  zinc  or copper or other commodities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported value of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe reasonable under the circumstances  and form the basis for our conclusions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as business and economic conditions change 
accounting policies and estimates considered most critical are allowances for doubtful accounts  accruals for contingent liabilities  revenue recognition and impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
more information regarding significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts the carrying value of our accounts receivable is continually evaluated based on the likelihood of collection 
an allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements customer s inability to make required payments 
the allowance is determined by historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  overall level of outstanding accounts receivables  information about specific customers with respect of their inability to make payments and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accruals for contingent liabilities the amounts we record for estimated claims  such as self insurance programs  warranty and other contingent liabilities  requires us to make judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use past history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results may be different than we estimate 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for the galvanizing services segment upon completion of the galvanizing process performed on the customers material or shipment of this material 
revenue is recognized for the electrical and industrial products segment upon transfer of title and risk to customers  or based upon the percentage of completion method of accounting for electrical products built to customer specifications under long term contracts 
deferred revenue presented in the balance sheet arises from advanced payments received from our customers prior to shipment of the product and are not related to revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method 
the extent of progress for revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is measured by the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs at completion 
contract costs include direct labor and material  and certain indirect costs 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are able to be determined 
the assumptions made in determining the estimated cost could differ from actual performance resulting in a different outcome for profits or losses than anticipated 
impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we record impairment losses on long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted projected cash flows associated with those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
in those situations  impairment losses on a long lived assets are measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the asset s fair value  generally determined based upon discounted estimates of future cash flows 
a significant change in events  circumstances or projected cash flows could result in an impairment of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets 
due to depressed cyclical demand  certain operations of the electrical and industrial products segment have been operating at approximately break even levels 
we believe our operating plans to increase market share and improve operating efficiencies  and a recovery in the cyclical demand for products will improve these operations performance 
however  should demand deteriorate further  we could be required to recognize an impairment 
an annual impairment test of goodwill is performed in the fourth quarter of each year 
the test is calculated using the anticipated future cash flows from our operating segments 
based on the present value of the future cash flow  we will determine whether impairment may exist 
a significant change in projected cash flows or cost of capital for future years could result in an impairment of goodwill in future years 
variables impacting future cash flows include  but are not limited to  the level of customer demand for and response to products and services we offer to the power generation market  the electrical transmission and distribution markets  the general industrial market and the hot dip galvanizing market  changes in economic conditions of these various markets  raw material and natural gas costs  and availability of experienced labor and management to implement our growth strategies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk affecting our operations results primarily from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we manage our exposures to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable and fixed rate debt 
we had approximately million of variable rate borrowings at february  after hedges 
on our variable interest rate borrowings  a one percent upward or downward change in interest rates would equate to an approximate  increase or decrease to interest expense

index to financial statements we manage our exposures to commodity prices  primarily zinc used in its galvanizing services segment  by utilizing agreements with zinc suppliers that include protective caps to guard against rising commodity prices 
we believe these agreements ensure adequate supplies and partially offset exposure to commodity price swings 
in the electrical and industrial segment  we have exposure to commodity pricing for copper  aluminum  and steel 
increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses to our customer s contracts  although during difficult market conditions these escalation clauses may not be readily obtainable 
we do not believe that a hypothetical change of of the interest rate currently in effect or a change of of commodity prices would have a significantly adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that either interest rates or commodity prices will not change in excess of that hypothetical amount
