item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview highlights our fiscal net product sales of approximately million represented an increase of over fiscal firearms sales  our core business  increased by 
income from operations in fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal we also completed a refinancing of our outstanding debt in january we repaid the tomkins note  which not only had a interest rate  but also included many restrictive covenants that would have prevented us from growing the business until repaid 
as a result of the refinancing  we have significantly improved our balance sheet with total debt at april  of million as compared with million at april  we anticipate that the annual interest savings from this refinancing will be approximately million 

table of contents restatement sec inquiry in august  we decided to amend various reports previously filed with the sec to modify certain accounting matters related to our acquisition of smith wesson corp 
we decided to restate our form ksb report for the fiscal year ended april  as well as our form qsb reports for the quarters ended july  and  october  and  and january  and the form ksb report for the fiscal year ended april  was filed in december and included restated financial statements for fiscal the amended form qsb reports for the july and october quarters were filed in january  and the amended form qsb reports for the january quarters were filed in march we are current in all of our sec filings 
the sec is conducting an informal inquiry regarding the circumstances surrounding the restatement 
we are cooperating fully with the sec in this inquiry 
the inquiry is still ongoing 
in june  we determined that our previously reported financial statements for   and the first three quarters of required restatement to increase compensation expense for certain employee stock awards 
we issued warrants  to two former employees in may  containing a cashless exercise feature  and as a result compensation expense should have been adjusted in subsequent periods through april  for increases or decreases in the quoted value of our stock 
in addition  in fiscal and  we should have recorded compensation expense resulting from the modification of certain vested stock options for terminating employees 
for the year ended april   we decided to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  revised  sfas r  using the modified retrospective application method 
we filed form k on july  describing the need to restate our previously issued financial statements to correct compensation expense and our decision to adopt fas r 
the financial statements included in this form k have been restated to correct compensation expense and to adopt sfas r 
the effects of these restatements are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
management objectives in fiscal  we added several new senior managers to our company  including a new chief executive officer in december the new management team has been assessing our business  including extensive market research about the smith wesson brand  the firearms market  and our competitors 
our research has determined that the smith wesson brand stands for safety  security  protection  and sport 
our management team has decided to focus its strategy around those four items 
all future ventures and licensing opportunities will fit under the umbrella of safety  security  protection  and sport 
it is our view that opportunities for the company extend beyond handguns 
this belief is supported by brand research that has identified several areas where the smith wesson brand has a strong recognition among prospective buyers 
while we will continue to grow in the handgun market  with an increased emphasis on the military and law enforcement markets  we will also look beyond the handgun market using safety  security  protection  and sport as the guide for determining business expansion 
our business we are one of the largest handgun manufacturers in the world 
we offer one of the broadest lines of handguns in the industry 
our product line consists of both revolvers and pistols 
we are also one of the largest manufacturers of handcuffs and restraints in the united states 
key performance indicators we evaluate the performance of our business based upon operating profit  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses  and certain components of other income and expense 
we also use ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization to evaluate our performance 
we evaluate our various product lines by such measurements as cost per unit produced  units produced per day  and incoming orders per day 

table of contents key industry data the handgun market in the united states has remained relatively constant over the past years 
handguns have been subject to legislative actions in the past  and the market has reacted to these actions 
there was a substantial increase in sales in the early s during the period leading up and shortly after the enactment of the brady bill 
in the through period  the us handgun market increased by over  as consumers purchased handguns in fear of prohibition of handgun ownership 
federal excise tax collections represents the best measurement of us market share 
the us government issues this information on a quarterly basis 
by comparing our tax payment to the reported collection  we can estimate our market share 
based upon the most recent data  we believe that we have approximately a share of the us consumer market for handguns 
this compares to in the period just before we acquired smith wesson corp 
it also compares favorably with market share figures of the s when we had an estimated market share

licensing revenue the following table sets forth certain information relative to licensing revenue for the fiscal years ended april   and change change licensing revenue for fiscal increased by  or  over the previous fiscal year 
the increase in licensing revenue resulted from new licensees added during the year 
we have hired a vice president licensing with an extensive background in the field 
we plan to focus on areas that have synergy with our core products  our brand  and our customer base 
we also intend to add additional licensees and to develop strategies with our existing licensees to assist them in expanding their business and thereby increase our licensing revenue

the substantial increase in capital expenditures led to a significant increase in depreciation expense 
depreciation expense included in cost of goods sold increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal we also incurred an additional  in manufacturing consulting fees relative to studies of our manufacturing processes 
in january  we moved several of our production departments to a seven day workweek 
this required the hiring of approximately additional production workers 
we incurred an additional  in costs in preparation for the move to a seven day workweek 
in addition  we incurred production inefficiencies and higher than normal scrap as a result of the start up of this new production schedule 
gross profit in fiscal also included a  refund from one of our insurance carriers for legal expenses relative to product liability and municipal litigation defense costs 
gross profit for fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal the increase in gross profit was attributable to the increase in net product sales as well as improvements in efficiency 
our increased handgun production  without a corresponding increase in staffing and infrastructure  led to improved efficiency 
table of contents as evidenced by the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net product sales and licensing revenue 
the dismissal of several of the municipal litigation cases resulted in a reduction of our reserves 
this had a favorable impact on gross profit of  refunds from insurance carriers on defense costs paid in fiscal reduced cost of sales by  gross profit  as a percentage of net product and services sales and license revenue increased from for fiscal to for fiscal operating expenses the following table sets forth certain information regarding operating expenses for the fiscal years ended april   and change change research and development  net sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring costs operating expenses net product and services sales and license revenue operating expenses for fiscal decreased by  or  over fiscal fiscal operating expenses included  related to the discontinued crossings catalog and advanced technology divisions   related to the restructuring costs relative to the closing our corporate office in scottsdale   related to legal and accounting fees relative to the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal and the sec inquiry  for a total of  of expenses in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal fiscal operating expenses included  in recruiting and relocation expenses for the chief executive officer and several senior management additions 
this was an increase of  over fiscal spending on recruiting and relocation 
stock option expense  as calculated under sfas r totaled  for fiscal versus  for fiscal profit sharing expense of  in fiscal was  higher versus fiscal spending as a result of increased profits 
operating expenses for fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal of the increase in fiscal operating expenses   is identified above 
in addition  we incurred  related to higher profit sharing expenses due to increased profits   related to increased advertising expenses  and  related to higher management bonuses 
stock option expense for fiscal decreased by  from  in fiscal to  income from operations the following table sets forth certain information regarding operating income for the fiscal years ended april    and change change income from operations net product and services sales and license revenue income from operations was  for fiscal  an increase of  or  compared with operating income of  in fiscal the increase in income from operations income was 
table of contents primarily due to the reduction in operating expenses 
as noted above  in fiscal  there were a number of one time expenses totaling  that did not recur in fiscal income from operations was  for fiscal  an increase of compared to income from operations of  in fiscal the increase reflected the improved results of our handgun operation and the reduction of the municipal litigation reserve  partially offset by the losses incurred by the discontinued divisions  restructuring costs  and legal and accounting fees related to the restatement and the sec inquiry 
these one time items and discontinued products and services  increased expenses by  other income expense other expense totaled  for fiscal compared with expense of  for fiscal we realized a  gain from the sale of our identi kit business 
partially offsetting this gain was  in exchange losses related to the purchase of inventory from walther 
other expense totaled  for fiscal compared with income of  for fiscal other expense included a  exchange loss related to purchase of inventory from walther 
while we purchased forward contracts to reduce our exposure to exchange losses  the dollar declined so significantly against the euro that we were unable to protect ourselves fully against the loss 
other income of  in fiscal included a gain on the sale of land of  interest income of  for fiscal represented a decline of  versus  in fiscal due to reduced cash available for investment 
interest income of  for fiscal represented a decline of  versus  for fiscal again due to reduced cash available for investment as well as a decline in interest rates on invested cash 
interest expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding interest expense for the fiscal years ended april    and change change interest expense declined by  in fiscal due primarily to the refinancing that was completed in january monthly interest expense declined by approximately  per month as a result of the refinancing 
interest expense declined in fiscal by  due to repayments made in fiscal and on the tomkins note 
we made early payments on the tomkins note in fiscal  totaling  we repaid an additional  in fiscal the interest rate on this note is 
income taxes our income tax expense for fiscal was  compared to an income tax benefit of  in fiscal and an income tax benefit of  in fiscal the tax provision for fiscal included a  adjustment resulting from the write off of an internal revenue code section limitation to our federal net operating loss carryforward of  discussed below and  of tax expense related to tax deficiencies on exercises of employee stock options under sfas r 
the tax benefit for fiscal was primarily attributable to the federal net operating loss adjustments described below and the reversal of  of our state tax valuation allowance 
the tax benefit in fiscal of  related primarily to the reversal of approximately million and million of federal and state valuation allowances 
the fiscal tax provision included a  benefit for federal net operating loss adjustments 
this benefit related to the filing of amended fiscal and federal income tax returns to recognize tax deductions for warrant and option exercises 
we were previously not entitled to these deductions as we had not 
table of contents complied with federal statutory reporting requirements 
we have subsequently complied with these reporting requirements  and we therefore are now entitled to realize these tax benefits related to the warrant and option exercises 
our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets  liabilities  and net operating loss carryforwards 
these amounts are reflected in the balance of our net deferred tax assets  which totaled approximately million  before valuation allowance  at april  in assessing the realization of our deferred income tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets depends upon generating future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and before our net operating loss carryforwards expire 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be recovered  a valuation allowance will be established against some or all of our deferred income tax assets 
recording a valuation allowance or reversing a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
no valuation allowance was provided on our deferred federal income tax assets as of april   and  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all such assets will be realized 
we do  however  continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately   and  provided against our state deferred tax assets as of april   and  respectively 
this valuation allowance specifically relates to state net operating loss carryforwards 
there is uncertainty related to the recognition of the benefit attributable to these state net operating losses 
we reached these conclusions after considering both changes in our business as well as the availability of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies  and the likelihood of generating future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
differences between forecasted and actual future operating results could adversely impact our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended april   we determined that a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was no longer needed  with the exception for certain state deferred tax assets 
we reached this conclusion despite the existence of cumulative losses in recent years 
cumulative losses are weighted heavily in the overall assessment of the need for a valuation allowance 
in making this assessment  we took into consideration the existence of significant expenses in the fiscal year ended april  relating to the acquisition of smith wesson corp 
that are not recurring in this or future fiscal years 
in prior years  we had losses before income taxes for financial reporting purposes 
for fiscal years ended april   and  we are reporting pre tax income of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
net operating loss carryforwards of million and million were utilized in fiscal and  respectively 
we believe that existing levels of income from changes in our operations that have taken place or will take place are sufficient to generate the minimum amounts of taxable income set forth below to utilize our deferred tax assets and net operating losses before they expire 
such changes included i maintaining a strong order backlog  ii successful launch of new firearm products  which have been well received by the marketplace  iii new licensing strategies  which are projected to generate royalty income  and iv other changes in an effort to increase the efficiency of our business operations  including the closing of our scottsdale  arizona office and discontinuing our crossings catalog and the advanced technology divisions 
we believe this positive evidence outweighs negative evidence of prior year losses in fiscal to utilize all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards before expiration  we would need to generate minimum taxable income of million the amount of net operating loss carryforwards before as of april   we have total gross book as compared to tax temporary differences of million  which may result in future tax deductions 
therefore  future income of million would need to be generated to realize all of our deferred tax assets 
we believe our current level of pre tax earnings are sufficient to realize all of these deferred tax assets

these carryforwards will expire as follows expires expires expires expires expires net operating loss carryforwards reflecting in deferred tax assets have been reduced by million pursuant to footnote of sfas r 
during fiscal year  we completed our analysis pursuant to internal revenue code section section 
this analysis determined that we had an ownership change within the definition of section during the calendar year ended december  as a result of this ownership change  net operating losses of million incurred prior to the ownership change are subject to a limitation of million annually  subject to increases for built in gains 
this limitation results in  of net operating loss carryforwards expiring unutilized 
therefore  the deferred tax asset attributable to the expiring net operating losses of  has been reversed 
it is possible that future substantial changes in our ownership could occur that could result in additional ownership changes pursuant to internal revenue code section if such an ownership change should occur  there would be an annual limitation on the remaining net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards which can be utilized 

table of contents based on our projections of future taxable income  we expect to utilize the largest portion of our net operating loss carryforward over the next five to six years 
finally  since our net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until  and based on our projections of future financial reporting income  we expect to utilize all of our net deferred income tax assets of million after million state tax valuation allowance over the next six to seven years 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activity qpa  which will be phased in from through pursuant to fasb staff position no 
 application of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activity provided by the ajca the effect of this deduction is reported in the period in which it is claimed on our tax return 
the qpa deduction is expected to be available to us starting in fy no deduction will be available in a year we have a tax loss or no taxable income due to operating loss carryforwards 
as we have net operating loss carryforwards  further analysis is required in order to determine the timing and impact of the qpa to our financial statements 
in return for the qpa  the ajca provides for a two year transition from the existing extraterritorial income exclusion eti tax benefit for foreign sales  which the world trade organization wto ruled  was an illegal export subsidy 
the eti benefit will be fully phased out for us in fy the eti benefit for us was approximately  and  for fiscal years and net income the following table sets forth certain information regarding net income and the related per share data for the fiscal years ended april    and change change net income net income per share basic diluted the increase in net income and net income per share for fiscal resulted primarily from a reduction in operating expenses 
fiscal spending included  related to the discontinued crossings catalog and advanced technology divisions   related to the restructuring costs relative to the closing our corporate office in scottsdale   related to legal and accounting fees relative to the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal  and the sec inquiry 
fiscal results also reflected the benefit of an agreement reached with one of our insurance carriers  which included a net cash refund of approximately million 
the decrease in net income and net income per share for fiscal resulted primarily from the comparative effect of an income tax valuation allowance reversed for fiscal of approximately million that resulted in an income tax benefit 
the reversal of the allowance was triggered by our improved profitability and the likelihood that we would be able to utilize income tax loss carryforwards 
in addition  the losses associated with our crossings catalog and advanced technology divisions  the restructuring charges incurred in the third quarter  and the costs related to the restatement and the sec inquiry eroded the profitability in fiscal the adoption of sfas r was to record additional stock compensation expense of   and  for year end april    and  respectively 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal cash requirements are to finance the growth of our firearms and licensing operations and to service our existing debt 
capital expenditures for new products  capacity expansion  and process improvements represent important cash needs 
the following table sets forth certain information relative to cash flow for the fiscal years ended april    and change change operating activities investing activities financing activities total operating activities represent the principal source of our cash flow 
cash flow from operating activities increased by  for fiscal compared with fiscal the improvement in operating cash flow in fiscal was attributable to improved profitability  which was further enhanced by our use of tax loss carry forwards 
accounts receivable improved substantially during the year as a result of collecting the open receivable from the fiscal fourth quarter sales promotion 
inventories increased by million as a result of the increased volume and replenishing finished goods inventory that was depleted below normal levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal cash flow from operating activities increased by  for fiscal compared with fiscal the improvement in operating cash flow in fiscal was attributable to improved profitability 
we launched an aggressive sales promotion campaign in january the program included extended payment terms to our distributors 
as a result  accounts receivable collections were lower than our historical levels 
while this program resulted in higher sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal  the cash impact was not felt until fiscal cash provided by investing activities totaled  compared with a cash use of  in fiscal  an increase of  collateralized cash deposits decreased by  as a result of the refinancing that was completed in january capital expenditures of  in fiscal were  higher than fiscal s capital expenditures of  capital expenditures in fiscal were three times the depreciation expense for the year 
we intend to spend approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal  all of which will be internally financed 
cash used for investing activities increased by  for fiscal  partially as a result of a  increase in capital expenditures 
collateralized cash deposits increased by  as a result of banking agreements relative to the forward exchange contracts we had purchased 
the  increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal resulted from our repayment of the  tomkins note as well as the refinancing of our banknorth debt in january we incurred  in costs relative to the refinancing effort 
the  decrease in cash used for financing activities for fiscal resulted from our repayment of  in debt in fiscal compared to  in fiscal repayment on the note to banknorth  our primary bank  commenced in april  and principal payments on the tomkins note commenced in may at april   we had open letters of credit aggregating million 
at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we have a million revolving line of credit with banknorth as well as access to a million line starting on may  for capital expenditures 

table of contents other matters inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on us during fiscal   or critical accounting policies use of estimates in preparation of financial statements use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
our significant estimates include accruals for warranty  product liability  workers compensation  environmental liability  excess and obsolete inventory and medical claims payable 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is generally upon shipment 
the substantial portion of our revenues are from product sales 
we also provide tooling  forging  heat treating  finishing  plating  and engineering support services to customers  such revenues are recognized when accepted by the customer  when no further contingencies or material performance obligations exist  and when collectibility is reasonably assured  thereby earning us the right to receive and retain payments for services performed and billed 
we recognize trademark licensing revenues for all individual licensees on a quarterly basis based on actual receipts from licensees 
this revenue consists of minimum royalties and or a percentage of a licensee s sales on licensed products 
under our current licensing agreements  these revenues are payable on a calendar quarter basis 
fees received upon initial signing of license agreements are recognized as revenues 
as a result of a combination of uncertain factors  regarding existing licensees  including current and past payment performance  market acceptance of the licensee s product and insufficient historical experience  we believe that reasonable assurance of collectibility does not exist based on the results and past payment performance of licensees in general 
therefore  we do not initially recognize minimum royalty payments  but instead record such revenue when the minimum royalty is paid 
as of april   minimum royalties to be collected in the future amounted to approximately million 
product liability we provide reserves for potential product liability defense costs based on estimates determined in consultation with litigation counsel  exclusive of any insurance reimbursements 
adjustments to the provision for product liability are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are charged or credited to cost of sales 
this evaluation is based upon information regarding potential or existing product liability cases 
any future costs as a result of this evaluation are recorded when considered both probable and reasonably estimable 
at this time  the estimated range of reasonably possible additional losses  as that term is defined in sfas no 
 is zero 
environmental liability we provide reserves for potential environmental obligations that we consider probable and for which reasonable estimates of such obligations can be made 
as of april   we had a reserve of million for environmental matters  which is recorded on an undiscounted basis

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar 
a portion of our gross revenues during the three and twelve months ended april  million and million  respectively  representing approximately and  respectively  of aggregate gross revenues came from the sale of goods that were purchased  wholly or partially from a european manufacturer  in euros 
annually  we purchase approximately million of inventory from a european supplier 
this exposes us to risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a drop in the value of the us dollar in relation to the euro would  to the extent not covered through price adjustments  reduce the company s gross profit on that million of inventory by approximately million 
in an effort to offset our risks from unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations  we entered into euro participating forward options under which we would purchase euros which in turn would be used to pay the european manufacturer 
as of april  our outstanding contracts had a remaining balance of million euros 
contracts are for  euros per month with the last month expiring in october participating forward options provide full protection for us against the depreciation of the us dollar against the euro and partial benefit from the appreciation of the us dollar against the euro 
if the euro strengthens above the average rate  we will not pay for the euros at more than the average rate 
if the euro weakens below the average rate  we would pay of the euros at the average rate and the remaining of the euros are paid for at the spot rate 
each option  unless used prior to the expiration date  will be converted at the expiration date to a forward contract  due when needed during the month at a slight up charge in rate 
during the three and twelve months ended april   we experienced a net gain of and  respectively  on such contracts that we executed during the period in an effort to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the euro dollar exchange rate 
as of april   we had participating forward options totaling million euros remaining which were reported as a liability of
