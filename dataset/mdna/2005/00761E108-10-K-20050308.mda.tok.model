item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of high performance rf and switching power semiconductors 
we are primarily focused on the high power  high speed segment of the power semiconductor market 
power semiconductors function as power amplifiers and power switches 
they increase system efficiency and reliability by precisely managing and regulating electricity and converting it into the form required by electrical and electronic products 
our products permit the design of more compact end products and improve system features and functionality 
our products are found in diverse applications  such as f fighter cockpits  the boeing back up power system  the international space station  air traffic control radar systems  semiconductor capital equipment  mri systems  arc welding equipment  industrial lasers  solar power panels and wireless communications base stations 
certain markets we serve  such as the semiconductor capital equipment and communications and data processing markets  have historically been quite cyclical 
during periods of contraction in the these cyclical markets  we have experienced downward pressure on our revenues and gross margins 
we have attempted to reduce this volatility through acquisitions and product development in less cyclical markets  such as the military aerospace and medical equipment markets  and by rigorously managing our expenses through increased offshore production 
power semiconductors generally dissipate more than one watt of power and have a broad range of frequency capabilities 
we primarily focus on high power  high speed devices that dissipate at least several hundred watts of power and require operating frequencies greater than khz  or  cycles per second eg  the product may switch on and off up to  times per second 
we sell our products in north america  europe  and asia primarily pursuant to customer purchase orders 
we sell through a network of independent sales representatives and distributors 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products 
we have operations in bend  oregon  santa clara  california  montgomeryville  pennsylvania  boulder  colorado  and bordeaux  france 
each site has production  research and development and administrative activities 
we also make use of subcontract manufacturers for the fabrication of our wafers and for assembly and test operations 
our locations are more fully described in business properties 
in  we acquired ghz technology and the product lines and certain assets of microsemi rf products to help us further penetrate the markets for rf devices 
we believe that these acquisitions have positioned us as a leading supplier in bipolar rf power transistors and added substantial rf technology  engineering  manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
in  we acquired the assets  including prototype inventories  equipment  patents  and other intellectual property from a development stage business  zeus semiconductor  inc  for paid in cash from operations 
in january  we acquired powersicel  inc for approximately million in cash from operations in exchange for all of the existing shares of powersicel   apt stock options in exchange for the powersicel stock options and  apt stock options for the retention of key employees 
powersicel s and zeus semiconductor s combined expertise in silicon carbide and other compound semiconductor technology and products complement apt s current portfolio of rf products which operate at frequencies ranging from mhz to ghz and are sold into applications such as semiconductor capital equipment  medical imaging  radar  avionics and wireless communications 
we believe these acquisitions add valuable development capability to apt s core capability in rf power transistors allowing apt to better serve its current markets and to expand into new markets 
as a result of the acquisitions of ghz technology  inc and the product lines and certain assets of microsemi rf products  inc in  we recorded acquisition related charges for purchased in process research and development ipr d  amortization of intangible assets  inventory fair value adjustments and deferred compensation amortization of  of which  was included in costs of goods sold and  in operating expenses 
the total amount of these items net of taxes was  in  as a result of the acquisitions made  we recorded acquisition related charges for amortization of intangible assets and deferred compensation amortization of  of which  was included in costs of goods sold and in operating expenses 
also recorded in was of restructuring related charges included in operating expenses 
during we acquired the administrative building we leased in santa clara  california in order to avoid future lease payments which were substantially above market rate 
the building is reported as assets held for sale  and accordingly we took a impairment charge to adjust the carrying value to fair market value 
also included in restructuring charges is severance related to downsizing and organizational changes 
during we recorded a tax expense for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets for the total amount for these items net of taxes was  in  as result of the acquisitions made  we recorded acquisition related charges for amortization of intangible assets and deferred compensation amortization of  of which  was included in costs of goods sold and in operating expenses 
in  we acquired the assets  including prototype inventories  equipment  patents  and other intellectual property from a development stage business  zeus semiconductor  inc as a result of this transaction  during we recorded acquisition related charges for purchased ipr d of also recorded in was of restructuring related charges included in operating expenses 
these charges included severance related to downsizing and organizational changes we began in the charges also include an additional impairment charge on the administrative building we purchased in as explained above  as well as costs to exit certain production activities 
the latter charges relate to accelerated depreciation on certain production related equipment to be abandoned after shutdown and contractual closing costs 
during we also incurred of charges in connection with the filing and subsequent withdrawal of a registration statement 
the total amount of these items net of taxes was  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
certain statements contained herein may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  as discussed more fully herein 
our markets we operate on a worldwide basis 
as such  our operations are affected by global  regional and industry specific economic and political factors 
in  of our revenue was from customers in north america  from customers in europe  and from customers in asia and the rest of the world 
we allocate revenue geographically based on the location to which we ship our products 
the markets for our products are diversified  and include military and aerospace  semiconductor capital equipment  medical and industrial  and communications and data processing 
we believe demand is being driven by the emergence of new applications for higher power  higher frequency semiconductors that more precisely manage power  and also by the need to increase performance and improve power quality for existing applications 
in particular  demand in our target markets is being driven by the cyclical upturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market and a recovery in the communications and data processing market  as well as growth in demand for complex medical equipment and military and commercial radar equipment 
we believe demand is also being driven by the need for more efficient energy use resulting from rising energy costs  government mandates and environmental concerns 
business strategies our goal is to be the world leader in providing high performance power semiconductors for high power  high speed applications 
to achieve our goal  we intend to increase our penetration of core markets and customers and expand globally  continue to develop and commercialize leading edge technology for new and existing applications  capitalize on and expand our rf expertise  continue to optimize manufacturing operations  and seek to enhance growth through selective acquisitions critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns and warranty obligations  allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  income taxes  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  valuation of long lived assets  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the timing of revenue recognition that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  sales allowances  returns and warranty obligations we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
in general  we provide for a one year repair or replacement warranty on our products 
we use independent distributors to sell some of our products 
our distributors have certain stock rotation rights which allow them to rotate up to of their products every six months in exchange for an order of an equal amount of new product 
in addition  we may on a case by case basis grant to distributors certain price protections on purchased products 
upon shipment  we record an allowance for the estimated cost that may be incurred for product warranty and sales returns based on historical experience and any contractual requirements with our distributors 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product non conformance rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product non conformance 
should actual product non conformance rates  material usage  service delivery costs  or distributor returns differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of the allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  historical bad debts  the customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant individual accounts that are past due to determine whether an allowance should be made based on these factors 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
excess and obsolete inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market net realizable value 
we adjust inventory costs for estimated unmarketable excess or obsolete inventory to estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we establish reserves for excess component order cancellation costs based on estimated net realizable value of the components purchased and any additional cancellation charges 
we evaluate historical usage of the product  current customer demand  purchase commitments and forecasted usage of the product 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments or reserves may be required 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to decrease the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   we had a full valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives we value goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
currently we carry a goodwill balance in connection with previous acquisitions  but have no other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we annually review goodwill for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset might exceed its current fair value 
we determine fair value using discounted cash flow analysis and other acceptable valuation methodologies such as market multiples and comparable transactions 
this requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans  which reflect changes we anticipate in the economy and industry 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge as a result of writing down the carrying value of goodwill 
valuation of long lived assets we value long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives  in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we determine the potential impairment using undiscounted cash flow analysis  which requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans  which reflect changes we anticipate in the economy and industry 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge as a result of writing down the carrying value of long lived assets 
if the asset group is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  then intangible assets are written down first  followed by the other long lived assets of the operation  to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the assets 
long lived assets considered held for sale are valued at the lower of historical cost or fair value less costs to sell 
such assets are not depreciated while so classified 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenue years ended december  revenue  net cost of goods sold amortization of technology rights and other charges total cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charges in process research development total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense interest income  net other  net income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss years ended december  and revenue 
our revenue for was million  compared to million in  or a increase 
overall we experienced year over year growth in each of the four markets we serve 
communications and data processing revenue increased by  semiconductor capital equipment increased by  military aerospace increased by and industrial medical increased by 
improved demand in the wireless base station and other communications infrastructure applications contributed to our year over year growth in the communications and data processing markets  particularly in asia 
our revenue for the semiconductor capital equipment market grew sequentially each quarter from the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of  but then declined in the second half of the year due to an inventory correction underway at our customers and weakened market conditions 
our year over year growth in the semiconductor equipment market was a result of strong market conditions in the first half of and the geographical expansion of our customer base into japan 
revenue for our industrial and medical market grew sequentially each quarter from the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of  but declined into the fourth quarter of during our military and aerospace revenue benefited from the shipment of products related to a large radar systems order which was received in the fourth quarter of we expect to continue to benefit from increased spending on commercial and military aerospace programs as well as from designs we have won in aviation and radar systems in foreign markets 
however  revenue in this market can experience sharp variability due to the ordering pattern of our end customers 
overall  our revenue by geographic area for was in north america  in europe  and in asia and the rest of the world 
this compares to in north america  in europe and in asia and the rest of the world in we allocate revenue geographically based on the location to which we ship our products 
our rf products revenue was of the total in  compared to in overall  we experienced a record revenue year in at million 
the growth and strength came from a broad base of end markets  applications  and customers  as we continue to pursue opportunities in each of our end markets  which helps us to diversify our product portfolio 
over time we expect that each of the four markets we serve will contribute approximately equally to our revenue 
in  our revenue by market was    and versus    and in  in the communications and data processing  semiconductor capital equipment  industrial medical  and military aerospace markets  respectively 
in the second half of we did experience slowing of revenue in the communications and data processing  semiconductor capital equipment  and industrial medical markets as a result of reduced customer demand and inventory corrections at some customers 
in  we believe that revenue growth will be derived primarily from new products and design wins rather than from significantly improved market conditions 
gross profit 
our gross profit margin was in compared to in  or an increase of 
excluding the non cash purchase accounting charges for the fair value of inventory acquired and the amortization of the technology rights assets  gross profit margin was in compared to in  or an increase of 
increased production volumes and the resulting increased factory utilization at all of our domestic facilities resulted in improved factory overhead absorption in compared to our bend wafer production increased by over in from  contributing approximately to our improved gross margin 
while our santa clara facility production volume also increased  it was offset by higher costs associated with the acceleration of a production ramp up for a major rf customer and a less profitable overall product mix 
the overall impact of the santa clara facility contributed a slight decline to consolidated gross margin 
during we idled our wafer fabrication facility in montgomeryville  pennsylvania as we moved the production of these wafers to our bend  oregon facility  resulting in lower manufacturing spending at the pennsylvania location 
full production ramp up for these wafers in bend  oregon is expected in mid the lower manufacturing costs at our montgomeryville  pennsylvania facility contributed to a slight increase to consolidated gross margin  essentially offsetting the decline from santa clara 
during we also completed a reduction in work force at our bordeaux  france facility and moved more of the production to lower cost subcontractors 
at the volumes experienced in  this did not have a significant impact on consolidated gross margin 
research and development expense 
our research and development expenses were million in compared to million in  or approximately and of revenue  respectively 
during  our spending on materials and supplies increased by approximately  compared to during  fewer resources were used for pre production and prototype lots as many of the new products we introduced utilizing our mos technology moved into full production  resulting in lower spending in on materials and supplies 
in addition  in  we continued our spending on materials and supplies in developing both new rf and switching power products 
in our spending on payroll costs increased by approximately  compared to this was due to the addition of new personnel and also to the reallocation of existing personnel to research and development activities 
new personnel accounted for approximately half of the payroll spending increase 
the decrease in the research and development expense as a percentage of revenue is also due to our higher revenue levels in the company plans to continue its research and development programs leading to the introduction of new products for use in both switching and rf applications 
therefore  we expect the level of research and development expenses to be approximately of revenue over sustained periods of time 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expenses totalled million in compared to million in  or approximately and of revenue in and  respectively 
the increase in expenses over the prior year is partially attributable to higher legal costs in connection with a patent litigation matter 
in the these legal expenses were million  compared to million in as previously announced in june   the united states district court of the northern district of california has granted summary judgment in favor of apt  dismissing ixys corporation s claims of patent infringement against apt 
therefore our legal costs decreased substantially in the second half of a portion of the increase over was also due to additional sales commission expense of  on higher overall revenue and higher payroll costs of  primarily due to the management cash bonus incentive plan 
interest and other income expense 
interest income in was  compared to  in overall  our invested cash and prevailing interest rates were comparable between and interest expense was  in compared to  in other income expense  net was an expense of  in compared to an expense of  in in  the company expensed approximately  in professional costs associated with the filing and subsequent withdrawal of our registration statement on form s for a securities offering 
restructuring charges 
as part of management s strategic plans  the company announced in november of restructuring actions intended to improve manufacturing efficiencies and lower administrative costs 
the actions include consolidation of certain administrative functions  rationalization of internal and external assembly and test manufacturing  and the reduction of rent expense through the purchase and resale of one of the two buildings currently occupied by the company s santa clara  california subsidiary 
these announced actions were in addition to previously disclosed plans to consolidate our wafer fabrication plant in montgomeryville  pennsylvania to bend  oregon 
total restructuring related charges recognized in and were  and  respectively 
the total severance related charges recognized in and were  and  respectively 
the severance charges related to already separated personnel and personnel costs associated with benefits expected to be paid upon completion of certain eligible transfer activities 
the building purchase is reported as an asset held for sale and is being marketed for sale as apt no longer requires the space 
in accordance with sfas  an asset held for sale is carried at estimated net fair value 
as such  apt recorded an impairment charge for the building of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
fair value was estimated based on comparable sales data of similar commercial space in the area 
the net carrying value of the building as of december  was approximately and is included as a component of other current assets 
additional restructuring costs of  associated with costs to exit certain production activities were also recognized in the charges relate to accelerated depreciation on certain production related equipment to be abandoned after shutdown and contractual closing costs 
income taxes 
in  the company recorded a tax expense of  for an effective rate of 
the company recorded a full valuation allowance against its remaining net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of in assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets  sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires a more likely than not standard 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future domestic taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
although the company anticipates future long term profitability  sfas no 
requires that recent historical operating performance weigh more heavily in assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets 
the more likely than not assessment was principally based upon the losses generated during and and the cyclical nature of the industry which make projections of industry trends difficult 
while the company has sufficient net operating loss carry forwards nol s to offset federal taxable income for regular tax purposes  the company s use of its nol s for alternative minimum tax amt purposes are limited to of its amt income amti 
therefore  the company expects to pay amt of approximately on the remaining amti  resulting in an approximate effective tax rate of on domestic taxable income 
however  at such time the company is able to determine if it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize its net operating losses  the reserve against the net deferred tax asset would be reversed 
as of december   apt has federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of million and million  respectively  which expire beginning in years through in  we recorded a tax expense of approximately on our net loss of million 
our effective tax rate in differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the recording of a non cash charge of  to establish a full valuation reserve against our net deferred tax assets  offset by a reduction in our taxes payable by  years ended december  and revenue 
our revenue for was million  compared to million in  or a increase 
approximately of the increase reflects the additional months of revenue contributed by the acquisitions we made during  while of the increase represents organic growth on higher unit volumes 
overall we experienced year over year strength in each of the markets we serve 
communications and data processing revenue increased by  semiconductor capital equipment increased by  military and aerospace increased by and industrial medical increased by 
as a result of incremental capital spending by companies that produce semiconductors  we experienced significant strengthening in the semiconductor capital equipment market which grew by in the second half of compared to the first half 
overall  our revenue by geographic area for was in north america  in europe  and in asia and the rest of the world 
this compares to in north america  in europe and in asia and the rest of the world in gross profit 
our gross profit margin was in compared to in excluding the non cash purchase accounting charges for the fair value of inventory acquired and the amortization of the technology rights assets  gross profit margin was in compared to in  or an increase of 
lower sales returns and lower provisions for excess and obsolescent inventory contributed approximately to the improved gross margin 
increased production volumes and the resulting increased factory utilization at our facility in santa clara  california resulted in improved factory overhead absorption in compared to the improved utilization added approximately to our overall gross profit in the margin improvement due to increased utilization was partially offset by lower factory production volumes at our facility in bordeaux  france which caused a drop of approximately in our gross margin 
the company took actions to reduce production personnel by at the bordeaux facility and shift production to our lower cost offshore subcontractors 
during we began the process to consolidate the silicon manufacturing currently performed in montgomeryville  pennsylvania to our bend oregon facility in order to reduce our overall wafer fabrication production costs 
research and development expense 
our research and development expenses were million in compared to million in  or approximately and of revenue  respectively 
during  higher expenses were incurred for pre production and prototype lots  especially for our power mos technology  as the company prepared to introduce a large volume of new products in this technology 
during  fewer resources were used for pre production and prototype lots as the new parts moved into full production 
this resulted in an approximately  decline in spending on supplies  materials and prototypes over the prior year 
the decrease in the research and development expense as a percentage of revenue is also due to our higher revenue levels in selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in  or approximately and of revenue in and  respectively 
the increase in expenses over the prior year level is attributable to higher payroll costs of million as a result of the discontinuance of the graduated pay reductions we implemented in and the first half of  as well as additional personnel in selling  general and administrative functions due to new hires  the additional companies we acquired  and to the transferring of job functions from other operating areas of the company 
in addition we incurred increased legal expenses of  in connection with a patent litigation matter  as more fully explained in part i  item to this report 
stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense includes costs relating to stock based employee compensation arrangements  and is based on the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant of options and the exercise price of options to purchase that stock 
stock compensation expense is recognized over the vesting periods of the related options  typically five years 
stock compensation expense of  was recorded in versus  in of this amount   was recorded in cost of goods sold   was recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
interest income expense 
interest income in was  compared to  in the decline in interest income was due to lower invested cash balances as a result of cash used to acquire ghz and msc rf in and also due to lower interest rates available in the current market environment 
interest expense was  in compared to  in restructuring charges 
as part of management s strategic plans  the company announced in november of restructuring actions intended to improve manufacturing efficiencies and lower administrative costs 
the actions include consolidation of certain administrative functions  rationalization of internal and external assembly and test manufacturing  and the reduction of rent expense through the purchase and resale of one of the two buildings currently occupied by the company s santa clara  california subsidiary 
these announced actions were in addition to previously disclosed plans to consolidate our wafer fabrication plant in montgomeryville  pennsylvania to bend  oregon 
total restructuring related charges recognized in were the total severance related charges recognized in was  the severance charges relate to already separated personnel and personnel that are eligible for benefits upon completion of certain transfer activities 
the building buyout reduced our operating lease commitments by approximately  over and income taxes 
we recorded a tax expense of approximately on our net loss of million in  compared to a tax benefit of in our effective tax rate in differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the recording of a non cash charge of  to establish a full valuation reserve against our net deferred tax assets  offset by a reduction in our taxes payable by  liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating  investing  and financing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  investments in businesses  and access to bank credit when required and at reasonable rates 
the company s key cash flow metrics for the last five years are presented in part i  item  selected financial data of this report 
operating cash flows in  we generated approximately million from operating activities 
this resulted from our net income of million plus non cash charges for depreciation  amortization  and building impairment charges totaling million  inventory provisions of  in process research and development costs of  the loss on disposal of property and equipment of  offset by a net change in working capital resulting in the use of cash of million 
our collections from customers were approximately million in compared to million in as revenue increased over the prior year  we increased the investment in inventory and accounts receivable  partially offset by larger accounts payable balances and lower balances for prepaid expenses and other assets 
investing cash flows in  we used approximately million in investing activities  which consisted primarily of purchases of plant and equipment for million  the purchase of short term investments of million  offset by million in proceeds from the sale of short term investments 
we also used approximately  for acquisitions 
financing cash flows in  we generated approximately  from financing activities  which consisted of net proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options  offset by payments on lease obligations 
as of december   we had million in working capital 
our trade accounts receivable balance was million reflecting a days sales outstanding ratio of days  compared to trade accounts receivable of million at december   reflecting a days sales outstanding ratio of days 
based on the geographic mix of our customers and the credit terms we extend  management expects our days sales outstanding ratio to range from to days 
our inventory balance was million reflecting inventory turns of times per year  compared to an inventory balance of million at december   reflecting inventory turns of times per year 
the company continues to pursue actions to monitor inventory levels and improve inventory turns 
the calculations above are based on yearly average balances of trade accounts receivable and inventory 
apt currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of available cash balances  internally generated funds  a line of credit for million and other financing arrangements if needed 
as of december   apt had million in cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
apt s investment policy is to invest in short term  high grade liquid investments with the goal of capital preservation 
in february  we agreed to the general terms of a million line of credit with silicon valley bank 
the final agreement is expected to be complete in the first quarter of it is a revolving credit line that bears interest at the silicon valley bank prime rate or such prime rate minus basis points  depending on certain financial ratios 
we will pay commitment fees of basis points upon closing and basis points on the unused portion of the line of credit payable quarterly 
the line of credit expires on june  apt s ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be affected by market conditions as well as other risk factors as described below 
we expect from time to time to evaluate potential acquisitions and equity investments complementary to our market strategy 
to the extent we pursue such transactions  we could require additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities or to fund our working capital requirements in the event of an industry downturn or an unexpected adverse change in our business operations 
to the extent we require additional capital we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements commitments as of december  and the company did not have any unconsolidated entities or off balance sheet financial arrangements  guarantees or similar commitments with such entities 
a summary of the company s contractual obligations and commitments as of december  is presented in the table below 
purchase obligations include amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders 
payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years long term debt operating leases capital leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter fas 
fas clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of fas are effective for the fiscal year beginning january  we are currently evaluating the provisions of fas and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb finalized sfas no 
r share based payment  which will be effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june  the new standard will require us to expense stock based compensation 
under sfas no 
r  we must evaluate and determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of fas r and expect that the adoption in our third fiscal quarter ending september  will have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and earnings per share  as the stock based compensation expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings 
we do not expect the accounting change to materially affect our liquidity as equity based compensation is a no n cash expense 
the effect of expensing stock options on our results of operations and earnings per share using the black scholes model is presented in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note k stock based compensation 
risk factors affecting business and results of operations some of the statements under risk factors affecting business and results of operations  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  business and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  could  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential or continue or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology 
for example  we make statements regarding future growth of the semiconductor capital equipment  industrial and medical equipment and military and aerospace markets  and the factors affecting such growth  increased production volume from our manufacturing facilities and its related margin impact  favorable changes in our gross profit margins and increased sales of our rf products as part of overall sales  implementation of our restructuring plans  our prospects for future long term profitability  our future tax expenses and effective tax rate  our expectations with regard to research and development expenses  our expectations for funding future liquidity needs  and potential acquisitions and equity investments 
these and other forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
these factors include  among other things  those listed under risk factors affecting business and results of operations and elsewhere in this report 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
moreover  neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such statements 
we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this report 
business risks the semiconductor industry is very cyclical  and an industry downturn could reduce our revenue 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant price erosion  periods of over capacity and production shortages  variations in manufacturing costs and yields  and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
the semiconductor industry has from time to time experienced depressed business conditions 
in the past  business conditions in this industry have rapidly changed from periods of strong demand to periods of weak demand 
for example  according to the sia  the semiconductor industry declined in  after growing in any future downturn in the industry could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions or other factors beyond our control 
certain of the markets we serve are cyclical and our ability to grow and sustain growth levels may be adversely affected by a slowdown in the global economy 
we serve customers and end users in the military and aerospace  semiconductor capital equipment  medical and industrial  and communications and data processing markets 
the slowdown in the global economy during the early part of this decade generally reduced capital spending and consumer confidence  and caused us to experience weakness in our end markets and reduced our profitability 
slowdowns in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries were particularly severe and adversely affected the sales of our products used in these applications 
should the demand for our products in any of our primary target markets decline in the future  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we have historically experienced fluctuations in our operating results and we expect these fluctuations to continue  which may cause our common stock price to decline 
our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect our net revenue  gross profits and operating results 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders received  market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers  competitive pricing pressures  our ability to expand manufacturing output to meet increasing demand  the cyclical needs of our customers  the timing of goodwill impairments or restructuring or other accounting related charges  the timing and extent of our research and development expenses  the timing and extent of significant capital equipment purchases  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  and litigation expenses 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
because most of our backlog is cancelable without penalty  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  because of our fixed costs  we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing factors  or the other risk factors discussed in this prospectus  we may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in future periods 
we have incurred significant losses in certain recent periods  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain profitability in the future 
although we recorded a net profit for the year ended december   we recorded net losses in two of the last five full fiscal years 
we may incur losses in subsequent periods 
our ability to maintain profitability on a quarterly or fiscal year basis in the future will depend on a variety of factors  including our ability to increase net revenue  expand gross margins  introduce new products on a timely basis  secure sufficient fabrication capacity and control operating expenses 
if we cannot introduce new products on a timely basis  our financial results may suffer 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions 
historically in the semiconductor industry  average selling prices of products have decreased over time 
if we are unable to introduce new proprietary products with higher margins or reduce manufacturing costs to offset anticipated decreases in the prices of our existing products  then our operating results will be harmed 
our success depends upon our ability to develop improved power semiconductors for new and existing markets  to introduce these products in a timely manner  and to have these products gain market acceptance 
the development of new power semiconductors is highly complex and from time to time we have experienced delays in developing and introducing new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion of design and testing of new products  cost effectiveness  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields  and market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers 
we cannot assure you we will be able to meet these challenges or adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
due to the complexity and variety of power semiconductors  the limited number of qualified development engineers and the limited effectiveness of computer aided design systems in the design of such circuits  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis 
we cannot assure you that any products introduced by us will be adopted by existing or potential customers  or that any products initially accepted by our customers will become industry standard products 
our failure to develop and introduce new products successfully could significantly harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer 
if we cannot optimize our mix of product sales  our financial results may suffer 
if we are unable to optimize the mix of sales of relatively higher margin but lower volume products and relatively higher volume but lower margin products  our operating results may be harmed 
in order to improve our margins through sales of higher margin products it is important that in the future they represent a greater percentage of our net revenue  requiring us to develop  introduce and market new proprietary products 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing new proprietary products with the features and functionality that customers in our key markets will demand 
our revenue depends upon our products being designed into our customers products 
we generally work closely with our customers in the design stage and as a result of this collaboration from time to time we will be notified that some of our new products are incorporated into customers products or systems 
assuming we believe some volume of our products is likely to be purchased  we typically refer to this event as a design win 
the value of any design win largely depends upon the customer s decision to manufacture the designed product in production quantities  the commercial success of the customer s product and on the extent to which the design of the customer s system also accommodates incorporation of components manufactured by our competitors 
in addition  our customers could subsequently redesign their products or systems so that they no longer require our products 
for these or other reasons  we may not achieve design wins or our design wins may not result in future revenue 
strong competition in the power semiconductor market may reduce the demand for our products or the prices of our products  which could reduce our revenue and harm our business 
the power semiconductor industry is highly competitive 
significant competitive factors in the power semiconductor market include product features and performance  product quality  product reliability  technical knowledge  breadth of product line  competitive pricing  and customer service and support 
because the market for power semiconductors is diverse and highly fragmented  we encounter different competitors in our various product markets 
our principal competitors in one or more of our product areas include fairchild semiconductor  integra  international rectifier  ixys  ma com  philips and st microelectronics 
many of our competitors have substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do and may be on more approved vendor lists than we are 
we expect intensified competition from existing power semiconductor suppliers and the possible entry of new competitors 
increased competition could harm our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not harm our financial condition or our operating results 
competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of our products and result in price reductions and increases in expenses that could harm our business and our financial condition 
our financial results could be harmed if we were to lose one of our major customers or key distributors 
several of our major customers account for a significant portion of our net sales each year 
during  our top five customers accounted for of our net revenue  and one distributor  richardson electronics  accounted for of our net revenue 
if we lost richardson electronics or one of our other major customers  or if one of them reduced or canceled significant orders  our net income and operating results could be harmed 
if our relationship with richardson electronics were discontinued  or if richardson electronics should fail to provide adequate service to our customers  we could lose revenue and our operating results would suffer 
we rely heavily on our key subcontractors 
if they fail to produce needed goods and services  our business and results of operations may suffer 
we increasingly rely on third party subcontractors in europe and asia to manufacture  assemble and test most of our products 
we rely on infineon technologies  an outside foundry located in europe  and episil technologies  located in taiwan  which collectively produce a significant percentage of our wafers 
our agreement with infineon provides for fixed prices and a guaranteed purchase commitment and may be terminated upon two years notice 
in addition  we rely on siltronic to supply silicon wafers 
we also rely on team pacific and psi technologies  subcontractors in the philippines  to assemble and test most of our switching power semiconductor products 
in addition  we rely on semiconductor assembler manufacturer in malaysia to assemble and package our rf products 
we also rely on kyocera as our sole source of ceramic packaging for certain discrete rf power semiconductors 
we do not have long term fixed price contracts with any of these key subcontractors other than infineon 
disruption or termination of these arrangements or any capacity constraints that our subcontractors experience could harm our business and operating results 
political instability  labor disputes  natural disasters and other factors could disrupt the operations of our subcontractors 
if any of our subcontractors experience financial  operational  production or quality assurance difficulties resulting in a reduction or interruption in supply to us  our operating results could suffer 
additionally  our subcontractors may not be able to maintain the technological capability to meet our future needs 
working with such subcontractors may lead to reduced control over product quality and delivery schedules 
in addition  our subcontractors also manufacture and package products for our competitors  and there is a risk that our subcontractors could allocate less of their production capacity and resources to our needs or demand price increases 
if our subcontractors fail to provide needed products and services in a timely and cost effective manner  our revenue  business and results of operations may suffer 
interruptions in wafer production may harm our operating results 
any prolonged inability to utilize our bend  oregon  santa clara  california or third party foundries as a result of fire  natural disaster or otherwise could harm our financial condition and cause our operating results to suffer 
while we do carry business interruption insurance  there is no assurance that it would be available or sufficient in the event that one of our facilities was rendered unavailable 
also  at times  there are shortages of foundry capacity in the industry 
for example  in  our sales were limited by the wafer fabrication capacity available to us 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers may be harmed and our sales would likely be limited 
we may not be able to make arrangements for additional foundry capacity in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us  and could entail significant delay and additional expense 
in addition  qualifying a new foundry could require the consent of or requalification by our customers 
moreover  if we are able to secure additional foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
these penalties may be expensive and could harm our operating results 
intellectual property litigation may harm our business 
the semiconductor industry in general is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
this may require us to defend against assertions of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation raised by our competitors 
if we are unable to successfully defend against such assertions  we may be exposed to substantial liability for damages  need to obtain licenses from the intellectual property owners  discontinue or change our processes or products  and or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies if at all possible 
we cannot be certain that licenses would be available under reasonable terms or that we could successfully develop or acquire non infringing technologies 
moreover  any such efforts would likely be time consuming and consume significant management and financial resources 
thus  any involvement in intellectual property litigation could harm our operating results and financial condition 
we also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual rights by our products 
no assurance can be provided that future assertions of infringement or misappropriation will not occur  or that claims for indemnification by customers of our products will not be made  or that assertions of infringement or misappropriation especially if proven to be true will not harm our business 
if we cannot adequately protect our technologies and intellectual property rights  our financial results may suffer 
our success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect our technologies 
our competitors may independently develop technologies that are as good as or better than ours  and absent patent protection  we would be unable to stop their use of such independently developed technologies 
the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive  and we cannot assure you that our current patents are or any new patents that may be issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide any meaningful protection or any competitive advantage to us 
although none of our patents or other intellectual property rights has been successfully challenged to date  we cannot assure you that any patent owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  we have licensed a portion of our intellectual property rights to european and japanese entities and entered into two joint ventures and licensing and technology transfer agreements in china 
the china agreements were subsequently terminated 
we cannot assure you that these foreign entities have at all times remained within the scope of their contractual obligations with respect to our technology and intellectual property  or that other foreign entities have not infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property 
intellectual property law and practice differs in foreign jurisdictions  and it may prove difficult for us to protect our rights in foreign countries 
if we are unable to protect our technology and intellectual property rights  whether in the us or abroad  we could face increased competition in the market for our products and technologies  or possibly even exclusion from the market 
this would negatively affect our ability to maintain or expand our business  and thus our revenue 
if our manufacturing processes become obsolete  our margins and profitability may be harmed 
semiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change  requiring large expenditures for research and development in order to improve product performance and increase manufacturing yields 
our current process technology is likely to become obsolete at some point in the future 
if we are unable to develop or obtain access to advanced silicon wafer processing technologies as they become needed  our future operating results may suffer 
our business is subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries 
in  approximately of our revenue was from customers located outside of the us in addition  some of our manufacturing operations are not in the us the following are some of the risks inherent in doing business on an international level economic and political instability  foreign currency fluctuations  transportation delays  trade restrictions  work stoppages  disruption of local labor supply and or transportation services  inflexible employee contracts in the event of business downturns  government and license requirements governing the transfer of technology and products abroad  the burden and cost of complying with import and export regulations  risks of conflict and terrorism  diseases such as sars  and the laws  including tax laws of  and the policies of the united states toward  countries in which we manufacture our products 
in addition  we have supply agreements  assembly agreements  and other relationships with foreign companies that are subject to similar risks 
these risks could negatively affect our results of operation 
we depend on the availability of raw materials to manufacture our products  and a disruption in supply could harm our operating results 
we rely on raw materials to manufacture our products  including silicon  various chemicals  gases and compounds 
in particular  we obtain silicon wafers and ceramic packaging through limited sources of supply  and in the event of a shortage  we may be forced to locate alternative sources and be forced to pay higher prices 
a severe shortage or an increase in the price of silicon wafers or packaging may harm our gross margins and our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis  if at all 
our foundries may experience lower than expected yields  which could adversely affect our business 
the manufacture of power semiconductors is a highly complex and technically demanding process 
production yields and device reliability can be affected by a large number of factors 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields and device reliability problems  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and changes in processing steps 
there can be no assurance that our foundries will not experience lower than expected manufacturing yields or device reliability problems in the future  which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
our business may be harmed by acts of terrorism 
acts of terrorism could interrupt or restrict our business in several ways 
for example  we rely extensively on the use of air transportation to move our inventory to and from our vendors and to ship finished products to our customers 
if terrorist acts cause air transportation to be grounded or interrupted  our business could be harmed 
in addition  acts of terrorism could cause existing export regulations to be changed  which could limit the extent to which we are allowed to export our products 
to the extent that acts of terrorism also reduce customer confidence and create general economic weakness  our business could also be harmed 
an accident at our manufacturing facilities could cause serious damage for which we could be responsible 
our manufacturing operations involve high voltage equipment  explosive gases and hazardous chemicals 
an accident at our manufacturing facilities could result in serious personal injury or property damage for which we could be held financially responsible and could interrupt our operations  potentially for an extended period of time 
any losses in excess of available insurance  and any long term effects of disrupted operations  could harm our financial results 
our products are complex and could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us and our customers  defects or other performance problems may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in loss of revenue  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects may also cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with our customers 
any defects or other problems with our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers who could seek damages from us for their losses 
we may be subject to product liability claims with respect to our products 
our products are incorporated into highly expensive equipment such as aircraft  and into products where a failure may have severe consequences  such as defibrillators 
our product liability insurance coverage may be insufficient to pay any such claims 
product liability insurance may become too costly for us or may become unavailable to us in the future 
we may not have sufficient resources to satisfy any product liability claims not covered by insurance which would materially and adversely affect our financial position 
even an unsuccessful product liability claim would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
our manufacturing operations involve hazardous substances  and the costs of complying with applicable environmental laws could harm our financial results 
our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air  water and soil 
in the conduct of our manufacturing operations  we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous  toxic or volatile under federal  state  local and foreign laws 
the risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated  and if such an accidental release occurs  we could be held financially responsible for clean up costs and other consequences of the release 
in addition  if environmental laws become more stringent over time  or existing laws are more stringently enforced  we could incur greater compliance costs and be subject to increased risks and penalties for violations 
we could be held liable for significant damages for violating environmental laws and could lose certain licenses or permits  which could harm our financial results 
failure to attract and retain key technical and management personnel could harm our operating results 
our success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  particularly our development engineers  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly experienced development engineers  applications engineers and sales managers 
there is intense competition for the services of engineers in our industry 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers  development engineers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for such personnel or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could harm our business 
we do not currently carry life insurance payable to us with respect to any of our employees 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  we may lose business and experience reduced profitability or increased losses 
we have at times experienced rapid revenue growth  and we anticipate future growth if demand increases in the markets for our products 
to manage this growth successfully  we will need to manage increased production requirements  attract  retain and train new employees  including engineers and management  improve our operational and administrative systems  and manage multiple relationships with customers and suppliers 
we may be unable to accomplish any of these requirements  and our failure to do so could harm our operating results 
we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully into our business 
we have made four acquisitions since we became a public company in august  and we plan to pursue additional acquisitions of related businesses 
the expense incurred in consummating the future acquisition of related businesses  or our failure to integrate such businesses successfully into our existing businesses  could result in our company incurring unanticipated expenses and losses 
in addition  we may not be able to identify or finance additional acquisitions or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions we do complete 
in the event of future acquisitions  we could use a significant portion of our available cash  issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  or assume contingent liabilities 
should we successfully acquire another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the risks associated with acquisitions include difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition or joint venture  potential asset write downs  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
our ability to successfully manage these risks could be limited by the small size of our management team 
the occurrence of any of these risks may result in a decrease in the value of our assets and may harm our business and results of operations 
our reported financial results may be harmed by changes in us generally accepted accounting principles 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to create and interpret accounting policies 
a change in these policies or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
for example  while current accounting rules allow us to exclude the expense of stock options from our financial statements  the financial accounting standards board finalized sfas no 
r share based payment in december  which will require us to expense stock options 
we are currently evaluating the p rovisions of fas r and expect that the adoption will have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations 
this new accounting policy will be effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june  recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations may increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq stock market  have required  and will require  changes to some of our accounting and corporate governance practices  including a report on our internal controls as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of we expect these new rules and regulations to continue to increase our accounting  legal and other costs  and to make some activities more difficult  time consuming and costly 
these new rules and regulations have made  and we expect will continue to make  it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these additional expenses have and may continue to reduce our profits or increase our losses 
these new rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
investment risks the price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in the future 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is expected to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  general conditions or cyclicality in the semiconductor industry or the end markets that we serve  new or revised earnings estimates by us or industry analysts  comments or recommendations issued by analysts who follow us  our competitors or the semiconductor industry  aggregate valuations and movement of stocks in the broader semiconductor industry  announcements of new products  strategic relationships or acquisitions by us or our competitors  increases or decreases in available wafer  assembly or test capacity  governmental regulations  trade laws and import duties  announcements related to future or existing litigation involving us or any of our competitors  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  additions or departures of senior management  and other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
six members of management  as a group  own a significant interest in our common stock 
as of december   six members of our senior management messrs 
sireta  crecraft  haugen  hess  loder and tsang beneficially own approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result  these members of management exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval 
the concentrated holdings of management may result in a delay of  or serve as a deterrent to  possible attempts to take us over  which may reduce the market price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and delaware law contain provisions that may hinder or prevent a change in the control of our company 
the authorization of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to take us over 
also  we are subject to provisions of delaware law that may have similar effects 
for example  we are governed by section of the delaware general corporate law  which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock 
these and other provisions in our articles of incorporation or under delaware law may defer hostile takeovers or delay changes in control or management  which could reduce our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our cash equivalents  and the high quality and conservative nature of our long term investments  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
currently less than of our revenue is transacted in local currencies  primarily euros 
as a result  our international results of operations have limited exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we do not currently hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations 
most of our export revenue and revenue by apt europe are in us dollars  and most of our foreign currency revenue is from operations with significant expenses in the same currency 
as a result  gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been material to our consolidated results of operations
