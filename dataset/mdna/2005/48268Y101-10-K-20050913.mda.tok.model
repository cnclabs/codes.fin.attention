item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of the historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations of k sea transportation partners lp and  prior to our january  initial public offering  of our predecessor company  ew transportation llc  and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
general we are a leading provider of refined petroleum product marine transportation  distribution and logistics services in the united states domestic marine transportation business 
we currently operate a fleet of tank barges  tankers and tugboats that serves a wide range of customers  including major oil companies  oil traders and refiners 
with approximately million barrels of capacity  we believe we currently own and operate the third largest coastwise tank barge fleet in the united states  as measured by barrel carrying capacity 
demand for our services is driven primarily by demand for refined petroleum products in the east coast and gulf of mexico regions of the united states 
we generate revenue by charging customers for the transportation and distribution of their products utilizing our tank vessels and tugboats 
these services are generally provided under the following four basic types of contractual relationships time charters  which are contracts to charter a vessel for a fixed period of time  generally one year or more  at a set daily rate  contracts of affreightment  which are contracts to provide transportation services for products over a specific trade route  generally for one or more years  at a negotiated per barrel rate  voyage charters  which are charters for shorter intervals  usually a single round trip  that are made on either a current market rate or advance contractual basis  and bareboat charters  which are longer term agreements that allow a customer to operate one of our vessels and utilize its own operating staff without taking ownership of the vessel 
in addition  a variation of a voyage charter is known as a consecutive voyage charter 
under this arrangement  consecutive voyages are performed for a specified period of time 
the table below illustrates the primary distinctions among these types of contracts time charter contract of affreightment voyage charter bareboat charter typical contract length one year or more one year or more single voyage two years or more rate basis daily per barrel varies daily voyage expenses customer pays we pay we pay customer pays vessel operating expenses we pay we pay we pay we pay idle time customer pays as long as vessel is available for operations customer does not pay customer does not pay customer pays under a consecutive voyage charter  the customer pays for idle time 
see definitions below 
for contracts of affreightment and voyage charters  revenue is recognized based upon the relative transit time in each period  with expenses recognized as incurred 
although contracts of affreightment and certain contracts for voyage charters may be effective for a period in excess of one year  revenue is recognized over the transit time of individual voyages  which are generally less than ten days in duration 
for time charters and bareboat charters  revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period  with expenses recognized as incurred 
one of the principal distinctions among these types of contracts is whether the vessel operator or the customer pays for voyage expenses  which include fuel  port charges  pilot fees  tank cleaning costs and canal tolls 
some voyage expenses are fixed  and the remainder can be estimated 
if we  as the vessel operator  pay the voyage expenses  we typically pass these expenses on to our customers by charging higher rates under the contract or re billing such expenses to them 
as a result  although voyage revenue from different types of contracts may vary  the net revenue that remains after subtracting voyage expenses  which we call net voyage revenue  is comparable across the different types of contracts 
therefore  we principally use net voyage revenue  rather than voyage revenue  when comparing performance between different periods 
since net voyage revenue is a non gaap measurement  it is reconciled to the nearest gaap measurement  voyage revenue  under results of operations below 
recent events on august   we entered into a definitive purchase agreement with marine resources group  inc and saltchuk resources  inc 
to acquire  through our operating partnership  all of the outstanding capital stock of sea coast towing  inc sea coast  a wholly owned subsidiary of marine resources group based in seattle  washington 
sea coast is engaged in the maritime transportation of refined petroleum products and related businesses along the west coast of the united states and alaska 
sea coast operates tank barges and tugboats  representing approximately  barrels of capacity  of which  barrels are double hulled 
of the remaining single hull capacity  approximately is eligible to operate in the jones act trades until january  with the remaining capacity one vessel eligible until january the addition of these tank barges will represent a increase in our barrel carrying capacity to approximately million barrels  which we believe will make us the largest coastwise tank barge operator measured by barrel carrying capacity in the united states  with approximately double hull capacity 
the purchase price for sea coast consists of million in cash and  common units representing limited partner interests in us 
we expect to finance the cash portion of the purchase price through additional borrowings 
the purchase agreement contains customary representations  warranties and covenants 
the acquisition is scheduled to close in october and is subject to customary conditions  including  among others  the following the absence of any legal proceeding  law or order preventing the closing or prohibiting our ownership or operation of all or a material portion of sea coast s assets or capital stock  or compelling us to dispose of or hold separate all or a material portion of our or sea coast s business or assets  obtaining certain consents and approvals  the removal of liens on sea coast s assets  the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party  compliance of each party with its covenants and agreements  the absence of any material adverse change in the value of sea coast s capital stock or its business or financial condition  and the receipt by us of audited and unaudited financial statements with respect to sea coast that are required by rule of regulation s x of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the purchase agreement contains customary termination rights 
significant events during fiscal year on june   we acquired an  barrel capacity double hull tank barge for a purchase price of approximately million  including certain modifications made to the barge 
this acquisition was financed using borrowings under a new term loan 
this new agreement is described in further detail under liquidity and capital resources other term loans below 
from december until its acquisition  we operated the tank barge under a bareboat charter agreement 
on june   we issued and sold  common units to tortoise energy infrastructure corporation  or tortoise  in a private placement for proceeds of million  before expenses associated with the offering 
the offer and sale of the common units were made pursuant to an exemption from registration under section of the securities act of  as amended 
pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement  we have agreed to register the resale of the common units with the securities and exchange commission 
tortoise has agreed not to sell any of the common units until december  on march   we entered into a new  five year million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the new credit agreement replaced our then existing million credit agreement  which was repaid and terminated 
the new credit agreement contains a million sublimit for letters of credit and allows us to request an increase in the total availability thereunder by up to million  to a maximum of million  so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 
this new credit agreement is described in further detail under liquidity and capital resources credit agreement below 
on december   we acquired ten tank barges and seven tugboats from bay gulf trading company  ltd 
of norfolk  virginia and its affiliates 
the addition of these vessels represented a increase in our aggregate barrel carrying capacity at the time of acquisition 
the purchase price of million excluding acquisition related costs  included a water treatment facility in norfolk  virginia 
the transaction was financed using our available credit lines  and the purchase price was allocated to the individual assets acquired based on independent appraisals 
definitions in order to understand our discussion of our results of operations  it is important to understand the meaning of the following terms used in our analysis and the factors that influence our results of operations voyage revenue 
voyage revenue includes revenue from time charters  contracts of affreightment and voyage charters  where we  as vessel operator  pay the vessel operating expenses 
voyage revenue is impacted by changes in charter and utilization rates and by the mix of business among the types of contracts described in the preceding sentence 
voyage expenses 
voyage expenses include items such as fuel  port charges  pilot fees  tank cleaning costs and canal tolls  which are unique to a particular voyage 
depending on the form of contract and customer preference  voyage expenses may be paid directly by customers or by us 
if we pay voyage expenses  they are included in our results of operations when they are incurred 
typically when we pay voyage expenses  we add them to our freight rates at an approximate cost 
net voyage revenue 
net voyage revenue is equal to voyage revenue less voyage expenses 
as explained above  the amount of voyage expenses we incur for a particular contract depends upon the form of the contract 
therefore  in comparing revenues between reporting periods  we use net voyage revenue to improve the comparability of reported revenues that are generated by the different forms of contracts 
since net voyage revenue is a non gaap measurement  it is reconciled to the nearest gaap measurement  voyage revenue  under results of operations below 
bareboat charter and other revenue 
bareboat charter and other revenue includes revenue from bareboat charters and from towing and other miscellaneous services 
vessel operating expenses 
the most significant direct vessel operating expenses are wages paid to vessel crews  routine maintenance and repairs and marine insurance 
we may also incur outside towing expenses during periods of peak demand and in order to maintain our operating capacity while our tugs are drydocked or otherwise out of service for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance 
depreciation and amortization 
we incur fixed charges related to the depreciation of the historical cost of our fleet and the amortization of expenditures for drydockings 
the aggregate number of drydockings undertaken in a given period  the size of the vessels and the nature of the work performed determine the level of drydocking expenditures 
we capitalize expenditures incurred for drydocking and amortize these expenditures over months 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of employment costs of shoreside staff and the cost of facilities  as well as legal  audit  insurance and other administrative costs 
total tank vessel days 
total tank vessel days is equal to the number of calendar days in the period multiplied by the total number of tank vessels operating or in drydock during that period 
scheduled drydocking days 
scheduled drydocking days are days designated for the inspection and survey of tank vessels  and identification and completion of required refurbishment work  as required by the us coast guard and the american bureau of shipping to maintain the vessels qualification to work in the us coastwise trade 
generally  drydockings are required twice every five years and last between and days  based upon the size of the vessel and the type and extent of work required 
net utilization 
net utilization is a primary measure of operating performance in our business 
net utilization is a percentage equal to the total number of days worked by a tank vessel or group of tank vessels during a defined period  divided by total tank vessel days for that tank vessel or group of tank vessels 
net utilization is adversely impacted by scheduled drydocking  scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and idle time not paid for by the customer 
average daily rate 
average daily rate  another key measure of our operating performance  is equal to the net voyage revenue earned by a tank vessel or group of tank vessels during a defined period  divided by the total number of days actually worked by that tank vessel or group of tank vessels during that period 
fluctuations in average daily rates result not only from changes in charter rates charged to our customers  but also from changes in vessel utilization and efficiency  which could result from internal factors  such as newer and more efficient tank vessels  and from external factors such as weather or other delays 
coastwise and local trades 
our business is segregated into coastwise trade and local trade 
our coastwise trade generally comprises voyages of between and  miles by vessels with greater than  barrels of barrel carrying capacity 
these voyages originate from the middle atlantic states to points as far north as canada and as far south as cape hatteras and from points within the gulf coast region to other points within that region or to the northeast 
we also own a non jones act tank barge that transports petroleum products internationally 
our local trade generally comprises voyages by smaller vessels of less than miles 
the term us coastwise trade  as used generally for jones act purposes  would include our coastwise and local trades

increases totaling million in coastwise net voyage revenue in fiscal resulted from an increase in days worked by the following vessels during fiscal as compared to fiscal the dbl  which was placed in service in january  the dbl  which was purchased in january  the dbl  which completed its modification for petroleum transportation and was placed in service in may  the dbl  which completed its double hull retrofitting in september  and the return of the ktc from bareboat charter in november these increases were partially offset by an aggregate million decrease in net voyage revenue during fiscal resulting from the sale of the ktc in april in anticipation of its opa phase out  and the opa phase out of the ktc and ktc in december coastwise net voyage revenue also benefited from a increase in average daily rates to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the fiscal year ended june   which accounted for approximately million of increased net voyage revenue 
average daily rates were positively impacted by the continuing strong demand for petroleum products  increasing oil prices  and the addition of the several larger vessels described above  which generate higher average daily rates 
net voyage revenue in our local trade for the fiscal year ended june  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was mainly attributable to the barges acquired as part of our december vessel acquisition  which accounted for million of the increase 
net utilization in our local trade was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  net utilization in fiscal was adversely impacted by higher unscheduled repair days for one of our small tankers and by low utilization on certain tank barges acquired in the december vessel acquisition 
average daily rates in our local trade improved slightly to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the fiscal year ended june  bareboat charter and other revenue bareboat charter and other revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  amounts for the fiscal period increased by million due to revenue generated from chartering out of a chartered in barge 
vessel operating expenses vessel operating expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  vessel operating expenses as a percentage of net voyage revenue increased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  vessel labor and related costs increased as a result of contractual labor rate increases and a higher average number of employees due to the operation of the additional barges described under net voyage revenue above  an additional tugboat purchased in january  and integration of the additional vessels purchased in december insurance costs and vessel repairs and supplies also increased as a result of the operation of the larger number of vessels 
outside towing expense increased by million due to the need for additional tugboats to satisfy increased demand for our tank vessels  and to replace certain of our tugboats during coupling and re powering projects 
fiscal vessel operating expenses also increased by million for charter costs in connection with the bareboat charter revenue discussed above in bareboat charter and other revenue 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase resulted from additional depreciation on our newbuild and purchased vessels described above  plus additional depreciation recorded in the first quarter of fiscal to reduce the salvage value for the two single hull vessels which phased out on december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to general and administrative expenses of million for the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of net voyage revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the fiscal year ended june  included million of additional professional fees and other costs incurred in connection with being a public company 
these increased professional fees included million in costs for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and million of costs incurred in fiscal to provide income tax compliance information to our unitholders  neither of which were incurred in the prior year s period 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million for the fiscal year ended june   million lower than the fiscal year ended june  the decrease resulted from the significant reduction of higher cost borrowings in connection with the repayment of debt using the proceeds of our initial public offering in january loss on reduction of debt in connection with the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and repayment of certain term loans in march as described below in liquidity and capital resources credit agreement and other term loans  we incurred million in loss on reduction of debt 
included in this amount was million in deferred financing costs related to the repaid debt that were written off  and million of prepayment costs 
in connection with our initial public offering in fiscal  million in predecessor company debt was repaid 
included in this amount was million in prepayment and make whole amounts  of which million had previously been accrued by our predecessor as supplemental interest that would have been payable upon maturity of certain of these loans  resulting in a loss on prepayment of million 
in addition  million in deferred financing costs related to the debt was also written off 
provision benefit for income taxes for fiscal  our effective tax rate was  as compared to exclusive of the benefit discussed in the following paragraph in fiscal the periods prior to our initial public offering on january  relate to our predecessor 
our effective tax rate comprises the new york city unincorporated business tax on our operating partnership  plus federal  state  local and foreign corporate income taxes on the taxable income of the operating partnership s corporate subsidiaries 
our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june  was lower than the rate for the fiscal year ended june  because a smaller portion of our pretax income was provided by our operating partnership s corporate subsidiaries 
certain net assets contributed to us in connection with our january initial public offering were transferred by our predecessor s corporate subsidiaries 
these net assets had tax bases that were lower than their carrying value for financial reporting purposes  which resulted in deferred tax liabilities relating to these temporary differences 
upon transfer to us  the future reversal of these differences will be subject to our effective tax rate  which is significantly lower than the effective tax rate of our predecessor s corporate subsidiaries 
the effect of the change in tax rates applicable to these differences is reflected as a one time deferred tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended june  net income net income was million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of million compared to net income of million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease resulted primarily from recognition in the period of the million deferred tax benefit described in the preceding paragraph  partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense  net  a million decrease in loss on reduction of debt  and a million increase in operating income 
fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  net voyage revenue voyage revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to voyage revenue of million for the fiscal year ended june  voyage expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to voyage expenses of million for the fiscal year ended june  net voyage revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to net voyage revenue of million for the fiscal year ended june  our coastwise trade net voyage revenue increased by approximately million 
this increase is primarily due to the addition of two new vessels  the dbl and dbl  which were delivered in june and january  respectively  the acquisition of the dbl in january  and the delivery  after modification  of the dbl in may these vessel additions were partially offset by the phase out  as required under opa  of the single hull vessels ktc and ktc coastwise vessel utilization decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to an increase in scheduled drydocking days 
coastwise average daily rates increased  to  from  in fiscal  these average daily rates benefited from the addition of larger vessels  including the dbl and dbl described above 
net voyage revenue in our local trade increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal net utilization in our local trade improved to in fiscal from in fiscal average daily rates in our local trade improved to  per day for fiscal from  per day for the prior year  reflecting higher rates for short term work with a customer in the northeastern united states  and by higher bunkering rates 
bareboat charter and other revenue bareboat charter and other revenue was million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million in fiscal fiscal included million in revenue recorded from chartering out a chartered in barge 
also  two vessels were returned from bareboat charter in fiscal for operation by us  reducing bareboat charter revenue by million compared to fiscal vessel operating expenses vessel operating expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to vessel operating expenses of million for fiscal vessel operating expenses as a percentage of net voyage revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal vessel labor and related costs increased million as a result of a scheduled contractual wage increase for our unionized employees and a higher average number of vessel employees due to the operation of two additional tugboats  which were purchased in may and january operation of these additional tugboats also resulted in increased insurance  routine maintenance and other operating costs 
fiscal costs were increased by million in charter costs in connection with the bareboat charter revenue discussed above 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to million recorded in fiscal new vessel additions  net of retirements  added million in depreciation  while amortization of drydocking expenditures increased million 
drydocking expenditures are amortized over months 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal this increase resulted primarily from additional professional fees  insurance and other costs of million incurred in connection with being a public company which were not incurred in the prior year 
as a percentage of net voyage revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal interest expense  net interest expense  net was million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted from the significant repayment of debt using the proceeds of our initial public offering in january additionally  a portion of both the pre and post ipo debt expense resulted from debt bearing interest at a floating rate tied to day libor  which averaged for fiscal compared to for fiscal loss on reduction of debt in connection with the initial public offering  million in predecessor company debt was repaid 
included in this amount was million in prepayment and make whole amounts  of which million had previously been accrued by our predecessor as supplemental interest that would have been payable upon maturity of certain of these loans  resulting in a loss on prepayment of million 
in addition  million in deferred financing costs related to the debt was also written off 
provision benefit for income taxes for fiscal  our effective tax rate was  exclusive of the benefit discussed in the following paragraph  as compared to in fiscal the periods prior to our initial public offering on january  relate to our predecessor 
our effective tax rate comprises the new york city unincorporated business tax on our operating partnership  plus federal  state and local corporate income taxes on the taxable income of the operating partnership s corporate subsidiary 
certain net assets contributed to us were transferred by our predecessor s corporate subsidiaries 
these net assets had tax bases that were lower than their carrying values for financial reporting purposes  which resulted in deferred tax liabilities relating to these temporary differences 
upon transfer to us  the future reversal of these differences will be subject to our effective tax rate  which is significantly lower than the effective tax rate of our predecessor s corporate subsidiaries 
the effect of the change in tax rates applicable to these differences is reflected as a deferred tax benefit of million in fiscal net income net income was million for fiscal  an increase of million compared to million in fiscal this increase resulted from the million deferred tax benefit discussed in the preceding paragraph  the increased net voyage revenue of million  and the decrease in interest expense  net of million  offset by the million loss on reduction of debt  increased operating expenses of million  increased depreciation and amortization of million  increased general and administrative expenses of million  and the decrease in bareboat charter and other revenue of million 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase of million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  resulted primarily from the improved operating results  after adjusting for non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization  and a million positive impact from changes in operating working capital 
this positive impact resulted mainly from increased accounts payable due to increased operating costs of a larger fleet  partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses such as fuel supplies and insurance premiums 
the increase of million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  resulted primarily from increased net voyage revenue  partially offset by increases in vessel operating and general and administrative expenses 
the improved revenue in fiscal also resulted in an increase in accounts receivable  which provided an offsetting reduction in cash provided by operating activities 
investing cash flows 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary elements of these activities were vessel acquisitions  construction of new vessels and retrofitting of existing ones  and the drawdown of title xi escrow funds during the vessel construction period 
we spent million  million and million on vessel acquisitions in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal acquisitions included the vessels acquired in december and the dbl  which was acquired in june construction expenditures for our tank vessel newbuilding program and rebuilding projects totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal other capital expenditures of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal related primarily to repowering of  and installation of coupling systems on  certain tugboats  and expenditures related to upgrading the vessels acquired in december capital expenditures made in the normal course of business are generally financed by cash from operations and  where necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
in fiscal  we invested the net proceeds of million from our title xi borrowings in short term us government obligations 
these proceeds were held in escrow and then drawn down by us upon delivery of the four tank barges being financed and used to repay construction period borrowings made under our revolving credit agreement 
we made million and million of such drawdowns from our title xi escrow account in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fourth and final tank vessel in this newbuilding program was delivered in january the final million of escrow funds were left on deposit and are available to the maritime administration of the us department of administration marad in connection with the restructuring of our financial agreement for the title xi bonds at the time of our initial public offering 
under this agreement  we are required to make monthly reserve fund deposits which are used to make semi annual debt service payments 
such deposits  which are reflected in net cash provided by financing activities  were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for more information  please read title xi borrowings below 
financing cash flows 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal during fiscal  we increased our credit line borrowings and term loans by a net of million  primarily to finance vessel acquisitions 
we also paid million in distributions to our unitholders in fiscal in march  we signed a new five year million credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
see credit agreement below 
the new credit agreement replaced our then existing million credit agreement  which was repaid and terminated 
on june   we issued and sold  common units in a private placement for gross proceeds of million 
during fiscal  we completed our initial public offering and used the gross proceeds thereof to pay down term loans and credit line borrowings  including prepayment costs  that had been contributed to us by our predecessor  to pay underwriting fees  professional fees and other offering expenses  and to redeem the  common units received by our predecessor in connection with the transfer of net assets to us concurrent with the initial public offering 
also in fiscal  we entered into million of new term loans to finance the purchase of the dbl lincoln sea and the dbl rebuilding project 
finally  we paid million in distributions to partners in fiscal in fiscal  we repaid million of term loans and million of credit line borrowings and paid million in financing costs  primarily attributable to our initial public offering 
oil pollution act of tank vessels are subject to the requirements of opa opa mandates that all single hull tank vessels operating in us waters be removed from petroleum and petroleum product transportation services at various times through january   and provides a schedule for the phase out of the single hull vessels based on their age and size 
one single hull vessel  renamed the dbl  was retrofitted to double hull and redelivered to us in september to replace the operating capacity of four single hull vessels that phased out at varying times from december to december  we entered into a contract with bollinger gretna  llc in march for the construction of four double hull tank barges to be built over three years 
the aggregate cost of these four vessels  which have all been delivered  was approximately million  including financing and other costs and certain special equipment 
these new tank barges were coupled with tugboats we own  using an articulated connection system  to create integrated tug barge units that provide increased operating efficiency and enhanced safety and reliability 
we financed the purchase of the four new tank vessels through the issuance of title xi bonds described below under title xi borrowings 
at june   approximately of the barrel carrying capacity of our tank vessel fleet was double hulled in compliance with opa  and the remainder will be in compliance with opa until january ongoing capital expenditures 
marine transportation of refined petroleum products is a capital intensive business  requiring significant investment to maintain an efficient fleet and to stay in regulatory compliance 
we estimate that  over the next five years  we will spend an average of approximately million per year to drydock and maintain our tank vessels operating capacity 
we expect such expenditures to approximate million in fiscal in addition  we anticipate that we will spend million annually for other general capital expenditures 
periodically  we also make expenditures to acquire or construct additional tank vessel capacity and or to upgrade our overall fleet efficiency 
for a further discussion of maintenance and expansion capital expenditures  please read footnote to the table in selected financial data in item of this report 
the following table summarizes total maintenance capital expenditures  including drydocking expenditures  and expansion capital expenditures for the periods presented in thousands years ended june  maintenance capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures including vessel acquisitions total capital expenditures construction of tank vessels in september  we signed an agreement with a shipyard to construct a new  barrel tank barge  which is expected to be delivered during the fall of the total cost  after addition of certain special equipment and integration with an existing tugboat  is expected to be in the range of to million 
we also signed an agreement with the same shipyard in february to construct two new  barrel tank barges that are expected to be delivered during the first calendar quarter of and which are expected to cost  in the aggregate and after the addition of certain special equipment  in the range of to million 
in august  we signed another agreement with that shipyard to construct another new  barrel tank barge that we expect will be delivered in the summer of and which is expected to cost  after the addition of certain special equipment  in the range of to million 
we expect to finance these newbuildings from borrowings and cash from operations 
additionally  we intend to retire or retrofit single hull tank vessels by december  which at june  represented approximately of our barrel carrying capacity 
we estimate that the current cost to replace this capacity with newbuildings and by retrofitting certain of our existing vessels would range from million to million 
this capacity can also be replaced by acquiring existing double hull tank vessels as opportunities arise 
we are currently evaluating the most cost effective means to replace this capacity 
liquidity needs 
our primary short term liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements  distributions to unitholders  and drydocking expenditures while our long term liquidity needs are primarily associated with expansion and other maintenance capital expenditures 
expansion capital expenditures are primarily for the purchase of vessels  while maintenance capital expenditures include drydocking expenditures and the cost of replacing tank vessel operating capacity 
our primary sources of funds for our short term liquidity needs are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility  while our long term sources of funds are cash from operations  long term bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings 
we believe that cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement  described under credit agreement below  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next months 
credit agreement 
in march  we entered into a new five year million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the new credit agreement replaced our then existing million revolving credit agreement  which was repaid and terminated 
the new credit agreement contains a million sublimit for letters of credit and allows us to request an increase in the total availability under the new credit agreement by up to million  to a maximum of million  so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 
obligations under the new credit agreement are secured by a first priority security interest  subject to permitted liens  on certain of our vessels having an orderly liquidation value at least equal to the greater of a million and b times the amount of the obligations including letters of credit outstanding under the new credit agreement 
interest rates on outstanding borrowings and commitment fees are determined quarterly based upon the ratio of total funded debt as defined in the new credit agreement to ebitda as defined in the new credit agreement and are determined according to whether the loan is based on the london interbank offered rate a libor based loan or on a rate per annum equal to the greater of a the bank s prime rate  or b in excess of the federal funds effective rate a base rate loan 
the following table summarizes the rates of interest and commitment fees under the new credit agreement ratio of total funded debt to ebitda libor margin base rate margin commitment fee less than greater than or equal to and less than greater than or equal to and less than greater than or equal to and less than greater than or equal to interest on a base rate loan is payable monthly over the five year term of the agreement 
interest on a libor based loan is due  at our election  one  two  three or six months after such loan is made 
outstanding principal amounts are due upon termination of the agreement 
loan proceeds under the new credit agreement may be used for any purpose in the ordinary course of business  including vessel acquisitions  ongoing working capital needs and distributions 
amounts borrowed and repaid may be re borrowed 
borrowings made for working capital purposes must be reduced to zero for a period of at least consecutive days once each year 
the new credit agreement contains covenants that are similar to  but generally more favorable than  the prior revolving credit agreement 
these covenants include  among others the maintenance of the following financial ratios all as defined in the new credit agreement a fixed charges to ebitda of at least to  b total funded debt to tangible capitalization of no greater than to  and c total funded debt to ebitda of no more than to restrictions on creating liens on or disposing of the vessels securing the new credit agreement  subject to permitted exceptions  restrictions on merging and selling assets outside the ordinary course of business  prohibitions on making distributions to limited or general partners of ours during the continuance of an event of default  and restrictions on transactions with affiliates and materially changing our business 
the new credit agreement contains customary events of default 
if a default occurs and is continuing  we must repay all amounts outstanding thereunder

to finance the rebuilding of the dbl and the retrofitting of the dbl  we entered into an agreement with a financial institution in may to provide million of term loans to permanently finance these vessels upon completion of the respective projects 
these term loans were repaid upon closing of the new credit agreement and new term loan as described above 
title xi borrowings 
to provide permanent financing for the four tank vessels built under our recently completed newbuilding program  we applied for and received from the maritime administration of the us department of transportation  or marad  a guarantee of obligations for mortgage financing pursuant to title xi of the merchant marine act of under this program  the long term financing for these four new tank vessels is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the united states of america  which is collateralized by the tank vessels being constructed and certain other agreements 
the guarantee amount of million is equal to of the marad approved cost of construction of the four tank vessels  which includes qualifying financing costs 
we refer to our obligations relating to this financing as our title xi borrowings 
on june   we privately placed million of bonds title xi bonds  which were guaranteed by marad 
the proceeds of million  net of certain closing fees  were deposited in an escrow account with the us department of the treasury and were invested in us government obligations 
the bonds were issued in four series and bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of per year 
each series is repayable over years beginning six months after the delivery date of the related tank vessel 
on july   february   june   and january   respectively  the delivery dates of the four tank barges  we drew down the portion of the escrow account relating to the particular vessel 
principal repayment of these bonds  excluding interest  will total million for fiscal and for each fiscal year thereafter until the debt is repaid 
the agreements with marad governing the title xi borrowing guarantees are collateralized by a first priority security interest  subject to permitted liens  on the four title xi vessels 
in addition  throughout the term of the title xi bonds  we will cause additional funds in the aggregate sum of million to be made available to the us secretary of transportation the secretary in the form of one or more letters of credit and or additional cash deposits million minimum for cash deposits to the escrow account that we maintain pursuant to the terms of the title xi agreements 
we are obligated under the financial agreement with marad to escrow on a monthly basis one sixth of the next semi annual debt service payment due for each series of the title xi bonds  which deposits are used to make such semi annual payments 
we have also granted marad first priority security interests in additional vessels having an orderly liquidation value of million 
the financial agreements relating to the title xi bonds enable us to make distributions of our available cash in accordance with the terms of our partnership agreement  except under any of the following circumstances  in which case distributions would require the written consent of the secretary failure to pay any principal  interest  fees  expenses or other amounts on the title xi bonds or related obligations when due  failure to observe any agreement  security instrument  obligation  representation  warranty or covenant included in the agreements with respect to the title xi bonds  bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us  the operating partnership or any of our subsidiaries  or exceeding million in indebtedness incurred for the purpose of making distributions or indemnity payments to our predecessor and certain of its affiliates

the offer and sale of the common units was made pursuant to an exemption from registration under section of the securities act of  as amended 
tortoise has agreed not to sell any of the common units until december  in connection with its purchase of common units  we entered into a registration rights agreement with tortoise 
pursuant to this agreement  we filed a shelf registration statement on august  for the resale of the common units  and we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shelf registration statement to be declared effective by the securities and exchange commission by january  in addition  we granted tortoise certain piggyback registration rights in the registration rights agreement 
we used the net proceeds to repay indebtedness incurred under our revolving credit facility in connection with our december vessel acquisition 
contractual obligations and contingencies 
our contractual obligations at june  consisted of the following in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations capital expenditures relating to shipyard payments for the construction of a new  barrel double hull tank barge and two new  barrel double hull tank barges 
the executive officers of k sea general partner gp llc have entered into employment agreements with k sea transportation inc  our indirect wholly owned corporate subsidiary 
each of the employment agreements had an initial term of one year 
the term of each employment agreement is automatically extended for successive one year terms unless either party gives days written notice prior to the end of the term that such party desires not to renew the employment agreement 
the employment agreements currently provide for an aggregate base annual salary of  in addition  each employee is eligible to receive an annual bonus award based upon our consolidated financial performance 
if the employee s employment is terminated without cause or if the employee resigns for good reason  the employee will be entitled to severance in an amount equal to the greater of a the product of multiplied by

we are a party to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business for monetary relief arising principally from personal injuries  collision or other casualty and to claims arising under vessel charters 
all of these personal injury  collision and casualty claims are fully covered by insurance  subject to deductibles ranging from  to  we accrue on a current basis for estimated deductibles we expect to pay 
ew transportation llc and its predecessors have been named  together with a large number of other companies  as co defendants in civil actions by various parties  including former employees  alleging unspecified damages from past exposure to asbestos and second hand smoke aboard some of the vessels that it contributed to us in connection with our initial public offering 
ew transportation llc and its predecessors have been dismissed from of these lawsuits for an aggregate sum of approximately  and are seeking to settle the other case 
we may be subject to litigation in the future involving these plaintiffs and others alleging exposure to asbestos due to alleged failure to properly encapsulate friable asbestos or remove friable asbestos on our vessels  as well as for exposure to second hand smoke and other matters 
ew transportation corp  a predecessor to our partnership  and many other marine transportation companies operating in new york  have come under audit with respect to the new york state petroleum business tax pbt  which is a tax on vessel fuel consumed while operating in new york state territorial waters 
the boundaries of these waters have never been defined 
an industry group in which we and ew transportation corp 
participate has proposed to the new york taxing authority that it adopt a calculation methodology for the pbt that it has applied  for purposes of a different tax  for many years 
the taxing authority has not yet responded to this proposal 
we have begun filing monthly tax returns  and have accrued our estimated liability using the industry s proposed calculation methodology 
in accordance with the agreements entered into in connection with our initial public offering  any liability resulting from the pbt prior to january  the effective date of the initial public offering is a retained liability of our predecessor 
inflation during the last three years  inflation has had a relatively minor effect on our financial results 
our contracts generally contain escalation clauses whereby certain cost increases  including labor and fuel  can be passed through to our customers 
related party transactions we lease our office and pier facilities from  and charter certain vessels to  affiliates of an employee 
additionally  we utilize one of these affiliates for tank cleaning services 
please read note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
ksp investors a lp  ksp investors b lp  and ksp investors c lp and their controlled affiliates have agreed to indemnify us for claims associated with certain retained liabilities 
for more information regarding the indemnification obligations and other related party transactions  please read certain relationships and related transactions in item of this report 
seasonality we operate our tank vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and  as a result  in charter rates 
movements of clean oil products  such as motor fuels  generally increase during the summer driving season 
movements of black oil products and distillates  such as heating oil  generally increase during the winter months  while movements of asphalt products generally increase in the spring through fall months 
unseasonably cold winters result in significantly higher demand for heating oil in the northeastern united states  which is a significant market for our tank barge services 
the summer driving season can increase demand for automobile fuel and  accordingly  the demand for our services 
a decline in demand for  and level of consumption of  refined petroleum products  particularly in the east coast and gulf coast regions  could cause demand for tank vessel capacity and charter rates to decline  which would decrease our revenues and profitability 
critical accounting policies the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is governed by generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and  in certain circumstances  requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
we base our estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and known facts that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment 
revenue recognition we earn revenue under contracts of affreightment  voyage charters  time charters and bareboat charters 
for contracts of affreightment and voyage charters  revenue is recognized based upon the relative transit time in each period  with expenses recognized as incurred 
although contracts of affreightment and certain contracts for voyage charters may be effective for a period in excess of one year  revenue is recognized over the transit time of individual voyages  which are generally less than ten days in duration 
for time charters and bareboat charters  revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period  with expenses recognized as incurred 
estimated losses on contracts of affreightment and charters are accrued when such losses become evident 
depreciation vessels and equipment are recorded at cost  including capitalized interest where appropriate  and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets as follows tank vessels ten to twenty five years  tugboats twenty years  and pier and office equipment five years 
for single hull tank vessels  these useful lives are limited to the remaining period of operation prior to mandatory retirement as required by opa also included in vessels are drydocking expenditures that are capitalized and amortized over three years 
major renewals and betterments of assets are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the assets 
maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the assets are expensed 
to date  our experience confirms that these policies are reasonable  although there may be events or changes in circumstances in the future that indicate the recovery of the carrying amount of a vessel might not be possible 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate that the recoverability of a vessel s carrying amount should be assessed might include a change in regulations such as opa  or continued operating losses  or projections thereof  associated with a vessel or vessels 
if events or changes in circumstances as set forth above indicate that a vessel s carrying amount may not be recoverable  we would then be required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the vessel  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value exceeds its fair value by appraisal 
our assumptions and estimates would include  but not be limited to  the estimated fair market value of the assets and their estimated future cash flows  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service of the asset and estimated salvage values 
although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
amortization of drydocking expenditures drydocking expenditures are capitalized and amortized over three years 
drydocking of vessels is required by both the us coast guard and by the applicable classification society  which in our case is the american bureau of shipping 
such drydocking activities include  but are not limited to  the inspection  refurbishment and replacement of steel  engine components  tailshafts  mooring equipment and other parts of the vessel 
amortization of drydocking expenditures is included in depreciation and amortization expense 
accounts receivable we extend credit to our customers in the normal course of business 
we regularly review our accounts  estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables each period  and establish an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to our trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of our customers 
deferred income taxes we provide deferred taxes for the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates in effect in the jurisdictions where we operate for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided  if necessary  for deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized

risk factors limited partner interests are inherently different from the capital stock of a corporation  although many of the business risks to which we are subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation engaged in a similar business 
unitholders should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information included elsewhere in this report 
we may not have sufficient cash from operations to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution following establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses  including payments to our general partner 
we may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to pay the minimum quarterly distribution 
the amount of cash we can distribute on our common units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations  which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the level of consumption of refined petroleum products in the markets in which we operate  the prices we obtain for our services  the level of our operating costs  including payments to our general partner  and prevailing economic conditions 
additionally  the actual amount of cash we have available for distribution depends on other factors such as the level of capital expenditures we make  including for acquisitions  retrofitting of vessels and compliance with new regulations  the restrictions contained in our debt instruments and our debt service requirements  fluctuations in our working capital needs  our ability to make working capital borrowings  and the amount  if any  of reserves  including reserves for future capital expenditures and other matters  established by our general partner in its discretion 
the amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily on our cash flow  including cash flow from operations and working capital borrowings  and not solely on profitability  which will be affected by non cash items 
as a result  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net income 
our business would be adversely affected if we failed to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade  or if those provisions were modified  repealed or waived 
we are subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between points in the united states to vessels built and registered in the united states and owned and manned by us citizens 
we are responsible for monitoring the ownership of our common units and other partnership interests 
if we do not comply with these restrictions  we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in us coastwise trade  and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer  resulting in severe penalties  including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels  fines or forfeiture of the vessels 
for information about the jones act and other maritime laws  please read regulation coastwise laws in items and of this report 
during the past several years  interest groups have lobbied congress to repeal the jones act to facilitate foreign flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for us flag vessels under the jones act and cargo preference laws 
we believe that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the jones act and cargo preference laws currently benefiting us flag vessels 
if these efforts are successful  it could result in increased competition  which could reduce our revenues and cash available for distribution 
the secretary of the department of homeland security is vested with the authority and discretion to waive the coastwise laws to such extent and upon such terms as he may prescribe whenever he deems that such action is necessary in the interest of national defense 
in response to the effects of hurricane katrina  on september  the secretary of the department of homeland security waived the coastwise laws generally for the transportation of petroleum products until september  and further waived the coastwise laws generally for the transportation of petroleum released from the strategic petroleum reserve undertaken in response to circumstances arising from hurricane katrina 
any waiver of the coastwise laws  whether in response to natural disasters or otherwise  could result in increased competition  which could reduce our revenues and cash available for distribution 
we must make substantial expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of our fleet  which will reduce our cash available for distribution 
we must make substantial capital expenditures  including drydocking expenses and the replacement or retrofitting of our single hull vessels under opa  to maintain the operating capacity of our fleet 
we currently expect to spend an average of million per year in drydocking and other general capital expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of our fleet  excluding any additional drydocking and other general capital expenditures that would be required if our acquisition of sea coast towing  inc is consummated 
prior to january   we intend to retire or retrofit single hull vessels  which represents approximately of our barrel carrying capacity as of june  we estimate that the current cost to replace this capacity with newbuildings and by retrofitting certain of our existing vessels ranges from million to million 
this capacity can also be replaced by acquiring existing double hull tank vessels as opportunities arise 
at the time we make these expenditures  the actual cost could be higher due to inflation and other factors 
please read in calculating our available cash from operating surplus each quarter  we are required to deduct estimated maintenance capital expenditures  which may result in less cash available for distribution to unitholders than if actual maintenance capital expenditures were deducted for information about our requirement to deduct estimated maintenance capital expenditures in calculating our available cash from operating surplus 
in calculating our available cash from operating surplus each quarter  we are required to deduct estimated maintenance capital expenditures  which may result in less cash available for distribution to unitholders than if actual maintenance capital expenditures were deducted 
our partnership agreement requires us to deduct estimated maintenance capital expenditures from operating surplus each quarter  as opposed to actual maintenance capital expenditures  in order to reduce disparities in operating surplus caused by the fluctuating level of maintenance capital expenditures  such as drydocking 
because of the substantial capital expenditures we intend to make by january  to replace the operating capacity of our single hull vessels  our annual estimated maintenance capital expenditures for purposes of calculating operating surplus also includes million to reduce the fluctuation in operating surplus that would otherwise be caused by the required expenditures 
the amount of estimated maintenance capital expenditures we deduct from operating surplus is subject to review and change by the board of directors of k sea general partner gp llc  with the concurrence of the conflicts committee of such board 
in years when estimated maintenance capital expenditures are higher than actual maintenance capital expenditures  as we expect will be the case in some years until we actually make expenditures for the opa replacements and retrofitting  the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders will be lower than if actual maintenance capital expenditures were deducted from operating surplus 
please read we must make substantial expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of our fleet  which will reduce our cash available for distribution for information regarding substantial expenditures that we must make to maintain the operating capacity of our fleet 
capital expenditures and other costs necessary to operate and maintain a vessel vary depending on the age of the vessel and changes in governmental regulations  safety or other equipment standards 
capital expenditures and other costs necessary to operate and maintain a vessel increase with the age of the vessel 
in addition  changes in governmental regulations  safety or other equipment standards  as well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self regulatory organizations and customer requirements or competition  may require us to make additional expenditures 
for example  we may be required to make significant expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment to satisfy requirements of the us coast guard and the american bureau of shipping 
in addition  we may be required to take our vessels out of service for extended periods of time  with corresponding losses of revenues  in order to make such alterations or to add such equipment 
in the future  market conditions may not justify these expenditures or enable us to operate our older vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives 
in order to fund these capital expenditures  we will either incur borrowings or raise capital through the sale of debt or equity securities 
our ability to access the capital markets for future offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time as well as by adverse market conditions resulting from  among other things  general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control 
our failure to obtain the funds for necessary future capital expenditures would limit our ability to continue to operate some of our vessels and could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our ability to make distributions to unitholders 
a decline in demand for  and level of consumption of  refined petroleum products  particularly in the east coast and gulf coast regions  could cause demand for tank vessel capacity and charter rates to decline  which would decrease our revenues and profitability 
the demand for tank vessel capacity is influenced by the demand for refined petroleum products and other factors including global and regional economic and political conditions  developments in international trade  changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns  including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported  environmental concerns  and competition from alternative sources of energy  such as natural gas  and alternate transportation methods 
any of these factors could adversely affect the demand for tank vessel capacity and charter rates 
any decrease in demand for tank vessel capacity or decrease in charter rates could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we operate our tank vessels in the east coast and gulf coast regions  markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and  as a result  in charter rates 
movements of certain clean oil products  such as motor fuels  generally increase during the summer driving season 
movements of black oil products and certain clean oil products  such as heating oil  generally increase during the winter months  while movements of asphalt products generally increase in the spring through fall months 
unseasonably mild winters can result in significantly lower demand for heating oil in the northeastern united states  which is a significant market for our tank barge services 
in addition  unpredictable weather patterns and variations in oil reserves disrupt vessel scheduling 
seasonality could materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations in the future 
marine transportation is an inherently risky business 
our vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as marine disasters  bad weather  mechanical failures  grounding  fire  explosions and collisions  human error  and war and terrorism 
all of these hazards can result in death or injury to persons  loss of property  environmental damages  delays or rerouting 
if one of our vessels were involved in an accident  with the potential risk of environmental contamination  the resulting media coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
please read legal proceedings in item of this report 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover our losses 
we may not be adequately insured to cover losses from our operational risks  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
for example  a catastrophic oil spill or other disaster could exceed our insurance coverage 
in addition  our affiliate  ew transportation llc  and its predecessors may not have insurance coverage prior to march if we were subject to claims related to that period  including claims from current or former employees  ew transportation llc may not have insurance to pay the liabilities  if any  that could be imposed on us 
if we had to pay claims solely out of our own funds  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
furthermore  any claims covered by insurance would be subject to deductibles  and since it is possible that a large number of claims could be brought  the aggregate amount of these deductibles could be material 
we may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future  and some claims may not be paid 
in the past  stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution  and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable 
in addition  our insurance may be voidable by the insurers as a result of certain actions of ours 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
the loss of any of these customers could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our customers consist primarily of major oil companies  oil traders and refineries 
the portion of our revenues attributable to any single customer changes over time  depending on the level of relevant activity by the customer  our ability to meet the customer s needs and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
two customers accounted for and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues for fiscal if we were to lose either of these customers or if either of these customers significantly reduced its use of our services  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth 
a principal focus of our strategy is to continue to grow by expanding our business in the east coast and gulf coast regions and to expand into other geographic markets 
for example  we recently entered into an agreement to acquire sea coast towing  inc  which is engaged in the maritime transportation of refined petroleum products and related businesses along the west coast of the united states and alaska 
our future growth will depend upon a number of factors  some of which we can control and some of which we cannot 
these factors include our ability to identify businesses engaged in managing  operating or owning vessels for acquisitions or joint ventures  identify vessels for acquisition  consummate acquisitions or joint ventures  including our pending acquisition of sea coast towing  inc  integrate any acquired businesses or vessels successfully with our existing operations  hire  train and retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and fleet  identify new geographic markets  improve our operating and financial systems and controls  and obtain required financing for our existing and new operations 
a deficiency in any of these factors would adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows or realize other anticipated benefits 
in addition  competition from other buyers could reduce our acquisition opportunities or cause us to pay a higher price than we might otherwise pay 
we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of sea coast towing with our current operations 
in august  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire sea coast towing  inc  which operates tank barges representing approximately  barrels of capacity and tugboats along the west coast of the united states and alaska 
if we complete our acquisition of sea coast  the integration of sea coast s operations with our current operations will be a complex  time consuming and costly process 
failure to timely and successfully integrate sea coast may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the difficulties of integrating sea coast will present challenges to our management including operating a significantly larger combined company with operations in geographic areas in which we have not previously operated  managing relationships with new customers for whom we have not previously provided services  integrating personnel with diverse backgrounds and organizational cultures  experiencing operational interruptions or the loss of key employees  customers or suppliers  establishing the internal controls and procedures for the combined entity that we are required to maintain under the sarbanes oxley act of  and consolidating other corporate and administrative functions 
we will also be exposed to risks that are commonly associated with transactions similar to this acquisition  such as unanticipated liabilities and costs  some of which may be material  and diversion of management s attention 
as a result  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be fully realized  if at all 
because we obtain some of our insurance through protection and indemnity associations  we also may be subject to calls  or premiums  in amounts based not only on our own claim records  but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations 
we may be subject to calls  or premiums  in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive insurance coverage for tort liability  including pollution related liability 
our payment of these calls could result in significant expenses to us  which could reduce our profits or cause losses 
moreover  the protection and indemnity clubs and other insurance providers reserve the right to make changes in insurance coverage with little or no advance notice 
we may not be able to renew time charters  consecutive voyage charters  contracts of affreightment and bareboat charters when they expire 
we received approximately of our revenue from time charters  consecutive voyage charters  contracts of affreightment and bareboat charters during fiscal these arrangements  which are generally for periods of one year or more  may not be renewed  or if renewed  may not be renewed at similar rates 
if we are unable to obtain new charters at rates equivalent to those received under the old charters  our profitability may be adversely affected 
voyage charters may not be available at rates that will allow us to operate our vessels profitably 
during fiscal  we derived approximately of our revenue from single voyage charters 
voyage charter rates fluctuate significantly based on tank vessel availability  the demand for refined petroleum products and other factors 
increased dependence on the voyage charter market by us could result in a lower utilization of our vessels and decreased profitability 
future voyage charters may not be available at rates that will allow us to operate our vessels profitably 
our purchase of existing vessels carries risks associated with the quality of those vessels 
our fleet renewal and expansion strategy includes the acquisition of existing vessels as well as the ordering of newbuildings 
unlike newbuildings  existing vessels typically do not carry warranties with respect to their condition 
while we generally inspect any existing vessel prior to purchase  such an inspection would normally not provide us with as much knowledge of its condition as we would possess if the vessel had been built for us and operated by us during its life 
repairs and maintenance costs for existing vessels are difficult to predict and may be more substantial than for vessels we have operated since they were built 
these costs could decrease our profits and reduce our liquidity 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations  including environmental regulations  that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
increasingly stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and the manning  construction and operation of vessels significantly affect our operations 
many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the us coast guard  the national transportation safety board  the us customs service and marad  and to regulation by private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
the us coast guard and the national transportation safety board set safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
the us coast guard is authorized to inspect vessels at will 
our operations are also subject to federal  state  local and international laws and regulations that control the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection 
compliance with such laws  regulations and standards may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties  criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations 
some environmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances  which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault 
under opa  owners  operators and bareboat charterers are jointly and severally strictly liable for the discharge of oil within the mile exclusive economic zone around the united states 
additionally  an oil spill could result in significant liability  including fines  penalties  criminal liability and costs for natural resource damages 
the potential for these releases could increase as we increase our fleet capacity 
most states bordering on a navigable waterway have enacted legislation providing for potentially unlimited liability for the discharge of pollutants within their waters 
terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs and have disrupted our business 
continued hostilities in the middle east or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our results of operations 
after the terrorist attacks of september   new york harbor was shut down temporarily  resulting in the suspension of our local operations in the new york city area for four days and the loss of revenue related to these operations 
the long term impact that terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks may have on the petroleum industry in general  and on us in particular  is not known at this time 
uncertainty surrounding continued hostilities in the middle east or other sustained military campaigns may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of petroleum supplies and markets  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror 
changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain 
moreover  the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital 
we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of our services 
any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business 
all of our seagoing personnel other than tug and tanker captains  or approximately of our workforce  are employed under a contract with a division of the international longshoreman s association that expires on june  any work stoppages or other labor disturbances could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
increased competition in the domestic tank vessel industry could result in reduced profitability and loss of market share for us 
contracts for our vessels are generally awarded on a competitive basis  and competition in the markets we serve is intense 
the most important factors determining whether a contract will be awarded include availability and capability of the vessels  ability to meet the customer s schedule  price  safety record  reputation  and experience 
some of our competitors may have greater financial resources and larger operating staffs than we do 
as a result  they may be able to make vessels available more quickly and efficiently  transition to double hull barges from single hull barges more rapidly  and withstand the effects of declines in charter rates for a longer period of time 
they may also be better able to weather a downturn in the oil and gas industry 
as a result  we could lose customers and market share to these competitors 
we also face competition from refined petroleum product pipelines 
long haul transportation of refined petroleum products is generally less costly by pipeline than by tank vessel 
the construction of new pipeline segments to carry petroleum products into our markets  including pipeline segments that connect with existing pipeline systems  and the conversion of existing non refined petroleum product pipelines  could adversely affect our ability to compete in particular locations 
our employees are covered by federal laws that may subject us to job related claims in addition to those provided by state laws 
some of our employees are covered by provisions of the jones act and general maritime law 
these laws typically operate to make liability limits established by state workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and to permit these employees and their representatives to pursue actions against employers for job related injuries in federal courts 
because we are not generally protected by the limits imposed by state workers compensation statutes  we may have greater exposure for claims made by these employees 
we depend on key personnel for the success of our business 
we depend on the services of our senior management team and other key personnel 
in particular  our success depends on the continued efforts of mr 
timothy j 
casey  the president and chief executive officer of k sea general partner gp llc  and other key employees 
the loss of the services of any key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for senior management or key employees if their services were no longer available 
due to our lack of asset diversification  adverse developments in our marine transportation business would reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
we rely exclusively on the revenues generated from our marine transportation business 
due to our lack of asset diversification  an adverse development in this business would have a significantly greater impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations than if we maintained more diverse assets 
changes in international trade agreements could affect our ability to provide marine transportation services at competitive rates 
currently  vessel trade or marine transportation between two points within the same country  generally known as cabotage or coastwise trade  is not included in the general agreement on trade in services or the north american free trade agreement 
in addition  the jones act restricts maritime cargo transportation between us ports to us flag vessels qualified to engage in us coastwise trade 
if maritime services were deemed to include cabotage and included in the general agreement on trade in services  the north american free trade agreement or other multi national trade agreements  transportation of maritime cargo between us ports could be opened to foreign flag vessels 
foreign vessels would have lower construction costs and would generally operate at significantly lower costs than we do in us markets  which would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete 
k sea general partner lp and its affiliates have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary duties  which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of our unitholders 
our affiliates indirectly own the general partner interest and a limited partner interest in us and own and control the general partner of our general partner 
conflicts of interest may arise between our general partner and our affiliates  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders  on the other hand 
as a result of these conflicts  our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of our affiliates over the interests of our unitholders 
these conflicts include  among others  the following situations our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us  such as the interests of its affiliates  in resolving conflicts of interest  which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to our unitholders  our general partner may limit its liability and reduce its fiduciary duties  while also restricting the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that  without the limitations  might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty 
as a result of purchasing common units  our unitholders consent to some actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law  our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales  capital expenditures  borrowings  issuance of additional partnership securities and reserves  each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders  in some instances  our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions  even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make a distribution on the subordinated units or to make incentive distributions or to hasten the expiration of the subordination period  our general partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates  including k sea general partner gp llc  are reimbursable by us  our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf  our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it and its affiliates  and our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel  accountants or others to perform services for us 
our partnership agreement currently limits the ownership of our partnership interests by individuals or entities that are not us citizens 
this restriction could limit the liquidity of our common units 
in order to ensure compliance with jones act citizenship requirements  the board of directors of the general partner of our general partner has adopted a requirement that at least of our partnership interests must be held by us citizens 
this requirement may have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of our common units  because unitholders will be unable to sell units to non us citizens 
any purported transfer of common units in violation of these provisions will be ineffective to transfer the common units or any voting  dividend or other rights in respect of the common units 
the irs could treat us as a corporation for tax purposes  which would substantially reduce cash available for distribution to unitholders 
the federal income tax benefit of an investment in us depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
the irs has not provided any ruling on this matter 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay tax on our income at corporate rates  currently  distributions would generally be taxed again to unitholders as corporate distributions and no income  gains  losses  or deductions would flow through to unitholders 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as an entity  cash available for distribution to unitholders would be substantially reduced 
treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to unitholders and thus would likely result in a substantial reduction in the value of the common units 
current law may change and cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
our partnership agreement provides that  if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state  or local income tax purposes  the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts will be decreased to reflect the impact of that law on us 
finally  because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise and other forms of taxation 
if any of these states were to impose a tax on us  the cash available for distribution to unitholders would be reduced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our title xi bonds and one outstanding term loan bear interest at fixed interest rates ranging from to 
borrowings under our credit agreement and two outstanding term loans bear interest at a floating rate based on libor  which will subject us to increases or decreases in interest expense resulting from movements in that rate 
based on an aggregate million of floating rate debt outstanding as of june   the impact of a increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense  and a corresponding decrease in income before income taxes  of approximately million annually
