competition competition for commercial banking and other financial services is strong in the company s market areas

some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending capabilities and may offer services that the company does not currently provide 
in addition  many of the company s non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern financial holding companies and federally insured banks 
competition among financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit accounts  interest rates charged on loans and other credit and service charges  the quality and scope of the services rendered  the convenience of banking facilities and  in the case of loans to commercial borrowers  relative lending limits

the company conducts its business through its wholly owned subsidiaries  tompkins trust company  the bank of castile  mahopac national bank  and tompkins insurance 
unless the context otherwise requires  the term company refers to tompkins trustco  inc and its subsidiaries 
headquartered in ithaca  new york  tompkins is registered as a financial holding company with the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act of  as amended 
tompkins was organized in under the laws of the state of new york  as a bank holding company for tompkins trust company  a commercial bank that has operated in ithaca and surrounding communities since forward looking statements the company is making this statement in order to satisfy the safe harbor provision contained in the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this report on form k that are not statements of historical fact may include forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements are made based on management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company and are subject to certain uncertainties and factors relating to the company s operations and economic environment  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company  that could cause actual results of the company to differ materially from those matters expressed and or implied by forward looking statements 
the following factors are among those that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements changes in general economic  market and regulatory conditions  the development of an interest rate environment that may adversely affect the company s interest rate spread  other income or cash flow anticipated from the company s operations  investment and or lending activities  changes in laws and regulations affecting banks  bank holding companies and or financial holding companies  technological developments and changes  the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely  cost effective basis  governmental and public policy changes  including environmental regulation  protection and validity of intellectual property rights  reliance on large customers  and financial resources in the amounts  at the times and on the terms required to support the company s future businesses 
in addition  such forward looking statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general economic and political conditions  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations  and other factors 
critical accounting policies in the course of the company s normal business activity  management must select and apply many accounting policies and methodologies that lead to the financial results presented in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
some of these policies are more critical than others 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the reserve for loan lease losses reserve to be a critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in estimating the levels of reserve needed to cover probable credit losses within the loan portfolio and the material effect that these estimates can have on the company s results of operations 
the company has developed a methodology to measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the loan portfolio to ensure that an adequate reserve is maintained 
the methodology includes an estimate of exposure for the following specifically reviewed and graded loans  historical loss experience by product type  past due and nonperforming loans  and other internal and external factors such as local and regional economic conditions  growth trends  and credit policy and underwriting standards 
the methodology includes a review of loans considered impaired in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfaf no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as well as other commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that are evaluated using an internal rating system 
an estimated exposure amount is assigned to these internally reviewed credits based upon a review of the borrower s financial condition  payment history  collateral adequacy  and business conditions 
for commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans not specifically reviewed  and for more homogenous loan portfolios such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  estimated exposure amounts are assigned based upon historical loss experience as well as past due status 
lastly  additional reserves are maintained based upon management judgment and assessment of other quantitative and qualitative factors such as regional and local economic conditions and portfolio growth trends 
since the methodology is based upon historical experience and trends as well as management s judgment  factors may arise that result in different estimations 
significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates may include  but are not limited to  changes in economic conditions in the local area  concentration of risk  and declines in local property values 
while management s evaluation of the reserve for loan lease losses as of december   considers the reserve to be adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the company would need to increase the reserve 
all accounting policies are important and the reader of the financial statements should review these policies  described in note summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k  to gain a better understanding of how the company s financial performance is reported 
results of operations comparison of december  and results general net income for the year ended december   was up to million  compared to million in on a per share basis  the company earned per diluted share in  compared to per diluted share in the favorable performance in over reflects continued success in the execution of the company s key business strategies 
these strategies include a commitment to community banking through diversified revenue sources consisting of net interest income generated from the loan and securities portfolios  trust and investment services income  insurance commissions and fees  and other service charges and fees for providing banking and related financial services 
evidence of the success of these strategies includes the growth in total loans and the growth in core deposits total deposits less time deposits of  and more  brokered deposits  and municipal money market deposits from december  to december   as well as growth in key fee income categories as discussed below 
the low interest rate environment in and and the narrow spread between short term rates and long term rates made a challenging year

the reserve for loan lease losses management reviews the adequacy of the reserve for loan lease losses reserve on a regular basis 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the reserve to be a critical accounting policy  given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the reserve required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that assumptions could have on the company s results of operations 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the reserve and the related provision include management s approach to granting new credit  the ongoing monitoring of existing credits by the internal and external loan review functions  the growth and composition of the loan lease portfolio  comments received during the course of independent examinations  current local economic conditions  past due and nonperforming loan statistics  the impact of competition on loan structuring and pricing  the estimated values of collateral  and a historical review of loan lease loss experience 
the company has developed a methodology to measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the loan portfolio to ensure that an adequate reserve is maintained 
the methodology includes an estimate of exposure for the following specifically reviewed and graded loans  historical loss experience by product type  past due and nonperforming loans  and other internal and external factors such as local and regional economic conditions  growth trends  and credit policy and underwriting standards 
the methodology includes a review of loans considered impaired in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as well as other commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that are evaluated using an internal rating system 
an estimated exposure amount is assigned to these internally reviewed credits based upon a review of the borrower s financial condition  payment history  collateral adequacy  and business conditions 
for commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans not specifically reviewed  and for homogenous loan portfolios such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  estimated exposure amounts are assigned based upon historical loss experience  past due status  and management s judgment of the effects of recent and forecasted economic conditions on portfolio performance 
lastly  additional reserves are maintained based upon management judgment and assessment of other quantitative and qualitative factors such as regional and local economic conditions  concentrations of credit  industry concerns  adverse market changes in estimated or appraised collateral value  and portfolio growth trends 
since the methodology is based upon historical experience and trends as well as management s judgment  factors may arise that result in different estimations 
significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates may include  but are not limited to  changes in economic conditions in the local area  concentration of risk  changes in interest rates  and declines in local property values 
while management s evaluation of the reserve for loan lease losses as of december   considers the reserve to be adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the company would need to increase the reserve 
the allocation of the company s reserve as of december   and each of the previous four years is illustrated in table allocation of the reserve for loan lease losses  below 
table allocation of the reserve for loan lease losses december dollar amounts in thousands total loans outstanding at end of year      allocation of the reserve by loan type commercial      real estate      consumer and all other      unallocated    total      allocation of the reserve as a percentage of total reserve commercial real estate consumer and all other unallocated total loan lease types as a percentage of total loans leases commercial real estate consumer and all other total management is committed to early recognition of loan problems and to maintaining an adequate reserve 
the above allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge offs may occur  nor is it an indicator of future loss trends 
the allocation of the reserve to each category does not restrict the use of the reserve to absorb losses in any category 
the increase in the reserve between year end and year end reflects higher allocations due to growth in the loan portfolio and additional allocations for specifically reviewed and graded loans 
the level of future charge offs are dependent upon a variety of factors such as national and local economic conditions  trends in various industries  underwriting characteristics  and conditions unique to each borrower 
given uncertainties surrounding these factors  it is difficult to estimate future losses 
the principal balances of nonperforming loans leases  including impaired loans leases  as of december are detailed in the table below

this loss experience coupled with strong growth in the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios in were factors that influenced the provision expense in and management reviews the loan portfolio continuously for evidence of potential problem loans leases 
potential problem loans leases are loans leases that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  but where known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have doubt as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans leases as nonperforming at sometime in the future 
management considers loans leases classified as substandard  which continue to accrue interest  to be potential problem loans leases 
the company  through its internal loan review function identified commercial relationships totaling million at december   and commercial relationships totaling million at december   which it classified as substandard  which continue to accrue interest 
these loans remain in a performing status due to a variety of factors  including payment history  the value of collateral supporting the credits  and personal or government guarantees 
these factors  when considered in aggregate  give management reason to believe that the current risk exposure on these loans does not warrant classification of these loans as nonperforming 
approximately  of these loans are backed by guarantees of us government agencies 
while in a performing status as of december   these loans exhibit certain risk factors  which have the potential to cause them to become nonperforming 
accordingly  management s attention is focused on these credits  which are reviewed on at least a quarterly basis 
deposits and other liabilities total deposits of billion at december   reflected an increase of million over total deposits at december  deposit growth consisted primarily of core deposits  which increased by million  while municipal money market deposits increased by million and time deposits of  or more increased by million 
core deposit growth was fairly strong at all of the company s subsidiary banks and included growth in mature offices as well as newer offices 
offices opened after january   contributed million to the growth in  while the remaining million of growth was in offices opened prior to january  table average statements of condition and net interest analysis above shows the average balance and average rate paid on the company s primary deposit categories for the years ended december    and a maturity schedule of time deposits outstanding at december   is included in note deposits in notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the company s liability for securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements amounted to million at december   representing a million decrease from million at december  in  repurchase agreements increased by million over year end  partially as a result of the company s asset liability management strategy 
the company used these repurchase agreements to fund growth in investment securities to capitalize on the spread between the yields on the securities and the cost of the borrowings 
with the increase in short term rates and narrowing spread between short term and long term rates in  the company used investment cash flows to pay down borrowings 
the company uses both retail and wholesale repurchase agreements 
retail repurchase agreements are arrangements with local customers of the company  in which the company agrees to sell securities to the customer with an agreement to repurchase those securities at a specified later date 
retail repurchase agreements totaled million at december   and million at december  management generally views local repurchase agreements as an alternative to large time deposits 
the company s wholesale repurchase agreements are primarily with the federal home loan bank fhlb and amounted to million at december  and million at december  refer to note securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased in notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further details on the company s repurchase agreements 
the company s other borrowings include amounts owed to the fhlb 
the company reduced its other borrowings from the fhlb by million  to million at year end from million at year end given the uncertain interest rate environment in  the company used cash flow from its investment portfolio to pay down borrowings 
borrowings with the fhlb outstanding at december   included million due in one year or less  and million due in more than one year 
the weighted average interest rate on other borrowings due in more than one year was at december  refer to note other borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further details on the company s term borrowings with the fhlb 
other borrowings include a treasury tax and loan note account with the federal reserve bank of new york totaling  at december  and december  at december  and  tompkins insurance had borrowings of  and  respectively  from unrelated financial institutions 
liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of adequate funding sources to satisfy the demand for credit  deposit withdrawals  and business investment opportunities 
the company s large  stable core deposit base and strong capital position are the foundation for the company s liquidity position 
asset and liability positions are monitored primarily through asset liability management committees of the subsidiary banks individually and on a combined basis 
these committees review periodic reports on the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions 
comparisons with industry and peer groups are also monitored 
the company s strong reputation in the communities it serves  along with its strong financial condition  provide access to numerous sources of liquidity as described below 
management believes these diverse liquidity sources provide sufficient means to meet all demands on the company s liquidity that are reasonably likely to occur 
core deposits remain a key funding source  increasing by million to billion at year end from billion at year end core deposits represented of total deposits and of total liabilities at december  compared to of total deposits and of total liabilities at december  contributing to the growth in core deposits is the recent expansion of the company s branch network and a focus on demand deposit growth 
non core funding sources which include time deposits of  or more  brokered time deposits  municipal money market accounts  repurchase agreements  and other borrowings increased by million between year end and year end  from million to million 
as a percentage of total liabilities  non core funding sources decreased from at year end to at year end the increase in the dollar volume of non core funding was concentrated in time deposits of  or more 
rates on these products began to move upwards due to competitive market conditions 
the increase in time deposits of  or more was partially offset by a reduction of advances from the fhlb and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
the company used investment cash flow to pay down borrowings as the narrow spread between short term and long term rates limited favorable investment opportunities 
non core funding sources may require securities to be pledged against the underlying liability 
securities carried at million and million at december  and  respectively  were pledged as collateral for public deposits and other borrowings  and pledged or sold under agreements to repurchase 
pledged securities represented of total securities at december   compared to of total securities at december  the company s liquidity is enhanced by ready access to national and regional wholesale funding sources including federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  negotiable certificates of deposit  and fhlb advances 
through its subsidiary banks  the company has borrowing relationships with the fhlb and correspondent banks  which provide secured and unsecured borrowing capacity 
at december   the unused borrowing capacity on established lines with the fhlb was million 
as members of the fhlb  the company s subsidiary banks can use unencumbered mortgage related assets to secure additional borrowings from the fhlb 
at december   total unencumbered residential real estate assets were million 
additional assets may also qualify as collateral for fhlb advances upon approval of the fhlb 
short term investments  consisting of securities with maturities of one year or less  totaled million at year end and million at year end cash flow from the loan and investment portfolios provides a significant source of liquidity 
these assets may have stated maturities in excess of one year  but have monthly principal reductions 
total mortgage backed securities  at fair value  were million at december  compared with million at december  using current prepayment assumptions  cash flow from the investment portfolio is estimated to be approximately million in investments in residential mortgage loans  consumer loans  and leases totaled approximately million at december  aggregate amortization from monthly payments on these loan assets provides significant additional cash flow to the company

 accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop addresses accounting for differences between the contractual cash flows of certain loans and debt securities and the cash flows expected to be collected when loans or debt securities are acquired in a transfer and those cash flow differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
as such  sop applies to loans and debt securities acquired individually  in pools or as part of a business combination and does not apply to originated loans 
the application of sop limits the interest income  including accretion of purchase price discounts  that may be recognized for certain loans and debt securities 
additionally  sop does not allow the excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected to be recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual or valuation allowance  such as the allowance for possible loan losses 
sop requires that increases in expected cash flows subsequent to the initial investment be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the loan or debt security over its remaining life 
decreases in expected cash flows should be recognized as impairment 
in the case of loans acquired in a business combination where the loans show signs of credit deterioration  sop represents a significant change from current purchase accounting practice whereby the acquiree s allowance for loan losses is typically added to the acquirer s allowance for loan losses 
sop is effective for loans and debt securities acquired beginning january  the adoption of this new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk interest rate risk is the primary market risk category associated with the company s operations 
interest rate risk refers to the volatility of earnings caused by changes in interest rates 
the company manages interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in its on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the potential effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income for future periods 
each quarter the company s asset liability management committee reviews the simulation results to determine whether the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates remains within board approved levels 
the committee also discusses strategies to manage this exposure and incorporates these strategies into the investment and funding decisions of the company 
the company does not use derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  to manage its interest rate risk exposure 
table interest rate risk analysis below is a condensed static gap report  which illustrates the anticipated repricing intervals of assets and liabilities as of december  the analysis reflects sensitivity to rising rates in all repricing intervals shown 
this analysis suggests that the company s net interest income is more vulnerable to a rising rate environment than it is to sustained low interest rates 
table interest rate risk analysis condensed static gap december  repricing interval cumulative dollar amounts in thousands total months months months months interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities      net gap position     net gap position as a percentage of total assets balances of available for sale securities are shown at amortized cost 
the company s board of directors has set a policy that interest rate risk exposure will remain within a range whereby net interest income will not decline by more than in one year as a result of a basis point change in rates 
based upon the simulation analysis performed as of december   a basis point upward shift in interest rates over a one year time frame would result in a one year decline in net interest income of approximately  assuming no balance sheet growth and no management action to address balance sheet mismatches 
the same simulation indicates that a basis point decline in interest rates over a one year period would result in a decrease in net interest income of 
the negative exposure in a rising rate environment is mainly driven by the repricing assumptions of the company s core deposit base and the lag in the repricing of the company s adjustable rate assets 
longer term  the impact of a rising rate environment is positive as the asset base continues to reset at higher levels  while the repricing of the rate sensitive liabilities moderates 
the negative exposure in the basis point decline scenario results from the company s assets repricing downward more rapidly than the rates on the company s interest bearing liabilities  mainly deposits  as deposit rates are at low levels given the historically low interest rate environment over the past two years 
the aforementioned percentage changes in net interest income are from our base case scenario 
in our most recent simulation  the base case scenario  which assumes interest rates remain unchanged from the date of the simulation  showed a relatively flat net interest margin during in the present interest rate environment 
although the simulation model is useful in identifying potential exposure to interest rate movements  actual results may differ from those modeled as the repricing  maturity  and prepayment characteristics of financial instruments may change to a different degree than modeled 
in addition  the model does not reflect actions that management may employ to manage its interest rate risk exposure 
the company s current liquidity profile  capital position  and growth prospects  offer a level of flexibility for management to take actions that could offset some of the negative effects of unfavorable movements in interest rates 
management believes the current exposure to changes in interest rates is not significant in relation to the earnings and capital strength of the company additional information regarding market risk of the company s financial instruments at december  is provided in table repricing intervals of selected financial instruments below
