item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of the business our principal businesses are asset management and related research as well as the development  marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent  high net worth and institutional market segments 
we distribute our investment products and services  which include individually managed accounts  closed end exchange traded funds  and mutual funds  to the affluent and high net worth market segments through unaffiliated intermediary firms including broker dealers  commercial banks  affiliates of insurance providers  financial planners  accountants  consultants and investment advisors 
we also provide managed account services  including privately offered partnerships  to several institutional market segments and channels 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from investment advisory fees  which are recognized as services are performed 
these fees are directly related to the market value of the assets we manage 
advisory fee revenues generally will increase with a rise in the level of assets under management 
assets under management will rise through sales of our investment products or through increases in the value of portfolio investments 
assets under management may also increase as a result of reinvestment of distributions from funds and accounts  and from reinvestment of distributions from defined portfolio products we sponsored into shares of mutual funds 
fee income generally will decline when assets under management decline  as would occur when the values of fund portfolio investments decrease or when managed account withdrawals or mutual fund redemptions exceed gross sales and reinvestments 
in addition to investment advisory fees  we have two other sources of operating revenue performance fees and distribution and underwriting revenue 
performance fees are earned when investment performance on certain institutional accounts and hedge funds exceeds a contractual threshold 
these fees are recognized only at the performance measurement date contained in the individual account management agreement 
distribution revenue is earned when certain funds are sold to the public through financial advisors 
correspondingly  distribution revenue will rise and fall with the level of our sales of mutual fund products 
underwriting fees are earned on the initial public offerings of our exchange traded funds 
the level of underwriting fees earned in any given year will fluctuate depending on the number of new funds offered  the size of the funds offered and the extent to which we participate as a member of the syndicate group underwriting the fund 
sales of our products  and our profitability  are directly affected by many variables  including investor preferences for equity  fixed income or other investments  the availability and attractiveness of competing products  market performance  continued access to distribution channels  changes in interest rates  inflation  and income tax rates and laws

we ended the year with more than billion in assets under management  up billion  or for the year 
at december   our assets under management were evenly split  with of our assets in municipal products and in equity and income products 
operating revenues grew for the year to million 
fueled by higher asset levels  advisory fees grew for the year 
this growth was partially offset by a reduction in performance fees 
operating expenses for the year increased million or 
higher compensation expense accounted for the majority of the increase as we continued to invest in our investment and distribution capabilities as well as legal  compliance and administrative resources 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains important information that should be helpful in evaluating our results of operations and financial condition  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
gross sales which include new managed accounts  deposits into existing managed accounts and the sale of open end and exchange traded fund shares of investment products for the years ending december    and are shown below gross investment product sales in millions for the year ended december  managed assets exchange traded funds    mutual funds    retail managed accounts    institutional managed accounts    total managed assets    defined portfolios total    gross sales increased during to a record high billion 
growth in managed account sales was the main driver as sales of retail and institutional accounts more than doubled versus the prior year 
considerable strength in value account sales was the main driver as both retail and institutional value equity account sales more than tripled for the year 
despite rising short term interest rates  municipal account sales continued to grow  ending the year up over the previous year 
partially offsetting the increase in value equity and municipal account sales was a decline in sales of growth equity accounts 
also showing growth for the year were mutual fund sales which increased over the prior year driven by an increase in sales of equity and income funds 
sales of exchange traded products declined versus the prior year due to fewer new fund issuances in gross sales increased during  to billion 
the main drivers of the increase were retail and institutional managed account sales due to growing momentum in our value based equity strategies and continued strong growth in municipal managed accounts 
although sales of exchange traded funds declined slightly  we raised billion in new exchange traded fund assets in  with of those assets coming from taxable income and blended income and equity investment strategies 
net flows of investment products for the years ending december    and are shown below net flows in millions for the year ended december  managed assets exchange traded funds    mutual funds managed accounts   total managed assets    defined portfolios total    net flows were also at a record level in  totaling billion  an increase of versus managed account flows were particularly strong  with our value equity accounts contributing billion in flows and our municipal managed accounts another billion 
partially offsetting the positive flows were billion in growth equity account outflows 
net flows for totaled billion  with growth over the prior year primarily driven by strong value equity and municipal managed accounts 
the following table summarizes net assets under management by product type net assets under management in millions december  exchange traded funds    mutual funds    managed accounts retail    managed accounts institutional    total    excludes defined portfolio assets under surveillance

assets under management increased billion  or to over billion at december  the growth in assets under management was attributable to increases of billion or in exchange traded fund assets  billion or in mutual fund assets and billion or in managed account assets 
the increase in exchange traded fund assets was the result of billion in new assets and market appreciation of billion 
new assets of billion and market appreciation primarily equity appreciation of billion accounted for the increase in managed account assets 
we ended with assets under management of billion  higher than assets under management increased billion primarily as a result of new assets and market appreciation in both the exchange traded funds and managed accounts 
investment advisory fee income  net of sub advisory fees and expense reimbursements  is shown in the following table investment advisory fees in thousands for the year ended december  exchange traded funds    mutual funds    managed accounts    total    higher asset levels drove an increase in advisory fees for the year 
advisory fees on exchange traded funds increased while managed account fees increased 
advisory fees increased during  driven mainly by higher asset levels for both exchange traded funds and managed accounts

product distribution revenue for the years ended december   and is shown in the following table product distribution in thousands for the year ended december  exchange traded funds    muni fund preferred tm    mutual funds   defined portfolios  total    product distribution revenue remained fairly consistent with the prior year 
underwriting revenue on exchange traded funds declined million due to fewer new fund assets raised in this decline was almost completely offset by increases in mutual fund distribution revenue and munipreferredr and fundpreferredr fees 
the increase in mutual fund distribution revenue was driven by an increase in sales and a decline in commissions paid on large dollar value sales 
munipreferredr and fundpreferredr fees increased as a result of an increase in preferred shares outstanding and an increase in shares traded by non participating brokers who access the auction through the company s trading desk 
product distribution revenue in declined for the year mainly as a result of our decision to discontinue the defined portfolio product line 
performance fees other revenue performance fees other revenue consists of performance fees earned on institutional assets managed by symphony and various fees earned in connection with services provided on behalf of our defined portfolio assets under surveillance 
performance fees for were million  down from the million in performance fees in additionally  fees earned on services provided on behalf of our defined portfolio assets under surveillance declined due to an overall decline in these assets 
the increase in this area for was the result of an increase of million in symphony performance fees 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in fees earned on defined portfolio assets under surveillance as a result of a decline in the overall level of defined portfolio assets

revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 and supersedes apb opinion no 
and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services through share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  while the company currently follows sfas no 
 resulting in the recognition of option expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income  the adoption of sfas no 
r will require the use of a slightly different method of accounting for forfeitures beginning in this change in methodology will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact our financial position and results of operations 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to the understanding of our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
intangible assets at december   our assets included million of goodwill and million of other definite lived intangible assets 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate market multiples and other assumptions 
we completed the impairment testing of goodwill and determined that there was no impairment to the goodwill recorded in our books and records as of may   the date that we have selected as an annual date 
the recognition of any such impairment would have resulted in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment was determined 
while we believe that our testing was appropriate  the use of different assumptions may result in recognizing some impairment of goodwill in our financial statements 
impairment of investment securities sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and securities and exchange commission sec staff bulletin sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities and fasb emerging issues task force  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we periodically evaluate our investments for other than temporary declines in value 
to determine if an other than temporary decline exists  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  as well as our intent and ability to hold the investment 
additionally  we consider the financial health of and near term business outlook for an investee  including factors such as industry performance and operational cash flow 
if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist  the unrealized investment loss net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the following information and information included elsewhere in this report  describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risk 
interest rate sensitivity as of december   all of our long term debt was at a fixed interest rate 
however  we have periodically entered into receive fixed  pay floating interest rate swap agreements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements derivative financial instruments for further information 
these agreements effectively increased our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
however  at december   there were no open interest rate swap agreements 
a change in interest rates on our fixed debt has no impact on interest incurred or cash flow  but would have an impact on the fair value of the debt 
we estimate that a basis point increase in interest rates from the levels at december  and  would result in a net decrease in the fair value of our debt of approximately million and million  at december  and  respectively 
our investments consist primarily of company sponsored managed investment funds that invest in a variety of asset classes 
additionally  the company periodically invests in new advisory accounts incubation funds to establish a performance history prior to a potential product launch 
company sponsored funds and accounts are carried on our consolidated financial statements at fair market value and are subject to the investment performance of the underlying sponsored fund or account 
any unrealized gain or loss is recognized upon the sale of the investment 
the carrying value of the company s investments in fixed income funds or accounts  which expose us to interest rate risk  was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we estimate that a basis point increase in interest rates from the levels at december  would result in a net decrease of approximately million in the fair value of the fixed income investments at december  we estimate that a basis point movement from the levels at december   would result in an immaterial change in the fair value of the fixed income investments at december  also included in investments at december   are certain swap agreements and futures contracts that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the swap agreements are being used to re create certain fixed income indices for purposes of establishing new fixed income products that may be offered to investors in the future 
the futures contracts are being used to mitigate overall market risk related to our investments in certain newly created products described in the investments section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of these instruments totaled approximately million at december  there were no such instruments at december  we estimate that a basis point increase in interest rates from the levels at december  would result in a net decrease in the fair value of the open derivatives of million 
equity market sensitivity as discussed above in the interest rate sensitivity section  we invest in certain company sponsored managed investment funds and accounts that invest in a variety of asset classes 
the carrying value of the company s investments in funds and accounts subject to equity price risk is approximately million and million  at december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  we estimate that a adverse change in equity prices would have resulted in decreases of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair value of our equity securities 
the model to determine sensitivity assumes a corresponding shift in all equity prices 
an adverse movement in the equity prices of our holding in privately held companies cannot be easily quantified as our ability to realize returns on investment depends on the investees ability to raise additional capital and or derive cash inflows from continuing operations 
inflation our assets are  to a large extent  liquid in nature and therefore not significantly affected by inflation 
however  inflation may result in increases in our expenses  such as employee compensation  advertising and promotional costs  and office occupancy costs 
to the extent inflation  or the expectation thereof  results in rising interest rates or has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and on the value of financial instruments  it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
a substantial decline in the value of fixed income or equity investments could adversely affect the net asset value of funds and accounts we manage  which in turn would result in a decline in investment advisory and performance fee revenue
