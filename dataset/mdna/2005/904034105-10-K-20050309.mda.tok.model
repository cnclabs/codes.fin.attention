our laser thermal processing equipment is targeted at advanced annealing applications within the semiconductor industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  warranty obligations  purchase order commitments  bad debts  income taxes  intangible assets  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have reviewed these policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue from four sources system sales  spare parts sales  service contracts and license fees 
provided all other criteria are met  we recognize revenues on system sales when we have received customer acceptance of the system and have completed the system installation obligations or are otherwise released from our installation obligations 
in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance  whichever occurs first 
in these instances  revenue is recorded only if the product has met product specifications prior to shipment and management deems that no significant uncertainties as to product performance exist 
our transactions frequently include the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
in situations with multiple deliverables  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations 
consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate accounting units based on the residual method under which the revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue allocated to delivered elements  provided the undelivered elements have value on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements  the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
we generally recognize revenue from spare parts sales upon shipment  as our products are generally sold on terms that transfer title and risk of ownership when it leaves our site 
we sell service contracts for which revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period and service contracts based on a purchased quantity of hours under which revenue is recognized as service hours are delivered 
we recognize revenue from licensing and technology support agreements ratably over the contract period  or the estimated useful life of the licensed technologies  whichever is shorter 
costs related to deferred product revenues are capitalized deferred and recognized at the time of revenue recognition 
deferred product revenue and costs are netted on our balance sheet  under the caption deferred product and services income 
inventories and purchase order commitments the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements and market conditions 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect inventory at lower of cost or market 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  product mix or technological developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if we find that our estimates are too optimistic and we determine that our inventory needs to be written down  we will be required to recognize such costs in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
for example  if the demand assumption used in our assessment at december  was reduced by  assuming all other assumptions such as product mix are kept the same and that mitigation efforts were not possible  we would have had to write down our inventory and open purchase commitments by  conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down  our gross margin in that period will be favorably impacted 
during the three year period ended december   we recorded a write down of inventory of million in and subsequently realized favorable gross margin impacts of million and million  respectively  in and due to the sales of inventory previously written down 
warranty obligations we recognize the estimated cost of our product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage rates and the efficiency by which the product failure is corrected 
should actual product failure rates  material usage rates and labor efficiencies differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could result in future charges or credits to our gross margins 
during the three years ended december   our estimates and assumptions have not changed significantly and our estimates have approximated actual costs incurred 
allowance for bad debt we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this reserve is established based upon historical trends  current economic conditions  delinquency status based on contractual terms and an analysis of specific exposures 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or even a single customer was otherwise unable to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the average selling price of our systems is in excess of million 
accordingly  a single customer default could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
during the three years ended december   we did not experience significant write offs of accounts receivable 
as a result  we have reduced our bad debt reserve as a percentage of gross accounts receivable from at december  to at december  deferred income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
at december   the valuation allowance was million 
based on the uncertainty of future pre tax income for us tax purposes  we have presently fully reserved our domestic net deferred tax assets 
at december   we had recorded approximately million of foreign deferred tax assets related to our japanese operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the domestic deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation reserve would increase income through an increase in the company s income tax benefit in the period such determination was made 
results of operations we derive a substantial portion of our total net sales from sales of a relatively small number of newly manufactured systems  which typically range in price from million to million 
as a result of these high sale prices  the timing and recognition of revenue from a single transaction has had and most likely will continue to have a significant impact on our net sales and operating results for any particular period 
our backlog at the beginning of a period typically does not include all of the sales needed to achieve our sales objectives for that period 
in addition  orders in backlog are subject to cancellation  shipment or customer acceptance delays  and deferral or rescheduling by a customer with limited or no penalties 
consequently  our net sales and operating results for a period have been and will continue to be dependent upon our obtaining orders for systems to be shipped and accepted in the same period in which the order is received 
our business and financial results for a particular period could be materially adversely affected if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipment and customer acceptance during that period 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our shipments have historically occurred near the end of each quarter 
delays in installation and customer acceptance due  for example  to our inability to successfully demonstrate the agreed upon specifications or criteria at the customer s facility  or to the failure of the customer to permit installation of the system in the agreed upon time  may cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below our expectations  which may materially adversely affect our operating results for that period 
this risk is especially applicable in connection with the introduction and initial sales of a new product line 
additionally  the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments due  for example  to rescheduling  delays  deferrals or cancellations by customers  additional customer configuration requirements  or to unexpected manufacturing difficulties or delays in deliveries by suppliers due to their long production lead times or otherwise  have caused and may continue to cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below our expectations  materially adversely affecting our operating results for that period 
in particular  the long manufacturing and acceptance cycles of our saturn spectrum family of wafer steppers and laser thermal processing systems and the long lead time for lenses and other materials  could cause shipments and acceptances of such products to be delayed from one quarter to the next  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for a particular quarter 
additionally  the need for continued expenditures for research and development  capital equipment  ongoing training and worldwide customer service and support  among other factors  will make it difficult for us to reduce our operating expenses in a particular period if we fail to achieve our net sales goals for the period 
net sales vs 
in millions amount of change percentage change sales of systems spare parts services licenses total net sales net sales consist of revenues from system sales  spare parts sales  services and licensing of technologies 
system sales increased  to million  on a unit volume increase of 
the weighted average selling prices of systems sold declined from the prior year due to an increase in the percentage of refurbished systems sold as compared to the prior year 
in  refurbished systems accounted for approximately of units sold as compared to of units sold in this percentage can fluctuate from year to year and  as refurbished units generally have lower average selling prices than new units  any such fluctuation will impact the weighted average selling price of the systems sold 
on a product market application basis  system sales to the semiconductor industry  primarily for advanced packaging applications  were million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared with system sales of million in this increase was due to a increase in volume and a increase in the weighted average selling price resulting from a small decrease in the percentage of refurbished systems sold in as compared to system sales to the nanotechnology market were million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared with sales of million in this increase was due to a increase in volume  primarily as a result of increased sales to thin film head customers  partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average selling price 
the decrease in the weighted average selling price resulted from an increase in the percentage of refurbished systems sold in as compared to in  refurbished systems accounted for approximately of units sold as compared to of units sold in sales of spare parts for decreased  to million  as compared to this decrease was due to less revenue from system upgrades and a lower level of spare parts sales activity in asia 
revenues from services increased  to million  primarily as a result of an increase in system relocations and new service contracts for existing customers in north america and asia 
revenues from licensing and licensing support arrangements increased to million  as compared with million in  as a result of a payment we received from a company under a licensing agreement 
we do not expect a similar payment in the future 
except as noted above  we expect license revenue to continue at its current level until april at which time our deferred license revenue will be fully amortized 
at december   we had approximately million of deferred product and services income resulting from products shipped but not yet installed and accepted and deferred service revenue  essentially the same level as reported at december  during  deferred license revenue decreased by million  to million  as a result of amortization of proceeds received in prior periods 
amortization of deferred license income results in current period license revenue 
deferred income related to our products is recognized upon satisfying the contractual obligations for installation and or customer acceptance 
for the year ended december   international net sales were million  or of total net sales  as compared with million  or of total net sales for we expect sales to international customers to continue to represent a significant majority of our revenues during our revenue derived from sales in foreign countries is not generally subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations  principally because sales contracts for our systems are generally denominated in us dollars 
in japan  however  orders are often denominated in japanese yen 
for the year ended december   we recorded system sales in japan of million of which were denominated in japanese yen 
this subjects us to the risk of currency fluctuations 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the period between when an order is received and when it is recorded as revenue 
after recording revenue  we use various mechanisms  such as foreign currency forward exchange contracts and natural hedges  to offset substantial portions of the gains or losses associated with our japanese yen denominated receivables due to exchange rate fluctuations 
we had approximately million of japanese yen denominated receivables at december  international sales expose us to a number of additional risks  including fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar  which impact the relative cost of ownership of our products and  thus  the customer s willingness to purchase our product

vs 
in millions amount of change percentage change sales of systems spare parts services licenses total net sales system sales increased  to million  on a unit volume increase of 
excluding reduction lithography systems  which we have discontinued  system sales increased to million  on a unit volume increase of 
we discontinued the xls reduction stepper platform in september however  we were able to sell three systems that had been previously written down during the year ended december  the weighted average selling prices of systems sold  exclusive of reduction systems  increased due primarily to a lower proportion of lower priced refurbished systems sold in in  refurbished systems accounted for approximately of units sold as compared to of units sold in on a product market application basis  system sales to the semiconductor industry  primarily for advanced packaging applications  were million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared with system sales of million in system sales to the semiconductor industry included million and million of reduction stepper systems  which have been discontinued  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is due to increased purchases by the semiconductor industry as demand for products with advanced packaging capabilities has increased  particularly in the bump technology area  during system sales to the nanotechnology market were million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared with sales of million in  primarily as a result of growth in the laser diode and led markets and improvements in the disk drive industry 
sales of spare parts for increased  to million  as compared to this increase is due to increased levels of manufacturing within the semiconductor industry  resulting in greater utilization of the equipment  and an increase in upgrades of customer systems 
revenues from services declined  to million  primarily as a result of fewer units coming out of warranty during the year partially offset by increased revenue from training courses that we offered of million 
revenues from licensing and licensing support arrangements declined to million  as compared with million in  as a result of a large technology support agreement that expired in february at december   we had approximately million of deferred product and services income resulting from products shipped but not yet installed and accepted and deferred service revenue  as compared with million at december  the decrease in deferred product and services income resulted from lower shipments of systems not yet installed and accepted as compared to systems recognized for revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of during  deferred license income decreased by million  to million  as a result of amortization of proceeds received in prior periods 
for the year ended december   international net sales were million  or of total net sales  as compared with million  or of total net sales for gross profit vs 
on a comparative basis  gross margins were and for and  respectively 
the percentage point improvement in gross margin in was due primarily to efficiencies associated with increased production and services activity points and increased license revenue which has little  if any  cost of sales associated with it 
points offset partially by the favorable impact in from the sale of xls reduction lithography systems which had been previously written down percentage points and the favorable impact in due primarily to the sale of inventory previously written down percentage points 
exclusive of licensing revenues  gross margin was for as compared with for we believe disclosure of gross margins without reference to licensing revenues provides additional appropriate disclosure to allow comparison of our product and service gross margins over time because there is little  if any  cost of sales associated with our licensing revenues 
we expect license revenue to continue at the current level until april  when it will cease 
gross margins will be negatively impacted by the discontinuance of license revenue at that time 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales has been and most likely will continue to be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products sold  the introduction of new products  which typically have higher manufacturing costs until manufacturing efficiencies are realized and which are typically discounted more than existing products until the products gain market acceptance  the rate of capacity utilization  writedowns of inventory and open purchase commitments  technology support and licensing revenues  which have no associated cost of sales  product discounts  pricing and competition in our targeted markets  non linearity of shipments during the quarter which can result in manufacturing inefficiencies  the percentage of international sales  which typically have lower gross margins than domestic sales principally due to higher field service and support costs  and start up costs and inefficiencies associated with the implementation of subcontracting arrangements 
vs 
on a comparative basis  gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the improvement in gross margin in was due primarily to inventory write downs in plus the favorable impact of selling inventory in previously written down points  improved service and warranty costs resulting from improved product quality and better utilization of our personnel points  increased production levels resulting in better utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure points  and lower manufacturing costs of which million was due to the recording of an expense in related to prior periods due to rent averaging requirements under certain of our facility leases points 
these improvements were offset partially by the impact of lower licensing revenue points  which has no associated cost of sales  and a change in product mix 
exclusive of licensing and licensing support revenues  gross margin was for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  we believe disclosure of gross margins without reference to licensing revenues provides additional appropriate disclosure to allow comparison of our product and service gross margins over time because there is little  if any  cost of sales associated with our licensing revenues 
research  development and engineering expenses vs 
amount of percentage in millions change change research  development and engineering expenses the increase in research  development and engineering expenses in as compared to was due to increased investments in the development of our laser processing technologies and our next generation x stepper products 
we continue to invest significant resources in the development and enhancement of our laser processing systems and technologies and our x products and related technologies 
given that there is an inherent delay between the time product development activities and expenditures occur and when resultant product revenue is ultimately realized  current year research  development and engineering investments contributed very little to the current year s revenue 
however  we expect that product development efforts during will contribute to revenue in future years 
approximately of our system revenue in represented products or features developed by us during the three years ended december  vs 
in millions amount of change percentage change research  development and engineering expenses the million year over year decline in research  development and engineering spending was primarily attributable to the restructuring of the applications engineering function in september million  the discontinuance of our advanced reduction stepper platforms in the second half of million and the impact of recording a million non cash expense in related to prior periods  pursuant to rent averaging requirements under certain of our facility leases 
these favorable impacts were offset partially by increased spending on our laser processing technologies and our next generation x stepper products 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million for the years ended december   and we expect this expense to be million in the first quarter of and to end in march selling  general and administrative expenses vs 
in millions amount of change percentage change selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense increased by million in as compared to this increase was due to increased marketing and sales activity primarily driven by our efforts in laser processing million  increased legal costs primarily related to our being a plaintiff in a patent infringement lawsuit million  increased costs associated with our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec and nasdaq rules million  increased sales commission expense due to increased revenues million  and other individually insignificant items which in total increased million 
vs 
in millions amount of change percentage change selling  general and administrative expenses the year over year decline in selling  general and administrative expense was million 
this decrease was primarily attributable to cost containment measures implemented in the second half of million and reduced legal costs million  partially offset by higher selling expenses associated with a increase in our revenue million and increased corporate governance costs primarily associated with our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec and nasdaq rules million 
restructure of operations in september  in response to suddenly worsening conditions in the semiconductor industry in particular  and the general economy as a whole  we decided to reduce our workforce by approximately and to cease or suspend activities related to certain engineering and administrative initiatives 
as a result of this decision  we recognized a restructuring charge of million for the three month period ended september  we reduced this charge by million during the three month period ended december   primarily as a result of canceling our plans to exit a certain building and an adjustment of our international severance costs 
of the total net charge for the year ended december  of million  the cash component included employee severance costs of million  contract termination fees of million and facility closure costs of million 
the non cash component of this charge included million of impairment to the carrying value of equipment and leasehold improvements and million of impairment to prepaid expenses and other current assets 
we further reduced this charge by million during the three month period ending june   as a result of a gain recorded from the sale of certain fixed assets previously written down 
as of december   all restructuring costs had been paid 
in september  we reached a decision to consolidate our manufacturing operations and eliminate approximately of our workforce 
as a result of this decision  we recognized a restructuring charge of million in the quarter ended september  additionally  we recognized restructuring charges of million  or per share diluted in the quarter ended december   primarily related to employee severance costs of million from additional personnel actions and higher fixed asset disposal costs of million  partially offset by revised facility closure and other cost estimates of million 
of the full year charge of million  non cash components included a million impairment charge for intangible assets related to our xls reduction product platform acquired in and a million impairment charge for fixed assets disposed of in conjunction with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities 
the cash components of this charge included million for estimated expenditures related to the closure of facilities  million for employee severance costs and million of other restructuring costs 
in october  we reached an agreement to terminate our lease for a facility in wilmington  massachusetts 
as a result of this agreement we recorded a recovery of restructuring charges of million during the period ending december  as of december   all restructuring costs had been paid 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income  net years ended december  in thousands interest income other income expense  net interest and other income  net interest income was million for the year ended december   as compared with million for and million for included in the amounts reported for and were and million  respectively  relating to interest on tax settlements or refunds 
the decreases in and from the prior year  excluding the interest income on tax settlements or refunds  were primarily due to lower interest rates on our investments 
we presently maintain an investment portfolio with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
consequently  changes in short term interest rates have a significant impact on our interest income 
future changes are expected to have a similar impact 
income tax expense benefit for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax expense of million which included a million benefit related to the settlement of tax audit issues in the united kingdom 
the actual expense recorded  excluding the benefit related to the settlement of tax audit issues in the united kingdom  represents of pre tax income 
this rate is higher than the united states us federal rate of because the tax benefit of us losses was not recognized as domestic deferred tax assets are fully reserved 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million  inclusive of a special tax benefit of million related to the settlement of a research and development tax credit claim with the california franchise tax board and million related to the resolution of certain tax audit issues in the united kingdom 
additionally  we recorded a million benefit from the reversal of reserves associated with deferred tax assets carried on the balance sheet of our japan subsidiary  reflecting improved operating trends in that region 
offsetting these tax benefits was a tax expense of approximately million related  primarily  to taxable income in our foreign entities  for which there is no corresponding net operating loss carry forward benefit 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
the benefit relates to resolution of our irs audit for the years through and a carry back of losses to recover prior years federal alternative minimum taxes of million 
in october  the united states enacted the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act provides for a three year phase out of current extraterritorial income tax eti benefits and replaces eti with a phased in nine percent domestic production activity deduction that will not be fully effective until we do not currently realize eti tax benefits 
this provision of the act is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations of financial position in the near future 
the act also includes a deduction of for certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the act 
we do not intend to repatriate any of our foreign earnings during the effective period of this deduction under the act 
we presently anticipate that we will recognize income tax expense in of approximately of pre tax income  primarily as a result of foreign income taxes and federal alternative minimum tax 
we believe that the tax rate in will be substantially less than the rate in and the statutory rate because of available federal net operating loss carry forwards 
we expect to recognize the benefit of the use of these carry forwards by reversing the valuation allowance associated with these domestic deferred tax assets 
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether  and within which jurisdictions  future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states  combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters  and we do not anticipate any material earnings impact from their ultimate resolutions 
outlook although we believe that our served markets have generally strengthened during the last twelve months  the anticipated timing of orders  shipments and customer acceptances usually requires us to fill a number of production slots in any given quarter in order to meet our sales targets 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to secure those production orders  or if existing production orders are delayed or cancelled  our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted 
accordingly  we may not be able to achieve or maintain our current or prior level of sales 
we presently expect that net sales for will increase to from the level of net sales reported in of million 
because our net sales are subject to a number of risks  including risks associated with the introduction of our new laser processing product line including delays in customer acceptance  intense competition in the capital equipment industry  uncertainty relating to the timing and market acceptance of our products and the condition of the macro economy and the semiconductor industry  we may not exceed or maintain our current or prior level of net sales for any period in the future 
additionally  we believe that the market acceptance and volume production of our saturn spectrum e  our mm offerings  our laser processing systems  our new generation of x steppers and our series family of wafer steppers  are of critical importance to our future financial results 
at december   these critical systems represented of our backlog 
to the extent that these products do not achieve or maintain significant sales due to difficulties involving manufacturing or engineering  the inability to reduce the current long manufacturing cycles for these products  competition  excess capacity in the semiconductor or nanotechnology device industries  customer acceptances  or any other reason  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
we believe that gross margin for will be between and  as compared to gross margin of for should our sales not reach the level expected  we may incur a higher risk of inventory obsolescence and excess purchase commitments and lower utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure  which would materially adversely impact our results of operations 
new products generally have lower gross margins until there is widespread market acceptance and until production and after sales efficiencies can be achieved 
should significant market demand fail to develop for our laser processing systems  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  higher costs associated with extended customer acceptance periods on early shipments of our new laser processing products will negatively affect our gross margins 
we continue to invest significant resources in the development and enhancement of our laser processing systems and technologies and our x products and related technologies 
further  we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to be impacted by the factors noted above in the explanation of current period variances 
as a result  we believe operating margin for will be between and and net income per share will be between and 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared with net cash generated by operations of million for the comparable period in net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was attributable to the net change in operating assets and liabilities of million offset partially by non cash charges to income of million and net income of million 
the million use of cash from the net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of an increase in accounts receivable of million  reflecting a increase in shipments during the fourth quarter of as compared to shipments during the fourth quarter of  an increase in inventories of million  due to the roll out of our laser processing product  a decrease in deferred license revenue of million  an increase in long term demonstration inventories of million and a use of cash of million due to changes in all other assets and liabilities 
these uses were offset partially by an increase in accounts payable of million due to investments in our facilities and inventory related to our laser processing product during the fourth quarter of we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of certain of our systems  particularly newer products  our inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
currently  we are devoting significant resources to the development  introduction and commercialization of our laser processing system and to the development of our next generation x lithography technologies 
we currently intend to continue to incur significant operating expenses in the areas of research  development and engineering  manufacturing and selling  general and administrative costs in order to further develop  produce and support these new products 
additionally  gross profit margins  inventory and capital equipment levels may be adversely impacted in the future by costs associated with the initial production of the laser processing system and by future generations of our x wafer steppers 
these costs include  but are not limited to  additional manufacturing overhead  costs of demonstration systems and facilities and the establishment of additional after sales support organizations 
additionally  there can be no assurance that operating expenses will not increase  relative to sales  as a result of adding technical  marketing and administrative personnel  among other costs  to support our new products 
if we are unable to achieve significantly increased net sales or if our sales fall below expectations  our cash flow and operating results will be materially adversely affected until  among other factors  costs and expenses can be reduced 
our failure to achieve our sales targets for these new products could result in additional inventory write offs and asset impairment charges  either of which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities was million due to a net decrease in available for sale securities of million partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
we are planning to incur capital expenditures in of approximately million for equipment and facility improvements driven primarily by our new product introductions 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december   attributable to increased borrowings of million and million in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
at december   we had working capital of million 
our principal source of liquidity at december  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net of our borrowings under our line of credit 
we have approximately million of retained earnings in our foreign subsidiaries 
although it is not our intent to repatriate these earnings  possible adverse tax consequences associated with repatriating these funds may effectively restrict their use to cash requirements in those specific jurisdictions 
during  we received proceeds of million in conjunction with a sale leaseback transaction 
to provide additional security to the lessor  we granted a security interest in certain of our other equipment 
we recorded a deferred rent credit equal to the excess of the sale proceeds over the adjusted basis in the equipment sold 
in september  we paid million to close this transaction and to purchase the related capital asset 
the impact from this transaction on our results of operations for the year ended december  was immaterial 
in december  we entered into a line of credit agreement with a brokerage firm replacing a similar arrangement that we had with a different firm 
under the terms of this agreement  we may borrow funds at a cost equal to the current federal funds rate plus basis points as of december  
certain of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments secure borrowings outstanding under this facility 
funds are advanced to us under this facility based on pre determined advance rates on the cash and securities held by us in this brokerage account 
this agreement has no set expiration date and there are no loan covenants 
as of december   million was outstanding under this facility  with a related collateral requirement of approximately million of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december   million was outstanding under a similar facility  with a related collateral requirement of approximately million of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in january  our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock at prevailing market prices 
this authorization expired on december  we did not elect to repurchase any shares under this arrangement 
should we decide to acquire our own shares in the open market  potentially large amounts of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments would be required 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions total less than year years years after years notes payable obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations equipment non cancelable operating lease obligations buildings long term payables open purchase order commitments total contractual cash obligations the amounts shown in the table above for open purchase order commitments are primarily related to the purchase of inventories  equipment and leasehold improvements 
we record charges to operations for purchase order commitments we deem in excess of normal operating requirements see critical accounting policies and estimates 
the development and manufacture of new lithography systems and enhancements are highly capital intensive 
in order to be competitive  we believe we must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment  sales  service  training and support capabilities  systems  procedures and controls  and expansion of operations and research and development  among many other items 
we expect that cash generated from operations and our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  in the near term  we may continue to utilize existing and future lines of credit  and other sources of financing  in order to maintain our present levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
beyond the next twelve months  we may require additional equity or debt financing to address our working capital or capital equipment needs 
in addition  we may seek to raise equity or debt capital at any time that we deem market conditions to be favorable 
additional financing  if needed  may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
we may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses 
future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  personnel and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in the event we acquire product lines  technologies or businesses which do not complement our business  or which otherwise do not enhance our sales or operating results  we may incur substantial write offs and higher recurring operating costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that any such acquisition does occur  there can be no assurance as to the effect thereof on our business or operating results 
off balance sheet transactions our off balance sheet transactions consist of certain financial guarantees  both expressed and implied  related to indemnification for product liability  patent infringement and latent product defects 
other than liabilities recorded pursuant to known product defects  at december   we did not record a liability associated with these guarantees  as we have little or no history of costs associated with such indemnification requirements 
foreign currency as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we attempt to hedge most of our japanese yen denominated foreign currency exposures 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risk that unremitted japanese yen denominated receipts from customers for actual or forecasted sales of equipment after receipt of customer orders may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
after recording revenue  we use various mechanisms  such as foreign currency forward exchange contracts and natural hedges  to offset substantial portions of the potential gains or losses associated with our japanese yen denominated assets and liabilities due to exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   we had taken action to hedge approximately of these japanese yen denominated exposures 
in addition to natural hedges resulting from having both assets and liabilities denominated in japanese yen  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of nine months or less 
we often close foreign currency forward contracts by entering into an offsetting contract 
at december   we had contracts for the sale of million of foreign currencies at fixed rates of exchange

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk due to potential changes in interest rates  relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted primarily of fixed interest rate instruments as of december  we maintain an investment policy designed to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting market risk and the risk of default 
certain of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments serve as collateral for a line of credit we maintain with a brokerage firm 
the line of credit is used for liquidity purposes  mitigating the need to liquidate investments in order to meet our current operating cash requirements 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
these instruments are comprised of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
these instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling techniques used measure the change in fair values arising from selected hypothetical changes in interest rates 
assumed market value changes to our portfolio reflects immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points no change in interest rate valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points short term investments  in thousands bps bps bps bps bps bps bps us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions us corporate debt securities total short term investments we have not materially altered our investment objectives or criteria and believe that  although the composition of our portfolio has changed from the preceding year  the portfolio s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is materially the same 
credit risk we mitigate credit default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and is diversified in accordance with our investment policy 
to date  we have not experienced significant liquidity problems with our portfolio 
our largest holding at december   excluding the united states government and its agencies  was million 
foreign exchange risk the majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we have established transaction and balance sheet hedging programs 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risk that unremitted japanese yen denominated receipts from customers for actual or forecasted sales of equipment after receipt of customer orders may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
after recording revenue  we use various mechanisms  such as foreign currency forward exchange contracts and natural hedges  to offset substantial portions of the potential gains or losses associated with our japanese yen denominated assets and liabilities due to exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   we had taken action to hedge approximately of these japanese yen denominated exposures 
in addition to natural hedges resulting from having both assets and liabilities denominated in japanese yen  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of nine months or less 
we often close foreign currency forward contracts by entering into an offsetting contract 
at december   we had contracts for the sale of million of japanese yen at fixed rates of exchange 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency movements
