acquisitions and disposals in november   we acquired virgin media group s remaining ownership interests in virgin net limited together with the remaining interests held by existing and former management 
the acquisition increased our ownership in virgin net limited from to 
virgin net limited provides internet services through the virgin 
net isp 
as of december   we had approximately  residential customers using the virgin 
net isp 
on december   we reached an agreement to sell our broadcast operations to a consortium led by macquarie communications infrastructure group 
the sale closed on january  the cash proceeds from the sale were approximately billion  subject to a post closing working capital adjustment 
our broadcast operations provided site leasing  broadcast transmission  satellite  media  public safety communications and other network services  utilizing broadcast transmission infrastructure  wireless communications and other facilities 
changes in financial reporting we implemented modifications to the financial reporting of our business during the fourth quarter of to reflect changes in the way we manage our business 
previously  we managed and accounted for our operations in five operating segments 
additionally  various shared services  including finance  legal  information technology  network services and human resources  were reported in a separate line item 
during the course of we effected a series of internal reorganizations of our operations and we entered into an agreement to sell our broadcast operations 
as a result  our business is now operated as a single segment and we will report our results as a single segment under the relevant accounting guidelines 
financial information for all prior periods presented in this report has been restated accordingly 
discontinued operations as a result of the sale of our broadcast operations  we are accounting for the broadcast operations as a discontinued operation 
financial information for all prior periods presented in this report is restated accordingly 
accordingly  the results of operations for the broadcast operations have been excluded from the components of loss from continuing operations and shown in a separate caption  titled income from discontinued operations  and the assets and liabilities of the broadcast operations are reported as held for sale for all periods in this report 
revenue from the broadcast operations reported in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million respectively 
pre tax income from broadcast operations  reported as pre tax income from discontinued operations  for the years ended december   and  was million  million  and million respectively 
factors affecting our business our residential customers account for the majority of our total revenue 
the number of customers  the number and types of services that each customer uses and the prices we charge for these services drive our revenue 
our profit is driven by the relative margins on the types of services we provide to customers 
for example  broadband internet is more profitable than atv 
our packaging of services and our pricing are designed to encourage our customers to use multiple services like dual telephone and broadband 
factors affecting our profitability include customer churn  average revenue per user  or arpu  and competition 
summary statistics selected statistics for uk residential customers for the three months ended december  as well as the four prior quarters are set forth in the table below 
three months ended december  september  june  march  december  opening customers     data cleanse     adjusted opening customers     customer additions      customer disconnections     net customer movement      reduction in customer count    closing customers     churn revenue generating units  television      dtv      telephone      broadband      total revenue generating units    rgu customers internet dial up and dtv access     average revenue per user customer numbers have been updated to include customers off our network and virgin 
net customers 
data cleanse activity  as part of the harmonization of billing systems  resulted in a decrease in the number of recorded customers by approximately  in the three months ended december  we anticipate that there may be similar adjustments to customer and rgu numbers as data cleanse progresses during the course of the year 
we have removed approximately  customers  representing approximately  rgus from the customer count in the three months ended december   and approximately  customers  representing  rgus from the customer count  in the three months ended september   following implementation of a new credit policy and the resulting disconnection of inactive backlog customers 
of the  rgus removed in the three months ended december    are telephone rgus   are dtv rgus   are atv rgus   are broadband rgus and  are rgus of customers off our network 
in the three months ended june   we disconnected a backlog of  non paying telephone customers that were off our network 
customer churn is calculated by taking the total disconnects during the month and dividing them by the average number of customers during the month 
average monthly churn during a quarter is the average of the three monthly churn calculations within the quarter 
each telephone  television and broadband internet subscriber directly connected to our network counts as one rgu 
accordingly  a subscriber who receives both telephone and television service counts as two rgus 
rgus may include subscribers receiving some services for free or at a reduced rate in connection with incentive offers 
dial up internet customers have been adjusted to exclude metered customers who have not used the service within the last days and have been updated to include the isp  virgin 
net 
average revenue per user  or arpu  is calculated on a monthly basis by dividing total revenue generated from the provision of telephone  cable television and internet services to customers who are directly connected to our network in that month  exclusive of vat  by the average number of customers in that month 
quarterly arpu is the average of the three months in that quarter 
customer churn 
customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop using our services 
an increase in our customer churn can lead to increased costs and reduced revenue 
we continue to focus on improving our customer service and enhancing and expanding our service offerings to existing customers in an effort to manage our customer churn rate 
although our ability to reduce our customer churn rate beyond a base level is limited by factors like customers moving outside our network service area  in particular during the summer season  managing our customer churn rate is a significant component of our business plan 
to help meet these objectives  we are in the process of integrating various billing systems and customer databases 
no assurances can be made to the timing of our further integration efforts or the degree of integration ultimately accomplished 
in addition  our customer churn rate may also increase if we are unable to deliver our services over our network without interruption or if we fail to match offerings by our competitors 
arpu 
average revenue per user  or arpu  is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing potential revenue from customers 
we believe that our triple play offering of telephone service  broadband access to the internet and dtv will prove attractive to our existing customer base and allow us to increase our arpu by facilitating the sale of multiple services to each customer 
competition 
our ability to acquire and retain customers and increase revenue depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant competition in our markets  including through other broadband service providers  telephone services offered by bt  alternative internet access services like dsl  which is offered by bt  digital satellite television services offered by bskyb and digital terrestrial television offered by freeview 
if competitive forces prevent us from charging the prices for these services that we plan to charge  or if our competition is able to attract our customers or potential customers we are targeting  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
capital expenditures 
our business requires substantial capital expenditures on a continuing basis for various purposes  including expanding  maintaining and upgrading our network  investing in new customer acquisitions  and offering new services 
if we do not continue to invest in our network  our ability to retain and acquire customers may be hindered 
therefore  our liquidity and the availability of cash to fund capital projects are important drivers of our revenue 
when our liquidity is restricted  so is our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with cash from operations  and if required  drawdowns under the million revolving tranche of our senior credit facility  will be sufficient for our cash requirements in currency movements 
we encounter currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenue and operating costs are earned and paid primarily in pounds and  to a lesser extent  euros  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our existing indebtedness in us dollars 
to the extent that the pound declines in value against the us dollar  the effective cost of servicing our us dollar debt will be higher 
as of december   million  or of our long term debt  was denominated in us dollars 
to mitigate the risk from these exposures  we have implemented a cash flow hedging program 
the objective of this program is to reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying rates 
because revenue and expenses from our principal operations are denominated primarily in pounds but we report our financial results in us dollars  our financial results are also impacted by currency fluctuations  which are unrelated to our underlying results of operations 
seasonality 
some revenue streams are subject to seasonal factors 
for example  telephone usage revenue by customers and businesses tends to be slightly lower during summer holiday months 
our customer churn rates include persons who disconnect service because of moves  resulting in a seasonal increase in our churn rates during the summer months when higher levels of uk house moves occur and students leave their accommodations between school years 
integration of billing systems 
our historical growth through acquisitions resulted in us inheriting numerous billing systems  which had many differences in functionality  resulting in inefficiencies in our customer service processes 
we have consolidated the number of billing systems for our residential customers from eleven at the beginning of to three at the end of we have also migrated approximately million accounts to a new billing platform 
we continue to evaluate how many billing systems we will utilize for residential and business customers  taking into account the prospects for improved efficiencies and better customer service as well as the potential for disruption in the business from additional migration of data 
during  we re phased the program schedule so that it would be substantially completed in the second quarter of we are currently reevaluating the timing of the program s completion  and accordingly no assurance can be made as to the timing of further integration efforts 
the total cost of the integration program is estimated to be approximately million  or million  of which we have incurred approximately million  or million  through december  call center consolidation 
on april   we announced the consolidation over the next months of our uk customer service call centers into three equipped to handle anticipated expansion of our customer base 
following an internal review  three specialist call centers will be retained and developed and will be supported by four sales and customer support sites  located throughout the uk as part of the consolidation  we intend to make additional investments in technology and training in order to streamline processes and generate efficiencies 
as of december   we have incurred million  or million of costs  and we expect to incur a total approximately million  or million  of costs to execute this program including property costs that will be expensed as the properties are vacated 
if the integration of our billing systems or the consolidation of our call centers are not successful  we could experience an adverse effect on our customer service  customer churn rate and costs of maintaining these systems going forward 
we could also experience operational failures related to billing and collecting revenue from our customers which  depending on the severity of the failure  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported  as well as disclosures about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the following critical accounting policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements 
an impact could occur because of the significance of the financial statement item to which these policies relate  or because these policies require more judgment and estimation than other matters owing to the uncertainty related to measuring  at a specific point in time  transactions that are continuous in nature 
foreign currency translation our functional currencies are the pound sterling and the euro  while our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the assets and liabilities of our uk and ireland subsidiaries have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates  and revenue and expenses have been translated at the average rates for the respective years 
exchange gains and losses on our net equity investment in our subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in the statement of operations 
fixed assets fixed assets  net  totaled  million and  million  representing and of total assets at december  and december   respectively 
in accordance with sop  upon our emergence from chapter reorganization  we adopted fresh start reporting as of january  pursuant to fresh start reporting  the carrying values of our fixed assets were adjusted to their reorganization values  which were equivalent to their estimated fair values 
these adjusted carrying values became the revised cost basis of our fixed assets at january  fixed assets  net were written down by  million to reflect this adjustment 
fixed assets acquired since january   are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the cost of fixed assets includes amounts capitalized for labor and overhead expended in connection with the design and installation of our operating network equipment and facilities 
costs associated with initial customer installations  additions of network equipment necessary to enable advanced services  acquisition of additional fixed assets and replacement of existing fixed assets are capitalized 
the costs of reconnecting the same service to a previously installed premise are charged to expense in the period incurred 
costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we assign fixed assets and intangible assets useful lives that impact the annual depreciation and amortization expense 
the assignment of useful lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
our managers use their experience and expertise in applying judgments about appropriate estimates 
changes in technology or changes in intended use of these assets may cause the estimated useful life to change  resulting in higher or lower depreciation charges or asset impairment charges 
labor and overhead costs directly related to the construction and installation of fixed assets  including payroll and related costs of some employees and related rent and other occupancy costs  are capitalized 
the payroll and related costs of some employees that are directly related to construction and installation activities are capitalized based on specific time devoted to these activities where identifiable 
in cases where the time devoted to these activities is not specifically identifiable  we capitalized costs based upon estimated allocations 
we are continuing to enhance our processes to reduce reliance upon these estimates in determining amounts capitalized 
the labor and overhead costs capitalized in the years ended december   and were approximately million  or million  approximately million  or million  and approximately million  or million 
the following table illustrates the calculation of labor and overhead costs capitalized as a percentage of total operating and selling  general and administrative expenses and as a percentage of cash used to purchase fixed assets 
year ended december  reorganized company reorganized company predecessor company in millions labor and overhead costs capitalized total operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses labor and overhead costs capitalized as a percentage of total operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses purchase of fixed assets labor and overhead costs capitalized as a percentage of purchase of fixed assets impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying values of our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  by first grouping our long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group and  secondly  estimating the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise from the use of and eventual disposition of such asset group 
we estimate the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group 
if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
we determine fair value through quoted market prices in active markets or  if quoted market prices are unavailable  through the performance of internal analysis of discounted cash flows or external appraisals 
the undiscounted and discounted cash flow analyses are based on a number of estimates and assumptions  including the expected period over which the asset will be utilized  projected future operating results of the asset group  discount rate and long term growth rate 
our assessments of impairment of long lived assets and our periodic review of the remaining useful lives of our long lived assets are an integral part of our ongoing strategic review of the business and operations 
future changes in our strategy and other changes in our operations could impact the projected future operating results that are inherent in our estimates of fair value  resulting in impairments in the future 
additionally  other changes in the estimates and assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term growth rate  which drive the valuation techniques employed to estimate the fair value of long lived assets could change and  therefore  impact the assessments of impairment in the future 
revenue we recognize revenue only when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists between us and our customers  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the price for the service is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle  and is recognized as the services are provided 
at the end of each period  adjustments are recorded to defer revenue relating to services billed in advance and to accrue for earned but unbilled services 
telephone  cable television and internet revenues are recognized as the services are provided to customers 
bundled services revenue is recognized at the time the services are provided to the customer or the performance of all of the services have been completed 
the company applies the provisions of eitf no  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to assess whether the components of the bundled services should be recognized separately 
installation revenue is recognized by applying the provisions of fasb statement no 
 financial reporting by cable television companies in relation to connection and activation fees for cable television  as well as telephone and internet services  on the basis that we market and maintain a unified fiber network through which we provide all of these services 
installation revenue is recognized at the time the installation has been completed to the extent that such revenue is less than direct selling costs 
installation revenue in excess of direct selling costs are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the customer s connection 
rental revenue in respect of line rentals and rental of equipment provided to customers is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the rental agreement 
pensions we account for our defined benefit pension plans using fasb statement no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  or fas  and the disclosure rules under the revised fasb statement no 
revised employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment of fasb statements  and under fas  pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
pension expense calculated under fas is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plan of million and million in and respectively 
we expect our pension expense to be approximately million in the fair value of our plan assets increased from million at december  to million at december  we contributed million in cash to our defined benefit pension plans in the calculation of pension expense and our pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
we believe that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
when calculating pension expense for  we assumed that our plans assets would generate a long term rate of return of between and 
this range is higher than the rates of between and used to calculate the expense 
we develop our expected long term rate of return assumption based on historical experience and by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plan s assets  including the trustee s review of asset class return expectations by several consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets  which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels 
the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio 
we discounted our future pension obligations using rates of between and at december   and rates of between and at december  we determine the appropriate discount rate based on the current rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced 
lowering the discount rate by would increase our pension liability at december  by approximately million and increase our estimated pension expense by approximately million 
at december   we have unrecognized actuarial losses of million 
these losses will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years 
our estimated pension expense of million includes the recognition of approximately million of these losses 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
at december   all of our pension plans have projected benefit obligations exceeding plan assets totaling million 
we will need to fund these deficits in accordance with the laws and regulations of the uk and the republic of ireland 
we expect to contribute a total of million  or million  in  of which million  or million  represents a single contribution agreed with the trustees of our pension plans to reduce the deficit in two of our pension plans  including million  or million  to be paid to our largest defined benefit pension plan 
software development costs we capitalize costs related to computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
software obtained for internal use has generally been enterprise level business and finance software that we customize to meet our specific operational needs 
costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives  generally three to five years 
we have not sold  leased or licensed software developed for internal use to our customers and we have no intention of doing so in the future 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or fas  we recognize derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting 
to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated and considered to be effective as a cash flow hedge of an exposure to future changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates  the change in fair value of the instrument is deferred in other comprehensive income 
amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement to match the corresponding cash flows on the underlying hedged transaction 
changes in fair value of any instrument not designated as a hedge or considered to be ineffective as a hedge are reported in earnings immediately 
restructuring costs as of january   we adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or fas  and recognize a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities when the liability is incurred 
the adoption of fas did not have a significant effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
prior to  we recognized a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities at the time a commitment to restructure was given  in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
in relation to our restructuring activities  we have recorded a liability of million as of december  relating to lease exit costs of properties that we have vacated 
in calculating the liability  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including the timing of ultimate disposal of the properties  our ability to sublet the properties either in part or as a whole  amounts of sublet rental income achievable including any incentives required to be given to sublessees  and amounts of lease termination costs 
stock based compensation we have a number of stock based employee compensation plans 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or fas under the prospective method of adoption that we selected under provision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  or fas  the recognition provisions will be applied to all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after january  prior to  our employees participated in the various stock option plans of our former ultimate parent company 
we accounted for the stock based compensation plans of our former ultimate parent company under accounting principles board opinion no 
 account for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation costs was reflected in  as all options granted under these plans had an intrinsic value of zero on the date of the grant 
all options to purchase shares of our former ultimate parent company s common stock were cancelled on the effective date of the plan 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized 
we recognize deferred tax assets only if it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be available in the future against which the temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilized 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing whether deferred tax assets should be recognized 
other policies we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and other receivables to reflect estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make payments 
these allowances are estimated based on the current aging of receivables  prior collection experience and future expectations of conditions that might impact recoverability 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additions to the allowances may be required 
our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on a view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency 
we consult legal counsel on matters related to litigation 
we consult both internal and external experts with respect to other matters that arise in the ordinary course of business 
examples of these matters that are based on assumptions  judgments and estimates include amounts to be paid to terminate some agreements included in restructuring charges and the amounts to be paid to settle some other liabilities 
a liability is accrued if the likelihood of occurrence of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is capable of estimation 
we incur interconnection and related costs from other carriers relating to the provision of telephone services 
these carriers can make retrospective adjustments to charges for these services which requires us to estimate certain charges for a particular period 
actual charges may differ from those estimated 
these policies may need to be revised in the future in the event that changes to our business occur 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no 
 revised in  share based payment  or fas r  which is a revision of fas fas r also supersedes apb and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
we previously adopted fas as of january  fas r differs from fas  by requiring all entities to measure liabilities incurred in stock based payment transactions at fair value rather than measuring the liability at its intrinsic value 
fas r requires entities to estimate the number of instruments for which the requisite service period is expected to be rendered rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
under fas r  modifications to the terms or conditions of an award are measured by comparing the fair value of the modified awarded with the fair value of the award immediately before the modification  as apposed to measuring the effects of a modification as the difference between the fair value of the modified awarded at the date it is granted and the awards value immediately before the modification 
fas r will also clarify and expand current guidance under fas including the measurement of fair value  classifying an award as either equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods 
fas r amends fas requiring that the excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
the statement is effective in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  fas r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation costs is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date and a modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate prior periods to reflect compensation cost calculated under fas for pro forma amounts disclosure 
we plan to adopt fas r using the modified prospective method 
as we currently account for share based payments to employees in accordance with the fair value method under fas  the adoption of fas r is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of also in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of we do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows  since we do not have any substantive operations in the us consolidated results of operations from continuing operations years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   consolidated revenue increased by to  million from  million for  and revenue expressed in pounds sterling increased by to  million from  million during the same period

this increase is due to an increase in rgus in  particularly as a result of customers taking our broadband internet services  as well as price increases in business for the year ended december   revenue from business customers increased by to million from million for  but revenue from business customers expressed in pounds sterling decreased by to million from million during the same period 
this decrease is because of fewer customers  major installations and orders as we continued our strategy of focusing on a smaller but more profitable customer base 
in addition  we have experienced lower telephone usage revenue per customer because of increased competition in the business telecommunications market  together with a move towards the use of mobile telephones rather than fixed lines 
this decrease has been partly mitigated by higher revenue from wholesale call termination and higher revenue from wholesale internet access solutions provided to isps 
ireland for the year ended december   revenue from ireland customers increased by to million from million for  and revenue from ireland customers expressed in pounds sterling increased slightly to million from million during the same period  and revenue from ireland customers expressed in euros increased by to million from million during the same period 
this increase is because of price rises and more dtv customers offset by the impact of fewer basic customers following the disconnection of a large number of non paying customers during expenses operating costs

foreign currency transaction losses gains our functional currencies are the pound sterling and  to a significantly lesser extent  the euro  while our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the assets and liabilities of our us and ireland subsidiaries have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates  and revenue and expenses have been translated at the average rates for the respective years 
exchange gains and losses on our net equity investment in our subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in the statement of operations 
for the year ended december   foreign currency transaction losses were million as compared with gains of million for these losses for the year ended december  were primarily because of the effect of changes in the exchange rate on the us dollar and euro denominated debt and unrealized losses of million arising from changes in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts 
our results of operations will continue to be affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations since million of our indebtedness is denominated in us dollars and million is denominated in euros

loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   loss from continuing operations was million as compared with a loss of million for the same period in the reduction in loss from continuing operations is attributable to our improved operating performance and savings in interest expense partly offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt 
loss from continuing operations per share basic and diluted loss from continuing operations per common share for the year ended december  was and for the year ended december  was 
basic and diluted loss from continuing operations per share is computed using an average of million shares issued in the year ended december  and an average of million shares issued for the same period in options to purchase million shares and million shares of restricted stock at december  are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss from continuing operations per share  since the inclusion of such options and shares is anti dilutive 
years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   consolidated revenue increased by to  million from  million in revenue expressed in pounds sterling increased by to  million from  million during the same period 
our revenue expressed in us dollars and pounds sterling by customer type for the years ended december  and are as follows in millions us dollars pound sterling increase decrease increase revenues consumer     business ireland total revenues     consumer for the year ended december   revenue from residential customers increased by to  million from  million for  and revenue from residential customers expressed in pounds sterling increased by to  million from  million during the same period 
this increase resulted from more customers subscribing to our broadband internet services  an increase in our customer base  and the impact of price increases for our broadband internet services and our cable television services 
these increases were partly offset by a reduction in our revenue from residential customers who are not on our cable network 
in the year ended december   we provided billing and other related services to the purchaser of the consumerco off net indirect access business which we sold in november  these services ceased during the fourth quarter of business for the year ended december   revenue from business customers increased by to million from million for  but revenue from business customers expressed in pounds sterling decreased by to million from million during the same period 
this decrease was primarily because of fewer customers  major installations and orders as we executed our strategy of focusing on a smaller but more profitable customer base 
the decline was also affected by the excess capacity in the carriers market that adversely affected pricing during and hampered our ability to obtain new business 
in addition  during the year ended december   we were able to recognize some revenue  which had previously been deferred  as a result of the insolvency of certain customers which released us from our obligations under our contracts with them 
these revenue were not repeated for the year ended december  the decline in revenue was partially offset by our selling of additional services to our existing customers and by increased revenue from mobile telecommunications operators 
we also increased our revenue from our wholesale internet access services through arrangements with other uk isps 
however  this was partly offset by a reduction to revenue previously billed by us to our wholesale internet customers in respect of a reduction in port charges billed to us by bt 
ireland for the year ended december   revenue from ireland customers increased by to million from million for  and revenue from ireland customers expressed in pounds sterling increased by to million from million during the same period  and revenue from ireland customers expressed in euros increased by to million from million during the same period 
the primary reasons for the increase were more sales of premium services  including digital television  to existing customers  a price increase that became effective in january  and higher business sector revenue 
expenses operating costs 
for the year ended december   operating costs  including network expenses  increased by to  million from  million in  and operating costs expressed in pounds sterling decreased by to million from million 
operating costs as a percentage of revenue declined to for the year ended december   from for the decrease in operating costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily a result of reductions in television programming costs because of renegotiated contracts  which included expanded channel line ups  and in telephone interconnection costs as a result of our effort to route our outbound traffic more effectively and the recent regulatory authority ruling related to mobile interconnect cost reductions 
the increase in revenue from broadband internet services also contributed to the decrease in operating costs as a percentage of revenue  as the margin on this revenue is higher than other products 
in addition  we experienced lower costs as we continued to focus on a smaller but more profitable base of business customers 
we also benefited from a release of certain accruals in respect of interconnection and related charges which are no longer required 
finally  we benefited from a reduction in charges from local authorities in respect of rates payable on our network  and in port charges previously billed to us following the oftel investigation into bt s pricing formula 
these reductions were partly offset by the expensing of costs that were no longer applicable to capital activities and therefore no longer capitalized  together with the impact of the release of certain balance sheet provisions in which were not repeated in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million in  and selling  general and administrative expenses expressed in pounds sterling increased by to million from million 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december   from for the increase in these expenses was primarily because of higher marketing and selling activities in which were curtailed in as a result of our reorganization 
in addition employee costs increased in compared with due to implementation of incentive compensation plans 
these included increased bonus costs as a result of performance achievements above target  introduction of a long term incentive plan  and the adoption of fas we also incurred increased pension costs in respect of our defined benefit schemes 
finally  selling general and administrative costs increased because of the expensing of costs that were no longer applicable to capital activities and therefore no longer capitalized  and the releases of certain balance sheet provisions in which were not repeated in these increases were partially offset by savings arising from our successful renegotiation of our contract with ibm for outsourced information technology services  together with reduced employee costs relating to our business customers as a result of the restructuring at the end of and during in addition  we also benefited from reduced costs through lower bad debt charges and other operational savings  together with reduced property and facility costs

amortization expense for the year ended december   amortization expense increased to million from million in this increase in amortization expense was as a result of the million increase in the carrying value of our customer lists as of january  because of the adoption of fresh start reporting  which is amortized over three to five years 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense decreased to million from million in  primarily as a result of the cancellation of  million of debt on january  in connection with our emergence from chapter reorganization 
in the year ended december   interest expense included interest on this debt only through to may  pursuant to sop  in the period from may  to december   interest expense was included in the results of operations only to the extent that it would be paid during the bankruptcy proceeding or that it was probable that it would be an allowed priority  secured or unsecured claim 
accordingly  interest expense for the year ended december  excluded million of contractual interest 
the saving in interest from the cancellation of debt on january  was partly offset by interest on the exit notes issued in january through to november when they were repaid  accretion charges in respect of fresh start adjustments to the carrying values of diamond holdings and ntl triangle notes  adverse movements in exchange rates causing the us dollar equivalent of our sterling interest expense to increase  the amendment and restatement of our then existing senior and working capital facilities in january  that increased the rate of interest payable on these facilities  the amortization of certain costs incurred in connection with this amendment to the senior and working credit facilities  and a reduction in the amount of interest capitalized in we paid interest in cash of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  with respect to the interest payment of million on the exit notes due on july   we elected to pay the interest through the issuance of additional pay in kind notes

this expense included million for employee retention related to substantially all of our uk employees and million for financial advisory  legal  accounting and consulting costs 
foreign currency transaction gains losses for the year ended december   foreign currency transaction gains were million as compared with losses of million for these gains in were primarily because of the effect of changes in exchange rates on us dollar denominated debt of our subsidiaries  diamond holdings and ntl triangle  whose functional currency is the pound sterling

statement of cash flows cash flow information provided below includes continuing and discontinued operations 
year ended december  and for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities increased to million from million for the same period in this increase was a result of the improvement in operating results and lower interest payments 
for the year ended december   cash paid for interest  exclusive of amounts capitalized  decreased to million from million during the same period in this decrease resulted from lower level of debt  lower weighted average interest rates and re scheduling of interest payments following our refinancing transaction 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities increased to million from million for the same period in the increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of the virgin 
net isp and the purchase of marketable securities  mitigated by a reduction in purchases of fixed assets and repayment of loans made to unconsolidated affiliates 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared with cash provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december  the principal components of the million cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  relate to our refinancing transaction completed in april as follows  million million was raised from the issuance of senior notes by our subsidiary  ntl cable plc   million  million was drawn under the new senior credit facility  which together with some of the proceeds of the issuance of the senior notes and cash on hand  was used to repay in full our then existing senior credit facility  and the remaining proceeds from the notes offering  together with cash on hand  was used to redeem the diamond notes and ntl triangle debentures and pay transaction costs 
for the year ended december   cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from the rights offering  from which we raised approximately  million after expenses and used the proceeds  together with cash on hand  to repay indebtedness 
year ended december  and for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities increased to million from million in  because of the improvement in operating results and a reduction in investment in working capital as a result of the timing of receipts and disbursements 
for the year ended december   cash paid for interest  exclusive of amounts capitalized  increased to million from million in primarily as a result of our resumption of payment of interest due on our outstanding debt when we emerged from bankruptcy on january  these payments were suspended during our reorganization process 
in addition  the amendment and restatement of our senior and working capital credit facilities in january increased the rate of interest and unfavorable movements in exchange rates increased the us dollar equivalent of our sterling debt interest payments 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities decreased to million from million in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   included million of restricted cash drawn under the dip facility see our restructuring 
the dip facility was repaid on the effective date of our reorganization from chapter purchases of fixed assets for the year ended december   which are primarily related to customer premise equipment  were lower than in during  we continued to restrict purchases of fixed assets in an effort to conserve cash 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million cash provided for the year ended december  the principal components of the million cash provided by financing activities in were as follows on november   we completed a rights offering  receiving gross proceeds of  million and approximately  million after expenses from the exercise of rights  and from the proceeds of the rights offering  we repaid in full all our obligations under our exit notes of million and  together with cash on hand  our working capital credit facility of million 
we also made principal payments on some of our capital leases 
the principal components of the million cash provided in were as follows proceeds from borrowings  net of financing costs  of million  which included million borrowed under our working capital facility  net of costs of million  and million borrowed under our dip facility  net of costs of million  and proceeds from borrowings from ntl delaware of million comprising the million loan to our subsidiary ntl uk group  inc this note was purchased on january  pursuant to the reorganization under chapter by one of our subsidiaries for cash consideration equal to the principal amount of the note plus accrued interest 
liquidity and capital resources in november we completed our rights offering from which we received gross proceeds of billion 
we used the net proceeds to repay in excess of billion of indebtedness 
in the second quarter of  we completed our refinancing transaction from which we raised approximately billion indebtedness 
the refinancing transaction extended the maturities on substantially all of our debt and lowered our weighted average interest expense 
in particular on april   our wholly owned  newly formed subsidiary  ntl cable plc  issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due  together referred to as the senior notes 
the senior notes were offered and sold under rule a and regulation s 
also  on april   we entered into a new fully underwritten  million senior secured credit facility  which includes a million revolving tranche 
on april  we drew down  million of our senior credit facility  which  together with some of the proceeds from the issuance of the new notes and cash on hand  we used to repay our then existing senior credit facility 
the remaining proceeds from the notes offering  together with cash on hand  were used on may  to redeem the diamond notes  redeem the triangle debentures  and pay transaction costs 
the redemption of the diamond notes and the triangle debentures on may   as well as making diamond cable communications limited and its direct or indirect subsidiaries wholly owned subsidiaries of ntl cable plc as required by the terms of the indenture governing the notes and our senior credit facility  has provided us with additional flexibility to engage in intercompany transfer of funds and other transactions 
the terms of the indenture governing the senior notes and our senior credit facility permitted us to operate our broadcast operations as a stand alone business not subject to the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture and our senior credit facility 
the agreements governing the senior notes and our senior credit facility significantly and  in some cases  absolutely restrict our ability and the ability of most of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  or redeem or repurchase equity interests or subordinated obligations  make investments  sell assets  including the capital stock of subsidiaries  enter into sale leaseback transactions  create liens  enter into agreements that restrict the restricted subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  transfer assets or make intercompany loans  merge or consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of its assets  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
our business is capital intensive  we are highly leveraged  and we have historically incurred operating losses and negative cash flow  partly as a result of our construction costs  operating expenditures and interest costs 
we require significant amounts of capital to connect customers to our network  expand and upgrade our network  offer new services and integrate our billing systems and customer databases 
in  we expect to spend between million and million  or between million and million  on acquiring fixed assets 
we must also regularly service interest payments with cash flows from operations 
our ability to sustain operations  meet financial covenants under our indebtedness  and make required payments on our indebtedness could be impaired if we are unable to maintain or achieve various financial performance measures 
our ability to service our capital needs  to service our obligations under our indebtedness and to fund our ongoing operations will depend upon our ability to generate cash 
for the year ended december   our cash decreased by million  however  this was principally because of the refinancing transaction in april and repayments of debt in the first quarter of although we expect to generate positive cash flow in the future  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with cash from operations and  if required  drawdowns under the million revolving tranche of our credit facility  will be sufficient for our cash requirements through at least march  however  our cash requirements after march  may exceed these sources of cash 
this may require that we obtain additional financing in excess of the financing incurred in the refinancing transaction 
we may not be able to obtain financing at all  or on favorable terms  or we may be contractually prevented by the terms of the senior notes or our senior credit facility from incurring additional indebtedness 
we are a holding company with no independent operations or significant assets other than our investments in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we will depend upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
in addition  the terms of our and our subsidiaries existing and future indebtedness and the laws of the jurisdictions under which those subsidiaries are organized limit the payment of dividends  loan repayments and other distributions to us under many circumstances 
our debt agreements and the debt agreements of some of our subsidiaries contain restrictions on our ability to transfer cash between groups of our subsidiaries 
as a result of these restrictions  although our overall liquidity may be sufficient to satisfy our obligations  we may be limited by covenants in some of our debt agreements from transferring cash to other subsidiaries that might require funds 
in addition  cross default provisions in our other indebtedness may be triggered if we default on any of these debt agreements 
at december   all of our defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations exceeding plan assets totaling million 
we will need to fund these deficits in accordance with the laws and regulations of the uk and the republic of ireland 
we expect to contribute a total of million  or million  in  of which million  or million  represents a single contribution agreed to with trustees of our pension plans  in order to reduce the deficit in two of our pension plans  including million  or million  to be paid to our largest defined benefit pension plan 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in the refinancing transaction  we incurred obligations in a combination of us dollars  euros and pound sterling at fixed and variable interest rates 
as a result we are exposed to variability in our cash flows and earnings resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we have entered into a number of derivative instruments with a number of counter parties to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
interest rate swaps we have entered into a number of interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in future interest payments on the senior credit facility which accrues interest at variable rates based on libor 
the interest rate swaps allow us to receive interest based on libor in exchange for payments of interest at fixed rates of and 
the net settlement of million under the interest rate swaps is included within interest expense 
we have designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under fas because they hedge against changes in libor 
the interest rate swaps are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value are recorded within other comprehensive income loss 
cross currency interest rate swaps we have entered into a number of cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in the pound sterling value of interest payments on the senior notes due  the interest payments on the floating rate senior notes due  and variable rate based on libor interest payments on the senior credit facility due  denominated in us dollars and euros 
under the cross currency interest rate swaps we receive interest in us dollars at a rate of  and us dollar and euros at a variable rate based on libor  and we pay interest in pound sterling at a rate of  and at a variable rate based on libor 
the net settlement of million under the cross currency interest rate swap is included within interest expense 
we have designated the cross currency interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under fas because they hedge against changes in the pound sterling value of the interest payments on the senior notes and senior credit facility that result from changes in the us dollar  pound sterling and euro exchange rates 
the cross currency interest rate swaps are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value are recorded within other comprehensive income loss 
foreign currency forward contracts we have entered into a number of forward contracts maturing on april  to purchase a total of million and million 
the contracts hedge the variability in the pound sterling value of the principal obligation of the senior notes and on the senior credit facility based on a variable rate of libor  resulting from changes in the us dollar  pound sterling and euro exchange rates 
on january  we announced that we intended to use up to million of the proceeds from the sale of our broadcast operations to repurchase shares of our common stock 
we have also entered into forward contracts maturing in march to sell a total of million and option contracts to sell an additional million 
these contracts are associated with the stock repurchase program and hedge the pound sterling value of our stock price 
the forward contracts are not effective as hedges under fas the forward contracts are still recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value but changes in the fair value are reported in the income statement 
however  the forward contracts do not subject us to material volatility in our earnings and cash flows because changes in the fair value directionally and partially mitigate the gains or losses on the translation of the us dollar and euro denominated senior notes and senior credit facility into pounds sterling

the fair value of the guarantees has been calculated by reference to the monetary value of each bond 
our restructuring both the equity and debt capital markets experienced periods of significant volatility in and  particularly for securities issued by telecommunications and technology companies 
as a result  the ability of our former parent company and its subsidiaries to access those markets as well as its ability to obtain financing from its bank lenders and equipment suppliers became severely restricted 
in addition  our former parent company and its subsidiaries  including us  had no further funds available  or were unable to draw upon funds under our credit facilities 
as a result of these factors  together with its substantial leverage  on january   our former parent company announced that it had appointed professional advisors to advise on strategic and recapitalization alternatives to strengthen its balance sheet  reduce debt and put an appropriate capital structure in place for its business 
promptly upon obtaining the requisite waivers from the lenders under its credit facilities  in march  our former parent company commenced negotiations with a steering committee of the unofficial committee of its bondholders and the committee s legal and financial advisors 
our former parent company and its subsidiaries failed to make interest payments on some of the outstanding notes starting on april  our former parent company also failed to declare or pay dividends on certain series of its outstanding preferred stock  due to a lack of available surplus under delaware law 
on april   our former parent company announced that it and the unofficial committee of its bondholders had reached an agreement in principle on a comprehensive recapitalization of the former ntl group 
to implement the proposed recapitalization plan  on may   we  our former parent company and certain of our former parent company s other subsidiaries filed cases and a pre arranged joint reorganization plan under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
in connection with the filing  some members of the unofficial creditors committee of bondholders entered into a credit facility agreement  referred to in this form k as the dip facility  committing to provide a wholly owned subsidiary of ours with up to million in new debt financing 
ntl delaware committed to provide up to an additional million to us under the dip facility 
as a result of the payment defaults as well as the voluntary filing under chapter by our former parent company and certain of its subsidiaries on may   there was an event of default under all of our former parent company s and its subsidiaries principal credit facilities and the indentures governing all of their publicly traded debt  other than debt of ntl triangle 
the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan on september  during the fall of  our former parent company negotiated with a group of lenders to enter into a new financing arrangement to repay the dip facility  to repay various obligations and to provide liquidity to our subsidiaries and us 
the plan became effective on january   at which time we emerged from chapter reorganization 
in connection with our emergence from chapter reorganization  we issued million aggregate principal face amount of the exit notes on january  initial purchasers of the exit notes also purchased  shares of our common stock on that date 
the gross proceeds from the sale of the exit notes and these  shares totaled million 
the proceeds were used in part to repay all amounts outstanding under the dip facility  to purchase from ntl delaware a million note of ntl uk group  inc  one of our subsidiaries  and to repay certain other obligations 
also on january   our lending banks and we amended our existing credit facilities 
fresh start reporting we operated our business as a debtor in possession subject to the jurisdiction of the us bankruptcy court during the period from may  until january  accordingly  our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our emergence from chapter reorganization were prepared in accordance with sop in addition  we adopted fresh start reporting upon our emergence from chapter reorganization in accordance with sop for financial reporting purposes  the effects of the completion of the plan as well as adjustments for fresh start reporting have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of january  pursuant to fresh start reporting  a new entity was deemed created for financial reporting purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  like foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we encounter currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenues and operating costs are earned and paid primarily in pounds and  to a lesser extent  euros  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our existing indebtedness in us dollars 
to the extent that the pound declines in value against the us dollar  the effective cost of servicing our us dollar debt will be higher 
changes in the exchange rate result in foreign currency gains or losses 
as of december   million  or of our long term debt was in us dollars
