item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements  all included herein 
the information set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
many factors  including but not limited to those discussed below under factors that may affect future results could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements 
overview flanders is a full range air filtration product company engaged in designing  manufacturing and marketing air filtration products and certain related products and services 
our focus has evolved from expansion through acquisition to increasing the quality and efficiency of our high volume replacement filtration products  and using these benefits to compete more effectively in the marketplace 
we also design and manufacture much of our own production equipment as well as glass based media for many of our air filtration products 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  and assets and liabilities during the periods reported 
estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as revenues  allowances for returns  early payment discounts  customer discounts  doubtful accounts  employee compensation programs  depreciation and amortization periods  taxes  inventory values  insurance programs  and valuations of investments  goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we write down inventory balances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimates of our insurance costs are developed by management s evaluation of the likelihood and probable amount of potential claims based on historical experience and evaluation of each claim 
changes in the key assumptions may occur in the future  which would result in changes to related insurance costs 
goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that the company s carrying amount is greater than the fair value 
the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas as of january  in accordance with sfas  the company examined goodwill for impairment and determined that the company s carrying amount exceeded the fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its transitional impairment analysis 
an independent third party performed valuations of the company 
the third party performing the valuation concluded  based on various methodologies  that the fair value of the company exceeded its carrying value  and thus  there was no goodwill impairment 
in addition  the company s independent certifying accountants  in accordance with sas using the work of a specialist  evaluated the professional qualifications of the third party evaluator  gained an understanding of the work performed  which included an understanding of the specialist s work  methods  and assumptions used and made appropriate tests of data provided to the specialists 
the independent certifying accountants concluded that the specialist s findings were supported by the data provided 
however  according to sfas  quoted market prices in active ma rkets are the best evidence of fair value  and thus the company  with the concurrence of the company s independent certifying accountants  concluded that the higher fair value  as determined by the third party valuation  is not sufficient to outweigh the presumption of fair value indicated by the quoted market price of the company 
accordingly  the company determined that an impairment charge upon the adoption of sfas on january  was necessary 
generally  sales are recognized when shipments are made to customers 
rebates  allowances for damaged goods and other advertising and marketing program rebates are accrued pursuant to contractual provisions and included in accrued expenses 
an insignificant amount of our revenues fall under the percentage of completion method of accounting used for long term contracts 
under this method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values 
estimated losses are recorded when identified 
results of operations thousands omitted  except per share amounts compared to the following table summarizes the company s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for and net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income nonoperating income expense earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings loss net sales net sales for increased by  or  to  from  for the increase in net sales was due to our success in increasing our market share across generally all lines of our business 
gross profit gross profit for increased  or  to  which made up of net sales  from  for  which made up of net sales 
the gross profit increase was principally due to a higher sales volume and cost reductions attributable to reductions in raw material expenses due to in house production of various raw materials 
reductions in direct labor force headcount and better utilization of our automated equipment 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased  or  to  from  in the increase in operating expenses was primarily caused by a higher sales volume in operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in to from due primarily to a reduction of bad debt expense from of approximately million in to million in nonoperating income expense nonoperating income expense decreased approximately to of expense for  compared to of income in the decrease was due to a reduction of other income partially offset by a reduction of interest exepnse of approximately provision for income taxes our effective state and federal tax rate  adjusted for the effect of certain one time credits and adjustments  was approximately and for and  respectively 
compared to the following table summarizes the company s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for and dollar amounts in thousands

earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes earnings loss from continuing operations cumulative effect of accounting change net earnings loss net sales net sales for decreased by  or  to  from  for the decrease in net sales was due to a general decrease in air filter sales across the industry which began in the fourth quarter of and the elimination of unprofitable product lines  partially balanced by our success in increasing our market share 
gross profit gross profit for increased  or  to  which made up of net sales  from  for  which made up of net sales 
the gross profit increase was principally attributable to reductions in raw material expenses due to in house production of various raw materials 
reductions in direct labor force headcount and better utilization of our automated equipment 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased  or  to  from  in the increase in operating expenses was primarily caused by an unusually high bad debt expense of approximately million which management believes is a symptom of the general downturn in the air filtration industry 
nonoperating income expense nonoperating income expense increased approximately  to of income for  compared to net expense of  in the increase was primarily due to a reduction of interest expense of approximately million dollars

effects of inflation the company s business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
liquidity and capital resources dollar amounts in thousands working capital was  at december   compared to  at december  this included cash and cash equivalents of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the increase in working capital was cash flows generated from operations net of amounts used to purchase equipment and reduce debt 
trade receivables increased  or at december  from  at december  the increase in accounts receivable is attributable to increased sales volume and the aging of various accounts along with the timing differences in shipments and payments received 
continuing operations generated  of cash in  compared to  of cash in the difference in cash flows was primarily related to increases in inventory and receivables partially offset by higher operating income 
investing activities for continuing operations consumed  of cash during  compared to consuming  during  consisting primarily of the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities for continuing operations consumed and  of cash in and  respectively  consisting primarily of payments on long term debt 
on october   we signed agreements for a new credit facility with fleet capital corporation  which replaced and repaid our previous million revolving credit facility 
the new million facility consists of a million term loan and a million revolving credit line  both of which expire on october  the term loan bears interest  at our option  at either i libor plus between and  dependent on the company s fixed charge coverage during the prior twelve months  or ii the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus or fleet s base rate  plus between and  dependent on the company s fixed charge coverage during the prior twelve months 
the million revolving credit facility bears interest at less than the term loan 
up to million of the revolving credit facility may be used to issue letters of credit 
the facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
t he line of credit agreement requires maintenance of certain financial ratios  and restricts capital expenditures  dividends and share repurchases 
unless this credit facility is renewed  it will expire on october  there are no prepayment penalties on any of the credit facilities with fleet capital corporation 
in connection with the amended working capital credit facility and notes payable to a regional development authority and bank  the company has agreed to certain restrictive covenants which include  among other things  restricting capital expenditures to less than  for and  per year  thereafter  not paying dividends or repurchasing its stock without prior written consent  and maintenance of certain financial ratios at all times including a minimum current ratio  minimum tangible net worth  a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
as of december  we had the following fixed obligations and commitments year ended december  operating leases capital leases long term debt other long term obligations thereafter we believe that our cash on hand  cash generated by operations  and cash available from our existing credit facilities is sufficient to meet the capital demands of our current operations during the fiscal year 
any major increases in sales  particularly in new products  may require substantial capital investment for the manufacture of filtration products 
failure to obtain sufficient capital could materially adversely impact our growth potential 
we are currently considering paying cash dividends in the future to holders of our common stock 
under the terms of our revolving credit line we cannot pay dividends without the prior written consent of the bank 
in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of our common stock  which repurchase was completed in september on september   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional two million shares of common stock through open market or negotiated transactions 
further repurchases under this program are restricted under our current line of credit agreement  and require prior consent of fleet capital corporation 
as of february   approximately  shares had been repurchased in the open market under this authorization 
outlook during global containment systems  inc gcs  a wholly owned subsidiary of flanders corporation  was formed 
gcs will expand its operations into a  square foot facility in aiken  sc 
this facility will accommodate the requirements for various nuclear containment projects scheduled at the westinghouse savannah river site in aiken  sc as well as other projects scheduled worldwide over the next ten years 
the expansion into south carolina will provide a state of the art facility with room necessary to provide in place testing  integration  process control verification and final testing and final installation which is expected to provide gcs a unique position in this developing market 
additionally  during  flanders complete service division flanders csd  an air filtration service provider was formed 
flanders csd will offer weekly  monthly and quarterly service contracts for clean room and glove box certification  commercial  industrial  retail and residential surveys  and complete filtration management including mold remediation and analysis 
based on the breadth of the company s existing manufacturing plants  the company expects to have national coverage by the end of during the past three years  we have captured additional market share among big box retailers like the home depot and wal mart  capitalizing on our ability to service national accounts from regional distribution centers and our improved on time delivery performance 
we anticipate additional market gains among these types of retailers during the next two years and are introducing new products focused on their marketing and end user requirements 
sales to these retail outlets  while seasonal  also tend to follow progress in the overall economy 
additional gains in market share in this segment may not have a significant impact on revenues without some recovery in the overall us economy 
additionally  significant revenue enhancement to these customers is largely dependent upon the success of the new products we are introducing to this marketplace 
during the past three years  we introduced air filtration products which use the arm hammer brand name 
we have recently completed development of antimicrobial air filtration products using the lysol brand name 
these products are expected to contribute to our expansion in the retail marketplace  but the extent to which they will do so  and their impact on the bottom line  is currently indeterminable 
we have adapted our biocontainment products for use as part of a system for hardening government buildings  commercial office complexes and public venues against airborne bioweapons such as anthrax and smallpox 
there is currently an increase of interest in these products over the past quarter 
any interest towards hardening these types of facilities against airborne bioweapons could have a significant impact on our business 
sales of air filtration products for semiconductor facilities  historically a major market  are expected to be slow again during the first six months of  with most analysts pushing recovery for this sector out to at least the fourth quarter however  the strengthening economy is also having a positive effect on sales of all our products 
we have collected data that indicates that residential filter users replace their filters  on average  approximately one and a half times per year 
manufacturers of residential furnace and air conditioning systems recommend that these filters be changed every month 
a minor trend toward increased maintenance of these residential heating and cooling systems could have a positive impact on our business 
our most common products  in terms of both unit and dollar volume  are residential throw away spun glass filters  which usually sell for prices under 
any increase in consumer concern regarding air pollution  airborne pollens  allergens  and other residential airborne contaminants could result in replacement of some of these products with higher value products 
our higher value products include our naturalaire higher efficiency filters for residential use  and our lysol and arm hammer co branded products  with associated sales prices typically over each 
any such trend would have a beneficial effect on our business 
we believe there is currently a gradually increasing public awareness of the issues surrounding indoor air quality and that this trend will continue for the next several years 
we also believe there is an increase in public concern regarding the effects of indoor air quality on employee productivity  as well as an increase in interest by standards making bodies in creating specifications and techniques for detecting  defining and solving indoor air quality problems 
we further believe there will be an increase in interest in our absolute isolation barriers in the future because these products may be used in both semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants to prevent cross contamination between different lots and different processes being performed at the same facility 
these products also increase production yields in many applications 
currently  the largest domestic market for air filtration products is for mid range ashrae rated products and hvac systems  typically used in commercial and industrial buildings 
to date  our penetration of this market has been relatively small 
we believe our ability to offer a one stop supply of air filtration products to hvac distributors and wholesalers may increase our share of this market 
we also believe that our recently developed modular air handlers and environmental tobacco smoke systems will enable us to expand sales to these customers 
we intend our new products to serve as high profile entrants with distributors and manufacturers representatives  who can then be motivated to carry our complete product line 
we have continually looked for cost reductions in our products 
during the past five years  we have continued to complete the development and redesigning of numerous systems and products which were only partially completed when we acquired the companies which originally claimed to have fully developed them 
these products include the automated machinery necessary for high speed production of our pleated filters  acquired with precisionaire  and the mass production processes for bonded carbon high mass zero density products 
during  we are expecting to move from semi automated lines to fully automated production lines which is expected to significantly reduce our labor related costs this outlook section  and other portions of this document  include certain forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of  including  among others  those statements preceded by  following or including the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate or similar expressions 
these forward looking statements are based largely on the current expectations of management and are subject to a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include those discussed below under the heading factors that may affect future results as well as the shortage of reliable market data regarding the air filtration market  changes in external competitive market factors or in our internal budgeting process which might impact trends in our results of operations  anticipated working capital or other cash requirements  changes in our business strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in the market  product obsolescence due to the development of new technologies  and various competitive factors that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the events contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this form k will in fact occur 
factors that may affect future results failure to manage future growth could adversely impact our business due to the strain on our management  financial and other resources if our business expands in the future  the additional growth will place burdens on management to manage such growth while maintaining profitability 
our ability to compete effectively and manage future growth depends on our ability to recruit  train and manage our work force  particularly in the areas of corporate management  accounting  research and development and operations  manage production and inventory levels to meet product demand  manage and improve production quality  expand both the range of customers and the geographic scope of our customer base  and improve financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
any failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any delay in procuring financing for new products or failure to adequately ramp up production capacity to meet demand could adversely impact our business due to strain on financial resources 
during and  we plan to introduce and market various products which  if successful  may require additional financing and or capital 
this financing may need to be available on short notice 
any failure to obtain such financing  or delay in financing  could cause the failure of the new products due to inability to deliver on time  and could adversely impact relationships with current major accounts 
in addition  delays in an untried supply chain  new production chains  and other delays common to the launch of a new product line could also adversely impact the success of the products  as well as current relationships with major accounts 
our business may suffer if our competitive strategy is not successful our continued success depends on our ability to compete in an industry that is highly competitive 
this competition may increase as new competitors enter the market 
several of our competitors may have longer operating histories and greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
additionally  our competitors may introduce new products or enhancements to products that could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products 
under our current competitive strategy  we endeavor to remain competitive by increasing our market share  expanding our market through the introduction of new products which require periodic replacement  and improving operating efficiencies 
although our executive management team continues to review and monitor our strategic plans  we have no assurance that we will be able to follow our current strategy or that this strategy will be successful 
our market share may not continue to increase if we are unable to acquire additional synergistic businesses in the past several years  we have significantly increased our market share by acquiring synergistic businesses 
although we intend to continue to increase our market share in this manner  we have no assurance that future acquisition opportunities will be available  and do not anticipate that future acquisitions will be of a size which would result in immediate significant increases in the size of our business 
additionally  in the future we may not have access to the substantial debt or equity financing to finance potential acquisitions 
moreover  these types of transactions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt and other acquisition related expenses  all of which could adversely affect our profitability or cash flows 
our strategy of growth through acquisition also exposes us to the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  and potential profitabi lity of acquisition candidates and in integrating the operations of acquired companies 
we do not currently have any binding agreements with respect to future acquisitions 
our business may suffer if our strategy to increase the size and customer base of the air filtration market is unsuccessful we are developing new products as part of our strategy to increase the size and customer base of the air filtration market 
we have no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
we have no guarantee that any new products we develop will gain acceptance in the marketplace  or that these products will be successful 
additionally  we have no assurance we will be able to recoup the expenditures associated with the development of these products 
to succeed in this area we must increase public awareness of the issues surrounding indoor air quality  adequately address the unknown requirements of the potential customer base  develop new products that are competitive in terms of price  performance and quality  and avoid significant increases in current expenditure levels in development  marketing and consumer education 
we may experience critical equipment failure which could have a material adverse effect on our business if we experience extended periods of downtime due to the malfunction or failure of our automated production equipment  our business  financial condition and operations may suffer 
we design and manufacture much of the automated production equipment used in our facilities 
we also use other technologically advanced equipment for which manufacturers may have limited production capability or service experience 
if we are unable to quickly repair our equipment or quickly obtain new equipment or parts from outside manufacturers  we could experience extended periods of downtime in the event of malfunction or equipment failure 
our plan to centralize overhead functions may not produce the anticipated benefits to our operating results we are currently completing the implementation of plans to centralize overhead functions and eliminate duplication of efforts between our subsidiaries in the following areas purchasing  production planning  shipping coordination  marketing  accounting  personnel management  risk management  and benefit plan administration 
we have no assurance that cutting overhead in this fashion will have the anticipated benefits to our operating results 
additionally  we have no assurance that these reorganizations will not significantly disrupt the operations of the affected subsidiaries 
our success depends on our ability to retain and attract key personnel our success and future operating results depend in part upon our ability to retain our executives and key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
our success also depends on our ability to attract highly qualified engineering  manufacturing  technical  sales and support personnel for our operations 
competition for such personnel  particularly qualified engineers  is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
our failure to attract or retain such persons could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our current distribution channels may be unavailable if our manufacturers representatives decide to work primarily with one of our competitors we provide our manufacturers representatives with the ability to offer a full product line of air filtration products to existing and new customers 
some of our competitors offer similar arrangements 
we do not have exclusive relationships with all of our representatives 
consequently  if our representatives decide to work primarily with one of our competitors  our current distribution channels  and hence  our sales  could be significantly reduced 
management controls a significant percentage of our stock as of december   our directors and executive officers beneficially held approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  such shareholders effectively control or significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval 
these matters include the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that may otherwise be advantageous to the non affiliated shareholders 
we may be required to issue stock in the future that will dilute the value of our existing stock we have granted options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock to various parties with exercise prices ranging from to per share 
the majority of these options are currently exercisable 
additionally  if the option holders exercise their options  the interests of current shareholders may be diluted 
our shareholders may not realize certain opportunities because of our charter provisions and north carolina law our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that are designed to provide our board of directors with time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders 
these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control in our business 
additionally  we are subject to the control shares acquisition act of the state of north carolina 
this act provides that any person who acquires control shares of a publicly held north carolina corporation will not have voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested shareholders of the corporation vote to grant such rights 
this could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or other advantages that large accumulations of stock would typically provide 
our business can be significantly affected by environmental laws the constantly changing body of environmental laws and regulations may significantly influence our business and products 
these laws and regulations require that various environmental standards be met and impose liability for the failure to comply with such standards 
while we endeavor at each of our facilities to assure compliance with environmental laws and regulations  and are currently not aware of any ongoing issues of this nature  we cannot be certain that our operations or activities  or historical operations by others at our locations  will not result in civil or criminal enforcement actions or private actions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
we have  in the past  and may  in the future  purchase or lease properties with unresolved potential violations of federal or state environmental regulations 
in these transactions  we have been successful in obtaining sufficient indemnification and mitigating the impact of the issues without recognizing significant expenses associated with litigation and cleanup 
however  purchasing or leasing these properties requires us to weigh the cost of resolving these issues and the likelihood of litigation against the potential economic and business benefits of the transaction 
if we fail to correctly identify  resolve and obtain indemnification against these risks  they could have a material adverse impact on our financial position 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands we are exposed to various market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse change in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
for flanders  these exposures are primarily related to changes in interest rates 
we do not hold any derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the company s total long term debt  including capital leases and current maturities of long term debt  at december  was  market risk was estimated as the potential decrease increase in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase decrease in the company s estimated weighted average borrowing rate at december  although most of the interest on the company s debt is indexed to a market rate  there would be no material effect on the future earnings or cash flows related to the company s total debt for such a hypothetical change 
we have only a limited involvement with derivative financial instruments 
we have two interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the potential impact on earnings from increases in market interest rates of two variable rate bonds 
under the interest rate swap agreements  we receive or make payments on a monthly basis  based on the differential between and a tax exempt interest rate as determined by a remarketing agent 
this interest rate swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas and sfas gains or losses related to inefficiencies of the cash flow hedge were included in net income during the period related to hedge ineffectiveness 
the tax affected fair market value of the interest rate swap of  is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet 
the interest rate swap contracts expire in and the company s financial position is not materially affected by fluctuations in currencies against the us dollar  since assets held outside the united states are negligible 
risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are negligible  as the preponderance of our foreign sales occur over short periods of time or are demarcated in us dollars
