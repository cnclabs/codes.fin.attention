liability and insurance matters 
in  congress enacted the price anderson act as an amendment to the atomic energy act of to provide a system of financial protection for persons who may be injured or persons who may be liable for a nuclear incident 
the price anderson act expired on december  existing licensees  such as the company  are grandfathered and will continue to be subject to the provisions of the price anderson act in the event congress does not reauthorize the price anderson act 
despite extensive debate  the th congress adjourned without passing comprehensive energy legislation which would have extended the price anderson act 
while introduction of energy legislation in the th congress is pending  it remains unclear what its course may be 
proposals to separate less controversial provisions such as the reauthorization of the price anderson act from the comprehensive legislation were resisted by the house and senate leadership 
current versions of energy omnibus legislation  if passed  would provide for the reauthorization of the price anderson act  thus amending the atomic energy act to i increase from million to million the maximum amount of standard deferred premiums charged a licensee following any nuclear incident under an industry retrospective rating plan and ii increase from million to million adjusted for inflation in any one year the maximum amount of such premiums for each

the aggregate amount of doe indemnification currently available to all licensees under the price anderson act is billion 
additionally  the palo verde participants have public liability insurance against nuclear energy hazards up to the full limit of liability under the price anderson act 
the insurance consists of million of primary liability insurance provided by commercial insurance carriers  with the balance being provided by an industry wide retrospective assessment program  pursuant to which industry participants would be required to pay a retrospective assessment to cover any loss in excess of million 
presently  the maximum retrospective assessment per reactor for each nuclear incident is approximately million  subject to an annual limit of million per incident 
based upon the company s interest in palo verde  the company s maximum potential retrospective assessment per incident is approximately million for all three units with an annual payment limitation of approximately million 
the palo verde participants maintain all risk including nuclear hazards insurance for damage to  and decontamination of  property at palo verde in the aggregate amount of billion  a substantial portion of which must first be applied to stabilization and decontamination 
the company also has obtained insurance against a portion of any increased cost of generation or purchased power which may result from an accidental outage of any of the three palo verde units if the outage exceeds weeks

environmental matters the company is subject to regulation with respect to air  soil and water quality  solid waste disposal and other environmental matters by federal  state  tribal and local authorities 
those authorities govern current facility operations and have continuing jurisdiction over facility modifications 
failure to comply with these environmental regulatory requirements can result in actions by regulatory agencies or other authorities that might seek to impose on the company administrative  civil  and or criminal penalties 
if the united states regulates green house gas emissions  the company s fossil fuel generation assets will be faced with the additional cost of monitoring  controlling and reporting these emissions 
in addition  unauthorized releases of pollutants or contaminants into the environment can result in costly cleanup obligations that are subject to enforcement by the regulatory agencies 
environmental regulations can change rapidly and are often difficult to predict 
while the company strives to prepare for and implement changes necessary to comply with changing environmental regulations  substantial expenditures may be required for the company to comply with such regulations in the future 
the company analyzes the costs of its obligations arising from environmental matters on an ongoing basis and believes it has made adequate provision in its financial statements to meet such obligations 
as a result of this analysis  the company has a provision for environmental remediation obligations of approximately million as of december   which is related to compliance with federal and state environmental standards 
however  unforeseen expenses associated with compliance could have a material adverse effect on the future operations and financial condition of the company 
along with many other companies  the company received from the texas commission on environmental quality tceq a request for information dated october  in connection with environmental conditions at a facility in san angelo  texas that has been owned and operated by the san angelo electric service company sesco 
the company s written response to tceq notes that sesco performed repair services for certain company electrical equipment between and  prior to the company s bankruptcy 
although the sesco site has not been designated as a state or federal superfund site and the company has not been named as a responsible party or a potentially responsible party at that site  the company received in october an invitation to participate in site cleanup activities from a group of private companies that are conducting certain cleanup activities at the sesco site 
at this time  the company has not agreed to participate in the cleanup of the sesco site

index to financial statements and is unable to predict the outcome of this matter  although the company has no reason at present to believe that it will incur material liabilities in connection with the sesco site 
except as described herein  the company is not aware of any other active investigation of its compliance with environmental requirements by the environmental protection agency  the tceq or the new mexico environment department which is expected to result in any material liability 
furthermore  except as described herein  the company is not aware of any unresolved  potentially material liability it would face pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  comprehensive liability act of  also known as the superfund law 
construction program utility construction expenditures reflected in the following table consist primarily of local generation including cost of capacity to replace units to be retired  expanding and updating the transmission and distribution systems and the cost of capital improvements and replacements at palo verde  including the fabrication and installation of palo verde units and steam generators 
replacement power costs expected to be incurred during the replacement of palo verde steam generators are not included in construction costs 
studies indicate that the company will need additional supply side and demand side resources to meet increasing load requirements on its system 
as a result  the company is currently evaluating various alternatives to meet its load requirements  but those costs are not included in the table 
the company s estimated cash construction costs for through are approximately million 
actual costs may vary from the construction program estimates shown 
such estimates are reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changed conditions

nuclear fuel the nuclear fuel cycle for palo verde consists of the following stages the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates  the conversion of the uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride conversion services  the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride enrichment services  the fabrication of fuel assemblies fabrication services  the utilization of the fuel assemblies in the reactors  and the storage and disposal of the spent fuel 
the palo verde participants have contracts in place that will furnish of palo verde s operational requirements for uranium concentrates  conversion services and enrichment services through such contracts could also provide of enrichment services in and the palo verde participants have a contract for fabrication services through for each palo verde unit 
nuclear fuel financing 
pursuant to the anpp participation agreement  the company owns an undivided interest in nuclear fuel purchased in connection with palo verde 
the company has available a total of million under a revolving credit facility that provides for both working capital and up to million for the financing of nuclear fuel 
this facility was renewed in for a five year term ending december  at december   approximately million had been drawn to finance nuclear fuel 
this financing is accomplished through a trust that borrows under the credit facility to acquire and process the nuclear fuel 
the company is obligated to repay the trust s borrowings with interest and has secured this obligation with first mortgage collateral series bonds 
the company may request a release and return of the collateral provided that the company maintains certain credit ratings and meets other conditions 
in the company s financial statements  the assets and liabilities of the trust are consolidated and reported as assets and liabilities of the company

index to financial statements natural gas the company manages its natural gas requirements through a combination of a long term supply contract and spot market purchases 
the long term supply contract provides for firm deliveries of gas at market based index prices 
in  the company s natural gas requirements at the rio grande power station were met with both short term and long term natural gas purchases from various suppliers 
this is expected to continue in interstate gas is delivered under a base firm transportation contract that expires in july the company expects to renew this contract beyond  on terms to be negotiated between the parties 
the company anticipates it will continue to purchase natural gas at spot market prices on a monthly basis for a portion of the fuel needs for the rio grande power station for the near term 
the company will continue to evaluate the availability of short term natural gas supplies versus long term supplies to maintain a reliable and economical supply for the rio grande power station 
natural gas for the newman and copper power stations is primarily supplied pursuant to an intrastate natural gas contract that expires in the company will also continue to evaluate short term natural gas supplies to maintain a reliable and economical supply for the newman and copper power stations 
coal aps  as operating agent for four corners  purchases four corners coal requirements from a supplier with a long term lease of coal reserves owned by the navajo nation 
aps  on behalf of the company and the other four corners participants  has extended the four corners coal contract with the supplier to to coincide with the four corners plant lease with the navajo nation 
based upon information from aps  the company believes that four corners has sufficient reserves of coal to meet the plant s operational requirements for its useful life 
in the fourth quarter of  upon preliminary review of a study conducted by an outside engineering firm  the company increased its estimated final reclamation and coal mine closure liability related to the company s interest in four corners from million to million 
the million increase in pre tax dollars in its estimated reclamation and coal mine closure liability resulted in a million charge to energy expense and a million increase in regulatory assets 
purchased power to supplement its own generation and operating reserves  the company engages in firm and non firm power purchase arrangements which may vary in duration and amount based on evaluation of the company s resource needs and the economics of the transactions 
the company purchased mw of firm energy in and will continue to purchase an identical annual amount through based on a purchase agreement entered into in this agreement includes demand  energy and transmission charges 
in  the company entered into a year contract  beginning in  for the purchase of up to mw of capacity and associated energy from sps 
this contract includes a demand charge  energy charge and a transmission charge 
other purchases of shorter duration were made primarily to replace the company s generation resources during planned and unplanned outages

index to financial statements regulation general in  both the texas and new mexico legislatures enacted electric utility industry restructuring laws requiring competition in certain functions of the industry and ultimately in the company s service area 
in texas  the company has been exempt from the requirements of the texas restructuring law  including utility restructuring and retail competition 
the texas commission recently adopted a rule that would further delay competition in the company s texas service territory until at least the time that an independent regional transmission organization rto begins operation in its relevant power markets 
in april  the new mexico restructuring act was repealed and as a result  the company s operations in new mexico will continue to be fully regulated 
the company cannot predict at this time the full effects the repeal of the new mexico restructuring act will have on the company should it be required to ultimately implement the texas restructuring law 
federal regulatory matters federal energy regulatory commission 
the ferc has been conducting an investigation into potential manipulation of electricity prices in the western united states during and on august   the ferc initiated a federal power act fpa investigation into the company s wholesale power trading in the western united states during and to determine whether the company and enron engaged in misconduct and  if so  to determine potential remedies 
the company reached settlements with the ferc and other parties in and the company believes the ferc s order resolved all issues between the ferc and the other parties to this investigation 
under the settlements  the company agreed to refund million and to make wholesale sales pursuant to its cost of service rate authority rather than its market based rate authority for the period december  through december  this agreement allowed the company to sell power into wholesale markets at its incremental cost plus per mwh 
to the extent that wholesale market prices exceeded these agreed upon amounts  the company lost the opportunity to realize these additional revenues 
this provision did not have a significant impact on the company s revenues through december  the company s ability to make wholesale sales pursuant to its market based rate authority was restored on january  rtos 
ferc s rule order on rtos strongly encourages  but does not require  public utilities to form and join rtos 
the company is an active participant in the development of westconnect  formerly known as the desert southwest transmission and reliability operator 
as a participating transmission owner  the company will ultimately transfer operational authority of its transmission system to westconnect subject to receiving any necessary regulatory approvals 
on october   ferc issued an order indicating that the company s westconnect proposal satisfied  or with certain modifications would satisfy  the ferc requirements for an rto under order westconnect will continue to work with the ferc and two other proposed rtos in the west to achieve a seamless market structure 
the company  however  is anticipated to be no more than a participant in westconnect and cannot control the terms or timing of its establishment 
westconnect will not be operational for several years 
the establishment of an independent rto in the company s service area is a prerequisite for the company to be considered part of a qualified power region as defined in the

the timing of the operations of westconnect could affect when and whether the company s texas service territory is deregulated under the texas restructuring law 
department of energy 
the doe regulates the company s exports of power to the cfe in mexico pursuant to a license granted by the doe and a presidential permit 
the doe has determined that all such exports over international transmission lines shall be made in accordance with order no 
 which established the ferc rules for open access 
the doe is authorized to assess operators of nuclear generating facilities a share of the costs of decommissioning the doe s uranium enrichment facilities and for the ultimate costs of disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
see facilities palo verde station spent fuel storage for discussion of spent fuel storage and disposal costs 
nuclear regulatory commission 
the nrc has jurisdiction over the company s licenses for palo verde and regulates the operation of nuclear generating stations to protect the health and safety of the public from radiation hazards 
the nrc also has the authority to conduct environmental reviews pursuant to the national environmental policy act 
texas regulatory matters the rates and services of the company are regulated in texas by municipalities and by the texas commission 
the largest municipality in the company s service area is the city of el paso 
the texas commission has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review municipal orders and ordinances regarding rates and services within municipalities in texas and original jurisdiction over certain other activities of the company 
the decisions of the texas commission are subject to judicial review 
deregulation 
the texas restructuring law required certain investor owned electric utilities to separate power generation activities from transmission and distribution activities by january   and on that date  retail competition for generation services was instituted in some parts of texas 
the texas restructuring law  however  specifically recognized and preserved the company s texas rate stipulation and texas settlement agreement by  among other things  exempting the company s texas service area from retail competition until the end of the freeze period 
on october   the texas commission approved a rule further delaying retail competition in the company s texas service territory 
the rule approved by the texas commission sets a schedule which identifies various milestones for the company to reach before competition can begin 
the first milestone calls for the development  approval by the ferc  and commencement of independent operation of a rto  including the development of retail market protocols to facilitate retail competition 
the complete transition to retail competition would occur upon the completion of the last milestone which would be the texas commission s final evaluation of the market s readiness to offer fair competition and reliable service to all retail customers 
the company believes that adoption of this rule will likely delay retail competition in el paso for at least several years 
there is substantial uncertainty about both the regulatory framework and market conditions that will exist if and when retail competition is implemented in the company s service territory  and the company may incur substantial preparatory  restructuring and other costs that may not ultimately be recoverable 
there can be no assurance that deregulation would not adversely affect the future operations  cash flows and financial condition of the company

index to financial statements renewables and energy efficiency programs 
notwithstanding the commission s approval of a rule further delaying competition in the company s texas service territory  the company will become subject to the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements of the texas restructuring law on january  under the renewable energy requirements  the company will have to annually obtain its pro rata share of renewable energy credits as determined by the texas commission  based on total texas retail sales subject to renewable energy credit allocation 
the company s ultimate obligation to obtain renewable energy credits will not be known until january of the year following the compliance year  and it will have until march to obtain  if necessary  and submit to the texas commission  sufficient credits 
in addition  by january  and january   the company will be required to fund incentives for energy efficiency savings that will achieve the goal of meeting and of its growth in demand through energy efficiency savings  respectively 
preparatory costs incurred by the company to meet these requirements will not be recoverable in the company s texas service territory prior to the expiration of the freeze period 
termination of freeze period 
the freeze period expires on august  thereafter  the company will be subject to traditional cost of service regulation by the texas cities it serves and by the texas commission 
its present rates will stay in effect until changed by a city or the texas commission 
any such change would be initiated with either a request by the company or a complaint by a regulator or customer 
any rate change order would be preceded by discovery and presentation of evidence 
any decision by a city would be subject to appellate review by the texas commission 
the company has no present intention to request a base rate change  and no complaints against the company s base rates are pending 
the end of the freeze period may also bring an end to the sharing of off system sales margins between the company and its customers 
the current fuel rule in texas provides that such margins are to be fully credited to customers 
the company s ten year franchise with the city of el paso city expires on august  the franchise governs the company s usage of city owned property  including the payment of franchise fees 
the company is meeting with the city to discuss the company s franchise and rate treatment after the expiration of the freeze period 
the company is unable to predict the outcome of these discussions 
fuel 
although the company s base rates are frozen in texas pursuant to texas commission rules and the texas rate stipulation  the company can request adjustments to its fuel factor to more accurately reflect projected energy costs associated with providing electricity and seek recovery of past undercollections of fuel revenues  subject to periodic final review by the texas commission in fuel reconciliation proceedings 
the company reconciled its texas jurisdictional fuel costs for the period january  through december  in puc docket no 
 and on may   the texas commission issued its final order 
at issue was the company s request to recover an additional million  before interest  from its texas customers as a surcharge due to fuel undercollections from january through december the texas commission disallowed approximately million of texas jurisdictional 
table of contents 
index to financial statements expenses  before interest  consisting primarily of i approximately million of purchased power expenses which the texas commission characterized as imputed capacity charges  and ii approximately million in fees which were deemed to be administrative costs  not recoverable as fuel 
this disallowance was recorded as a reduction of fuel revenue during the fourth quarter of in texas  capacity charges are not eligible for recovery as fuel expenses but are to be recovered through the company s base rates 
as the company s base rates were frozen during the period in which the imputed capacity charges were deemed to have been incurred  the million of imputed capacity charges were therefore permanently disallowed  and not recoverable from its texas customers 
the texas commission s decision has been appealed by two parties and the company  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the appeals 
the company has incurred similar purchased power costs for the fuel reconciliation period beginning january  the company believes that it has accounted for its purchased power costs during the reconciliation period beginning january in a manner consistent with the texas commission s decision in puc docket no 
however  the texas commission recently commenced a generic rulemaking proceeding to determine a statewide policy for the appropriate pricing of capacity in purchased power contracts 
on august   the company filed an application puc docket no 
to reconcile texas jurisdictional fuel costs for the period january  to february  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the rulemaking and its potential impact on the company with respect to fuel recovery in future reconciliation periods  including those in puc docket no 
palo verde performance standards 
the texas commission established performance standards for the operation of palo verde pursuant to which each palo verde unit is evaluated annually to determine whether its three year rolling average capacity factor entitles the company to a reward or subjects it to a penalty 
the capacity factor is calculated as the ratio of actual generation to maximum possible generation 
if the capacity factor  as measured on a station wide basis for any consecutive month period  should fall below  the texas commission can also reconsider the rate treatment of palo verde  regardless of the provisions of the texas rate stipulation and the texas settlement agreement 
the removal of palo verde from rate base could have a significant negative impact on the company s revenues and financial condition 
under the performance standards as modified by the texas fuel settlement  the company has calculated the performance rewards for the reporting periods ending in  and to be approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these rewards will be included  along with energy costs incurred and revenues billed  as part of the texas commission s review during a future periodic fuel reconciliation proceeding as discussed above 
performance rewards are not recorded on the company s books until the texas commission has ordered a final determination in a fuel proceeding or comparable evidence of collectibility is obtained 
performance penalties are recorded when assessed as probable by the company

palo verde represents approximately of our available net generating capacity and represented approximately of our available energy for the twelve months ended december  nuclear fuel represented approximately of the total kwh energy mix of the company for the twelve months ended december  we face the risk of additional or unanticipated costs at palo verde resulting from i increases in operation and maintenance expenses  ii the replacement of steam generators in palo verde units and  iii an extended outage of any of the palo verde units  iv increases in estimates of decommissioning costs  v the storage of radioactive waste  including spent nuclear fuel  vi insolvency of other palo verde participants  and vii compliance with the various requirements and regulations governing commercial nuclear generating stations 
at the same time  the company s retail base rates in texas are effectively capped through a rate freeze ending in august as a result  the company cannot raise its base rates in texas prior to the expiration of the freeze period in the event of increases in non fuel costs or loss of revenue 
additionally  should retail competition occur  there may be competitive pressure on the company s power generation rates which could reduce its profitability 
the company cannot assure that its revenues will be sufficient to recover any increased costs  including any increased costs in connection with palo verde or other operations  whether as a result of inflation  changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements  or other causes 
our retail rates are subject to change following the termination of our ten year rate freeze in august our rates in texas  which account for of our revenues  have been frozen and not subject to regulatory review since august  the freeze period expires on august  thereafter  we will be subject to traditional cost of service regulation by the texas cities that we serve and the texas commission 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our texas rates after expiration of the freeze period 
in addition  the end of the freeze period may mean that we will no longer be entitled to retain of our margins from off system sales 
if a return to cost of service regulation leads to lower rates or the retention by us of less of the margin from off system sales  there would be a material negative impact on our revenues  earnings  cash flows and financial position

we may not be able to pass through all of our fuel expenses to customers in general  through regulation  we can pass through our fuel and purchased power expenses to our customers 
nevertheless  we agreed in to a fixed fuel factor for ten percent of our retail customers in new mexico 
this subjects us to the risk of increased costs of fuel that would not be recoverable 
the portion of fuel expense that is not fixed is subject to reconciliation by the texas and new mexico commissions 
prior to the completion of a reconciliation  the company records fuel transactions such that fuel revenues equal fuel expense except for the portion fixed in new mexico 
in the event that a disallowance occurs during a reconciliation proceeding  the amounts recorded for fuel and purchased power expenses could differ from the amounts allowed to be collected by us from our customers and we would incur a loss to the extent of the disallowance 
equipment failures and other external factors can adversely affect our results the generation and transmission of electricity require the use of expensive and complex equipment 
while we have a maintenance program in place  generating plants are subject to unplanned outages because of equipment failure 
we are particularly vulnerable to this due to the advanced age of several of our generating units in or near el paso 
in these events  we must acquire power from others at unpredictable costs in order to supply our customers and comply with our contractual agreements 
this can increase our costs materially and prevent us from selling excess power at wholesale  thus reducing our profits 
in addition  decisions or mistakes by other utilities may adversely affect our ability to use transmission lines to deliver or import power  thus subjecting us to unexpected expenses or to the cost and uncertainty of public policy initiatives 
we are particularly vulnerable to this because a significant portion of our available energy at palo verde and four corners is located hundreds of miles from el paso and las cruces and must be delivered to our customers over long distance transmission lines 
these factors  as well as weather  interest rates  economic conditions  fuel prices and price volatility  are largely beyond our control  but may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated earnings  cash flows and financial position 
competition and deregulation could result in a loss of customers and increased costs as a result of changes in federal law  our wholesale and large retail customers already have  in varying degrees  alternate sources of economical power  including co generation of electric power

there is substantial uncertainty about both the regulatory framework and market conditions that would exist if and when retail competition is implemented in the company s texas service territory  and we may incur substantial preparatory  restructuring and other costs that may not ultimately be recoverable

the company responded to tnp s complaint by contesting tnp s assertion of rollover rights on several grounds 
due to existing transmission constraints  a ferc ruling granting tnp s complaint could have adversely impacted the company s ability to import lower cost power from palo verde and four corners to serve its retail customers  which could have resulted in higher rates for the company s retail electric customers

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates note a to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies utilized by the company 
the preparation of these statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented and actual results could differ in future periods from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates  which are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and which require complex  subjective judgments  include the following sfas no 
collection of fuel expense value of net utility plant in service decommissioning costs and estimated asset retirement obligation future pension and other postretirement obligations reserves for tax dispute sfas no 
regulated electric utilities typically prepare their financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
under this accounting standard  certain recoverable costs are shown as either assets or liabilities on a utility s balance sheet if the regulator provides assurance that these costs will be charged to and collected from its customers or has already permitted such cost recovery 
the resulting regulatory assets or liabilities are amortized in subsequent periods based upon their respective amortization periods in a utility s cost of service 
beginning in  the company discontinued the application of sfas no 
to its financial statements 
this decision was based on the company s determination that its rates were no longer designed to recover its costs of providing service to customers 
upon emerging from bankruptcy in  the company again concluded that it did not meet the criteria for applying sfas no 
because of the ten year rate freeze in texas and its ongoing intention not to seek changes in its new mexico rates  which had been established in although the company believes the rates established in were based upon its costs of service  the unusual length of the rate freeze period created substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate recovery of its costs over the entire freeze period 
consequently  the company determined that it should not re apply sfas no 
to its texas jurisdiction at the time it emerged from bankruptcy in february as the freeze period draws to a close  the company will continue to evaluate whether it meets the criteria for the re application of sfas no 
to its texas jurisdiction 

table of contents 
index to financial statements during  the company determined that it met the criteria necessary to re apply sfas no 
to its new mexico jurisdictional operations 
for the new mexico jurisdiction  two key events transpired that  when considered together  resulted in the company s decision to re apply sfas no 
in april of  the company received a final order approving a unanimous stipulation which established new base and fuel rates for its new mexico customers which were implemented june  the company s approved rates were based upon its cost of providing service in new mexico 
that event  coupled with the repeal of new mexico s electric utility industry restructuring law which occurred in april of  resulted in the company meeting the criteria for the re application of sfas no 
to new mexico  beginning july  the re application of sfas no 
to the company s new mexico jurisdiction resulted in the recording of million of regulatory assets  million in related accumulated deferred income tax assets  million of regulatory liabilities  million in related accumulated deferred tax liabilities and a million extraordinary gain  net of tax  or basic and diluted earnings per share 
the company s continued ability to meet the criteria for the application of sfas no 
for the new mexico jurisdiction may be affected in the future by competitive forces and restructuring in the electric utility industry 
in the event that sfas no 
no longer applies to the new mexico jurisdiction  the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism is provided 
collection of fuel expense in general  through regulation  the company s fuel and purchased power expenses are passed through to its customers 
these costs are subject to reconciliation by the texas and new mexico commissions 
prior to the completion of a reconciliation  the company records fuel transactions such that fuel revenues equal fuel expense except for the portion fixed in new mexico 
in the event that a disallowance occurs during a reconciliation proceeding  the amounts recorded for fuel and purchased power expenses could differ from the amounts allowed to be collected by the company from its customers and the company could incur a loss to the extent of the disallowance 
value of net utility plant in service in  when it emerged from bankruptcy  the company recast its financial statements by applying fresh start reporting in accordance with statement of position financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
in this process  the company attributed value to its integrated utility system  including its generation assets  after it had established the value of its pro forma capital structure based on management s estimates of future operating results 
the company valued its generation assets such that the depreciated value of its generation assets would be approximately equal to their estimated fair value at the end of the freeze period 
this is important because at the beginning of retail competition in texas  the company will no longer be permitted to recover in rates any stranded costs  that is  the difference between the book value and the market value of its electric generation assets 
if at any time the company determines that estimated  undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations of the generation assets are not sufficient to recover their net book value  then it will be required to write down the value of these assets to their fair values 
any such writedown would be charged to earnings 
the company currently believes that its rates are sufficient to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements collect before the expiration of the freeze period substantially all costs that would otherwise be stranded under relevant laws in texas and that future net cash flows after the expiration of the freeze period from the generating assets will be sufficient to recover their net book values 
decommissioning costs and estimated asset retirement obligation pursuant to the anpp participation agreement and federal law  the company must fund its share of the estimated costs to decommission palo verde units  and and associated common areas 
the company recorded a liability and a corresponding asset for the fair value of its decommissioning obligation aro upon implementation of sfas no 
the company will adjust the liability to its present value periodically over time  and the corresponding asset will be depreciated over its useful life 
the determination of the estimated liability requires the use of various assumptions pertaining to decommissioning costs  escalation and discount rates 
the company and other palo verde participants rely upon decommissioning cost studies and make discount rate  rate of return and inflation projections to determine funding requirements and estimate liabilities related to decommissioning 
every third year  outside engineers perform a study to estimate decommissioning costs associated with palo verde units  and and associated common areas 
the company determines how it will fund its share of those estimated costs by making assumptions about future investment returns and future decommissioning cost escalations 
the funds are invested in professionally managed investment trust accounts 
the company is required to establish a minimum accumulation and a minimum funding level in its decommissioning trust accounts at the end of each annual reporting period in accordance with the anpp participation agreement 
if actual decommissioning costs exceed estimates  the company would incur additional costs related to decommissioning 
further  if the rates of return earned by the trusts fail to meet expectations  the company will be required to increase its funding to the decommissioning trust accounts 
although the company cannot predict the results of future studies  the company believes that the liability it has recorded for its decommissioning costs will be adequate to provide for the company s share of the costs  assuming that palo verde units  and operate over their remaining lives which includes an assessment of the probability of a license extension and that the doe assumes responsibility for permanent disposal of spent fuel at plant shut down 
the company believes that its current annual funding levels of the decommissioning trust will adequately provide for the cash requirements associated with decommissioning 
historically  regulated utilities such as the company have been permitted to collect in rates the costs of nuclear decommissioning 
should the company become subject to the texas restructuring law  the company expects to continue to be able to collect from customers the costs of decommissioning 
future pension and other postretirement obligations the company s obligations to retirees under various benefit plans are recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
this liability is calculated on the basis of significant assumptions regarding discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and health care cost inflation 
these assumptions as well as a sensitivity analysis of the effect of hypothetical changes in certain assumptions are set forth in detail in note k employee benefits to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on both net income and on the amount of liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in developing the assumptions  management makes judgments based on the advice of financial and actuarial advisors and its review of third party and market based data 
these sources include life expectancy tables  surveys of compensation and health care cost trends  and historical and expected return data on various categories of plan assets 
the assumed discount rate applied to future plan obligations is based at each measuring date on prevailing market interest rates inherent in high quality aa and better corporate bonds that would provide future cash flow needed to pay the benefits as they become due  as well as on publicly available bond issues 
the company regularly reviews its assumptions and conducts a reassessment at least once a year 
the company does not expect that any such change in assumptions will have a material effect on net income for reserves for tax dispute the company received final approval from the irs during the third quarter of to settle all issues relative to its through federal income tax returns 
as part of the settlement  the company was required to capitalize for tax purposes approximately twenty percent of the previously claimed lease rejection damage deductions 
in addition  the irs conceded the litigation settlement issue related to a terminated merger agreement 
as a result of the irs settlement  the company reduced its estimated contingent tax liability by million related to the resolution of certain tax contingency items and adjusted its state deferred tax liabilities net of federal tax benefit by million 
the irs settlement reduced income tax expense by approximately million during  which increased net income for such period by the same amount 
the irs is currently performing an examination of the through income tax returns 
the company has established  and periodically reviews and re evaluates  an estimated contingent tax liability on its consolidated balance sheet to provide for the possibility of adverse outcomes in tax proceedings 
although the ultimate outcome of the ongoing examination cannot be predicted with certainty  and while the contingent tax liability may not in fact be sufficient  the company believes that the amount of contingent tax liability recorded as of december  is a reasonable estimate of any additional tax that may be due
