item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview lufkin industries is a global supplier of oil field  power transmission and trailer products 
through its oil field segment  the company manufactures and services artificial reciprocating rod lift equipment and related products  which are used to extract crude oil and other fluids from wells 
through its power transmission segment  the company manufactures and services high speed and low speed speed increasing and reducing gearboxes for industrial applications 
through its trailer segment  the company manufactures various highway trailers  including van  float and dump trailers 
while these markets are price competitive  technological and quality differences can provide product differentiation 
the company s strategy is to differentiate its products through additional value add capabilities examples of these capabilities are high quality engineering  customized designs  rapid manufacturing response to demand through plant capacity  inventory and vertical integration  superior quality and customer service  and an international network of service locations 
in addition  the company s strategy is to maintain a low debt to equity ratio in order to quickly take advantage of growth opportunities and pay dividends even during unfavorable business cycles 
in support of the above strategy  during the third quarter of  the company completed two strategic acquisitions that expanded its oil field segment

increased sales of new pumping units account for a majority of the balance of the increase of percentage points 
sales of new pumping units in the us and canada  and related service  increased from higher drilling and production activity associated with higher energy prices and from higher use of pumping units to pump water from gas fields 
in addition  sales of automation equipment continued to increase as it grows market share from new product offerings 
commercial casting sales from the foundry operation grew significantly from the prior year as general economic levels in the us improved  especially in the machine tool market 
oil field s backlog increased to million as of december   from million at december  this backlog increase was from increased bookings of new pumping units in the us and argentina markets and from foundry machine tool casting orders 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the oil field segment decreased to for year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   or percentage points 
this decline was caused by higher raw material prices  especially steel and raw scrap iron  and the related lifo reserve impact  higher fuel prices and legal costs in the service operations and plant inefficiencies in the foundry operation associated with rapid production ramp up for the volume increases  offsetting the benefit of higher plant utilization on fixed cost coverage in the pumping unit manufacturing operations 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for oil field increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the for year ended december  the additional expenses of lufkin argentina contributed percentage points of this increase  with the balance of the increase primarily associated with higher employee related expenses in support of higher sales volumes 
sales for the company s power transmission segment increased to million  or  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the benefit of the stronger euro on the sales of the french division contributed percentage points of this increase 
the net percentage points of increase was the result of increased sales from the gear repair expansion in the southeast u 
s and increased sales of new low speed units to the metal processing and mining industries  partially offset by lower sales of high speed units to the oil and gas development market from 
table of contents customer project delays and reduced orders for oil pipeline projects 
the company s power transmission backlog at december   increased to million from million at december  this backlog increase was from increased orders for high speed units for the power generation market  low speed units for the metal processing and mining industries and higher orders in the repair sector from the southeast u 
s expansion 
gross margin for the power transmission segment decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   or percentage points 
this decline was from lower margins on new units for the power generation market from price competition and production inefficiencies 
in addition  margins on longer lead time orders have been impacted by rapidly rising raw material pricing  and the related lifo reserve impact  not being reflected in the original selling price 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for power transmission increased to million  or  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the impact of the stronger euro on the french operation and higher employee related expenses in support of higher sales volumes were partially offset by lower third party commissions and bad debt expense 
trailer sales for the year ended december   increased to million  or  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from higher sales of all models of new trailers 
freight industry demand has continued to improve due to replacement trailer demand and from increases in freight volume levels

backlog for the trailer segment increased to million at december   compared to million at december  the backlog increase was primarily from orders for new van trailers for the reasons mentioned above 
trailer gross margin increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   or percentage points 
this increase was from the benefit of higher plant utilization on fixed cost coverage and from some improvements in pricing levels 
these gains were partially offset by the impact of higher raw material prices  especially steel  and the related lifo reserve impact 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for trailer increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily from employee related expenses and third party commissions in support of the sales volume growth and higher general liability insurance claims

the balance of the increase  percentage points  is accounted for by increased sales of new pumping units in the us from higher drilling and production activity associated with higher energy prices and increased sales of automation equipment from new product offerings 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in sales of new pumping units into canada from new drilling activity in canada focusing on shallow wells  which use other forms of artificial lift 
oil field s backlog increased to million as of december   from million at december  this backlog increase was primarily from a million benefit from the argentina acquisition  increased bookings of new pumping units in the us small independent market  increasing deep well drilling activity in canada and foundry machine tool orders from a general improvement in the us industrial markets 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the oil field segment increased to for year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   or percentage points

sales for the company s power transmission segment increased to million  or  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the benefit of the stronger euro on the sales of the french division contributed percentage points of this increase 
the additional percentage points of growth was the result of increased sales in the french operation  in euros  due to the addition of the high speed product line and increased sales in the us from new high speed units to the oil and gas markets and the gear repair expansion in the southeast us these gains were partially offset by a drop in sales in new low speed units to the rubber market due to capital spending restraints from poor market conditions in the tire industry 
the company s power transmission backlog at december   decreased to million from million at december  this backlog decline was from lower orders of new high speed units in the oil and gas market due to short term project delays and price competition and lower orders in the power generation market from limited capital expansion activity 
gross margin for the power transmission segment decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   or percentage points 
this decline was due to lower margins on new high speed units in the us from several large project orders comprising multiple units  which are typically more competitive and price sensitive and the percentage point impact of reduced pension income and severance expenses

trailer sales for the year ended december   increased to million  or  from million for the year ended december  this growth was negatively impacted by percentage points from the change of strategy  implemented in the second quarter of  of its branch locations to focus primarily on parts sales instead of parts and service 
the percentage point increase in other trailer sales was primarily from increased sales of new vans as higher us freight tonnage has led to more orders from freight haulers and increased sales of floats due to the introduction of a new model 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of dump trailers as orders from the construction market have been weak 
backlog for the trailer segment totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the backlog increase was primarily from floats due to the growth in demand for the new model 
trailer gross margin declined to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   or percentage points 
this margin decline was due to continued pricing pressure on all models of trailers in the depressed freight hauling market and the percentage point impact of reduced pension income and severance expenses 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for trailer increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   due to an increase in general liability insurance claims 
while insurance claim filings cannot be accurately forecasted  this increase is not expected to recur on an ongoing and regular basis

sfas r is as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas r on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
as noted in the company s significant accounting policies  the company does not record compensation expense for stock based compensation 
note to the consolidated financial statements illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share had the company applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated statements 
the company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been established to provide for estimated losses on receivable collections 
the balance of this allowance is determined by regular reviews of outstanding receivables and historical experience 
as the financial condition of customers change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 

table of contents revenue is not recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
the criteria to meet this guideline are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in some cases  a customer is not able to take delivery of a completed product and requests that the company store the product for defined period of time 
the company will process a bill and hold invoice and recognize revenue at the time of the storage request if all of the following criteria are met the customer has accepted title and risk of loss 
the customer has provided a written purchase order for the product 
the customer  not the company  requested the product to be stored and to be invoiced under a bill and hold arrangement 
the customer must also provide the business purpose for the storage request 
the customer must provide a storage period and future shipping date 
the company must not have retained any future performance obligations on the product 
the company must segregate the stored product and not make it available to use on other orders 
the product must be complete and ready for shipment 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers 
on a routine basis  the company uses estimates in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by market activity levels  production requirements  the physical condition of products and technological innovation 
changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
also  the company accounts for a significant portion of its inventory under the lifo method 
the lifo reserve can be impacted by changes in the lifo layers and by inflation index adjustments 
long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value can be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows  based on expected future operating results 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value and thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill acquired in connection with business combinations represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the company performs impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than fair value  such as significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company s fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flows  which requires management to make judgments about future operating results  working capital requirements and capital spending levels 
changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors which negatively impact the fair value of the operations would influence the evaluation and may result in a determination that goodwill is impaired and a corresponding impairment charge 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws as well as changes in the financial position of the company could also affect the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
if management estimates that some or all of any deferred tax assets will expire before realization or that the future deductibility is not probable  a valuation allowance would be recorded 
the company is subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its businesses and operations 
the company retains a portion of the insured losses that occur through the use of deductibles 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported insured and non insured claims and legal actions and provides for losses through reserves 
as circumstances develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
the company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides repairs at no cost to the customer or the issuance of credit to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product being sold  but ranges from one year to five years 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales multiplied by prior sales still under warranty at the end of any period 
management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or other information becomes available 

table of contents the company offers a defined benefit plan and other benefits upon the retirement of its employees 
assets and liabilities associated with these benefits are calculated by third party actuaries under the rules provided by various accounting standards  with certain estimates provided by management 
these estimates include the discount rate  expected rate of return of assets and the rate of increase of compensation and health claims 
on a regular basis  management reviews these estimates by comparing them to actual experience and those used by other companies 
if a change in an estimate is made  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities may have to be adjusted 
differences in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets within reasonably likely ranges would have had the following estimated impact on results thousands of dollars 
percentage point increase 
percentage point decrease effect of change in discount rate on net periodic benefit cost income effect of change in long term rate of return on plan assets on net periodic benefit cost income forward looking statements and assumptions this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements and information  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  that are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in this report  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect the company s current views with respect to certain events and are subject to certain assumptions  risks and uncertainties  many of which are outside the control of the company 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  i oil prices  ii capital spending levels of oil producers  iii availability and prices for raw materials  iv currency exchange rate fluctuations in the markets in which the company operates  v changes in the laws  regulations  policies or other activities of governments  agencies and similar organizations where such actions may affect the production  licensing  distribution or sale of the company s products  the cost thereof or applicable tax rates  vi costs related to legal and administrative proceedings  including adverse judgments against the company if the company fails to prevail in reversing such judgments and vii general industry  political and economic conditions in the markets where the company s procures material  components and supplies for the production of the company s principal products or where the company s products are produced  distributed or sold 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  believed  estimated or expected 
the company undertakes no obligations to update or revise its forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  invested funds and debt obligations 
the book value of accounts receivable  short term debt and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their fair market value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
the company believes the carrying values of its long term debt obligations approximate fair values because the interest rates on these obligations are comparable to what the company believes it could currently obtain for debt with similar terms and maturities 
the company s accounts receivable are not concentrated in one customer or industry and are not viewed as an unusual credit risk 
the company does not utilize financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes or to hedge exposures to interest rates  foreign currency rates or commodity prices 
due to the low level of current debt exposure  the company does not have any significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
however  if the company drew on its line of credit under its bank facility  the company would have exposure since the interest rate is variable 
in addition  the company primarily invoices and purchases in the same currency as the functional currency of its operations  which minimizes exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
the company is exposed to currency fluctuations with debt denominated in us dollars owed to the company s us entity by its french and canadian entities 
as of december   this inter company debt was comprised of million euros and million canadian dollars 
as of december   if the us dollar strengthens by over these currencies  the net income impact would be million of expense and if the us dollar weakens by over these currencies  the net income impact would be million of income 
also  certain assets and liabilities  primarily employee and tax related  denominated in the local currency of foreign operations whose functional currency is the us dollar are exposed to fluctuations in currency rates
