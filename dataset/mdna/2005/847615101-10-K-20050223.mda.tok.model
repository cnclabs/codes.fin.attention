executive summary during fiscal  our net sales increased by million or from in addition to cbu product sales of million and sei product sales of million  our increased sales reflect additional shipment volume throughout all of our business segments and major product lines 
this volume increase was primarily driven by improved market conditions throughout the telecommunications equipment industry and increased demand for our military related products 
our gross margin also increased to of sales in  compared to of sales a year ago  reflecting improved operating efficiencies and economies of scale realized with additional production and shipment volumes 
as a result  our overall profitability improved with net income and earnings per share of million or cents per share in fiscal  compared to  or seven cents per share in fiscal despite increases in certain working capital requirements  our operating cash flow remains strong 
net cash generated by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended november  this positive cash flow reflects our profitable operating performance  as well as improved inventory turnover rates and related inventory reductions 
despite increased sales volume and production requirements  aggregate inventories decreased by  in fiscal year  excluding the impact of our acquired businesses 
this inventory reduction was achieved through numerous inventory control procedures  including material substitutions and reduced manufacturing cycle times 
our financial position and liquidity remain strong 
at november   our cash and cash equivalents were million  our current ratio was to  and our total debt to equity was to

in addition  our net sales include million of product sales for our acquired businesses of cbu and sei 
sales of signal integrity products amounted to million in  up million from the prior year 
these products are used in a wide variety of applications and industries including telecommunications  military  aerospace  medical and automotive 
power integrity product sales increased by million in  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal among other applications  these power products are incorporated into various telecom equipment including wireless base stations and telephone switching gear 
sales of power management systems were million in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal these advanced systems include power distribution units  fuse and breaker interface panels  and remote monitoring systems used in wireless base stations and other telecommunication infrastructure equipment 
in addition to cbu and sei aggregate product sales of million  frequency control product sales grew by million in fiscal overall  average selling prices remained relatively stable throughout all of our product lines 
total customer orders received in amounted to million  an increase of million or from the preceding year 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross margin gross margin in fiscal was million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the improvement in gross margin percentage principally reflects decreases in manufacturing overhead costs  from consolidation and cost reduction programs  and economies of scale realized with additional production and shipment volumes 
total manufacturing overhead costs were million or of sales in fiscal  versus million or of sales in the preceding year 
as a percentage of sales  material and labor costs remained reasonably stable throughout the period with aggregate material and labor costs amounting to million or of sales in and million or of sales in at november   we had a total workforce of  employees  including cbu personnel of and sei personnel of at november   we had employees 
we expect to continuously review our organization and cost structure to further improve operating efficiencies  while maintaining flexibility for future capacity expansion 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal  selling expense amounted to million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in selling expense  as a percentage of sales  primarily reflects the impact of higher sales volume and certain fixed selling expenses 
in addition  effective sales commission rates decreased slightly in general and administrative expense was million in and million in the million increase in general and administrative expense principally reflects higher personnel costs  additional expenditures for legal and professional services  and other operating expenses related to increased business levels 
other income and expense interest expense was  in fiscal and  in fiscal  reflecting current year reductions in bank indebtedness 
we hold numerous united states and foreign patents relating to polymer multilayer pml technology 
we realized license fee income of  in and  in upon the granting of pml technology licenses 
although these licenses  as well as other pml licenses that we have previously granted  require certain royalties to be paid to us upon the sale of products utilizing pml technology  it is not known what future commercial value  if any  these patents and related licenses may have 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries transact business with certain customers and vendors in currencies other than their local currency 
as a result  we recognize gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses  however  were not material in any of the periods presented herein 
we realized interest income of  in and  in from temporary cash investments 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate primarily arise from state tax provisions and foreign income tax rates 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at november   we had recorded certain deferred tax assets  including aggregate state net operating loss carryforwards of  expiring at varying amounts through in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon our level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income  we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded at november  compared to net sales consolidated net sales increased by million or from in addition to fsy product sales  this increase reflects greater shipment volume for substantially all of our signal and power integrity product lines 
sales of signal integrity products amounted to million in  up million from the preceding year 
power integrity product sales increased by million in  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal these sales increases primarily reflect improved overall market conditions within the telecommunications equipment industry and increased demand for our military related products 
sales of power management systems were constant throughout the period at million in and sales of frequency control products totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal fsy product sales generated million of this million increase in frequency control product sales  with the remaining increase reflecting additional shipment volume of ceramic resonators  bandpass filters and patch antennas 
average selling prices remained relatively stable throughout all of our product lines 
total customer orders received in amounted to million  an increase of million or from the preceding year 
gross margin gross margin in fiscal was million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the gross margin in was significantly below historical levels  primarily reflecting lower than anticipated sales volume and manufacturing inefficiencies caused by an abrupt downturn in product demand by our telecommunications equipment customers 
throughout fiscal  we identified and implemented numerous cost reduction programs to better align our operations with current business expectations 
these cost reduction programs included consolidating certain of our pennsylvania manufacturing facilities to decrease manufacturing overhead  transferring the production of most of our commercial products to our low cost manufacturing center in juarez  mexico to reduce labor costs  and generating greater utilization of our metal fabrication operations in wesson  mississippi to lower material costs 
as a result of these efforts  and economies of scale realized with higher shipment levels  gross margin in fiscal year improved significantly 
at november   we had a total workforce of employees  approximately the same as the end of the preceding fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal  selling expense amounted to million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in selling expense  as a percentage of sales  principally reflects the impact of higher sales volume and certain fixed selling expenses 
in addition  effective sales commission rates decreased in general and administrative expense was approximately million in and million in the increase in general and administrative expense primarily reflects additional personnel costs  including performance based compensation 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other income and expense interest expense was relatively constant during the period  amounting to  in fiscal and  in fiscal in  other income consists of interest income from short term investments of  pml license fee income of  and net gains on foreign currency transactions of  in  other income reflects  of pml license fee income   of interest income  and  of net foreign currency transaction losses 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate arise from state tax provisions and foreign income tax rates 
risk factors that may affect future results in fiscal year  approximately of our sales were to customers in the telecommunications industry 
our three largest telecom customers  original equipment manufacturers of telecommunications equipment  represented of our total consolidated net sales in throughout most of the last four years  the telecommunications equipment industry has experienced a severe slowdown and extreme volatility 
recently  market conditions in the industry have demonstrated improvement  but overall market trends and forecasts remain unpredictable 
if the current market conditions deteriorate  it will have a material negative impact on our future operating performance 
in addition  our results of operations may be negatively affected in the future by a variety of other factors including competitive pricing pressures  new technologies which decrease the demand for our products  new product offerings by our competitors  product cost changes  changes in the overall economic climate  cancellation of existing customer order backlog  unanticipated impairment of assets  difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and product lines  changes in the availability of raw materials  and changes in product mix 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition we maintain a million line of credit with our principal lending institution  pnc bank  na of erie  pennsylvania the bank  with borrowings secured by accounts receivable  and with interest rates on borrowings at or below the prevailing prime rate 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit 
the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain designated minimum levels of net worth and profitability and impose certain restrictions on us regarding additional indebtedness 
at november   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
our ability to borrow in the future under this credit facility is dependent on our ongoing compliance with the restrictive covenants 
whether we continue to comply with these covenants is largely dependent on our ability to attain certain levels of operating performance and profitability in the future  for which there can be no assurance 
the current line of credit agreement expires on april   and is expected to be renewed under similar terms 
our wholly owned german subsidiary maintains an unsecured euro line of credit with a german financial institution aggregating approximately million euro million 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
future borrowings  if any  will bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate and will be payable upon demand 
at november   we had net working capital of million  compared to million at november  and million at november  our current ratio remains very strong with current assets times current liabilities at november   compared to at november  and at november  in  the reduction in our current ratio reflects the impact of acquiring businesses and their related long lived assets by utilizing some of our existing cash reserves 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued excluding the assets of our acquired businesses  our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to million in fiscal year these capital expenditures were primarily for routine replacement of fixed assets  as well as manufacturing equipment and tooling for our china manufacturing operations 
at november   we had not entered into any material commitments for capital expenditures 
in response to uncertain overall market conditions  and as part of our related cost containment programs  we controlled our capital expenditures in and to minimum required amounts 
total capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were  in and  in these capital expenditures were primarily for manufacturing equipment and tooling to enhance efficiencies  particularly in our ceramic capacitor operations and our power management systems product offerings 
in  as part of our efforts to consolidate manufacturing facilities and dispose of excess property and equipment  we sold certain land  building and equipment located in elizabethtown and erie  pennsylvania 
manufacturing previously conducted at these sites has been transferred and successfully integrated into our other production facilities 
net proceeds realized from the sale of these assets was approximately million 
we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of sei in february  in october   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of cbu 
the total net cash purchase price for these acquired businesses was million  which was entirely funded through available cash reserves 
in addition to the net cash purchase price for cbu  future contingent payments may also be incurred 
the amount of contingent payments will be determined based upon the total customer orders received for cbu products during the fourth calendar quarter of and the first calendar quarter of if the aggregate customer orders received in either quarter exceeds million the target  a contingent payment is earned by the seller equal to of the amount by which the actual customer orders received in the quarter exceeds the target 
for the fourth calendar quarter of  we estimate that a contingent payment of approximately  will be earned 
contingent payments earned will be paid in cash within days following the close of the applicable quarter 
we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of fsy in july  the net cash purchase price for fsy was million  excluding possible future contingent payments 
this net cash purchase price was entirely funded through available cash reserves 
the amount of contingent payments are determined based upon the increase in sales of the acquired product lines during the three years subsequent to the acquisition date 
for the first two years subsequent to the acquisition date  no contingent payments were earned or paid 
during the third year  contingent payments will be earned if fsy s annual product sales for the year exceed million 
the contingent payment amount will be equal to of such sales in excess of million 
contingent payments earned  if any  will be paid in cash within days following the close of the applicable period of calculation 
we have adopted a stock repurchase program 
under this program  we may repurchase up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
acquired shares are to be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices 
funding for these repurchases is expected to come from available cash reserves and borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility 
the amount and timing of the shares repurchased are based on our ongoing assessment of the company s capital structure  liquidity  and the market price of the company s common stock 
the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock 
during fiscal  no shares were repurchased 
repurchases totaled  shares in fiscal and  shares in fiscal at an aggregate cost of  and million  respectively 
since the inception of the stock repurchase program   shares have been repurchased at a total cost of million 
research and development expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products and processes  amounted to million in  and million in and we expect to continue our investment in research and development in  as we continuously enhance existing product lines  design new signal and power integrity products  further develop our frequency control and power management systems product offerings  and increase our participation in emerging markets such as automotive 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes paid during the fiscal years ended november   and amounted to million   and  respectively 
as a result of certain state operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets  we expect cash outlays for income taxes to be significantly less than income tax expense for fiscal year as of november   our obligations and firm commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases current financial resources  including working capital and existing lines of credit  and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet operating cash requirements throughout fiscal year  including scheduled long term debt repayment  lease commitments  planned capital equipment expenditures  research and development expenses  possible stock repurchases  and contingent payments under acquisition agreements 
there can be no assurance  however  that unplanned capital replacement or other future events will not require us to seek additional debt or equity financing and  if so required  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
despite increases in certain working capital requirements  our operating cash flow remains strong 
net cash generated by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended november  this positive cash flow reflects our profitable operating performance  as well as improved inventory turnover rates and related inventory reductions 
despite increased sales volume and production requirements  aggregate inventories decreased by  in fiscal year  excluding the impact of our acquired businesses 
this inventory reduction was achieved through numerous inventory control procedures  including material substitutions and reduced manufacturing cycle times 
net cash generated by operating activities amounted to million in  compared to million in with greater sales volume in  accounts receivable increased by million 
operating cash flow in fiscal reflects the refund of million of federal income taxes from prior year net operating loss carrybacks and overpayments 
in addition  as a result of improved turnover rates  accounts receivable and inventories decreased in by million and million  respectively 
at november   goodwill represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
in addition to a total of million of goodwill recognized in connection with our acquisitions of cbu  sei and fsy  a majority of our recorded goodwill was recognized in in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the signal conditioning products division of amp incorporated 
with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective december   we have performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined that no impairment loss need be recognized in the years ended november   and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency certain of our european sales and related selling expenses are denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  and other local currencies 
in addition  certain of our operating expenses are denominated in mexican pesos and chinese yuan 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect our operating results and cash flows 
to manage our exposure to the euro and british pound sterling  we occasionally enter into forward currency exchange contracts 
at november   we did not have any forward currency exchange contracts outstanding 
for each of the three years ended november   currency exchange rate gains and losses were not material 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest rate exposure we have market risk exposure relating to possible fluctuations in interest rates 
from time to time  we utilize interest rate swap agreements to minimize the risks and costs associated with variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
at november   no interest rate swap agreements were outstanding 
environmental matters we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries 
us federal environmental legislation having particular impact on us includes the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act  and the safe drinking water act 
we also are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters 
the united states environmental protection agency epa  osha  and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations 
in addition to these federal agencies  various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes 
many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations  some of which are similar to federal requirements 
state and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of these laws and regulations 
as part of our continuing environmental program  we have been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on our business 
we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings involving environmental matters 
impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
however  we continuously monitor operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of precious metals used in our manufacturing of certain ceramic capacitors 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales price over time 
sales price increases  however  were not significant in any of the years presented herein 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value 
for most public entities  the provisions of sfas no 
r will be effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  sfas no 
r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
effective for our fourth quarter of fiscal  we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r using a modified version of prospective application 
under this transition method  compensation cost will be recognized on or after the effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards previously calculated under sfas no 
for pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  we expect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by sfas no 
we currently expect the adoption of sfas no 
r will have an effect on our results of operations similar to the amounts reported historically in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements under the pro forma disclosure provisions of sfas no 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

the statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
also requires disclosures about alternative ways of settling financial instruments and the capital structure of entities whose shares are mandatorily redeemable 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for hedging activities and derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
the statement clarifies the circumstances in which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component  and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
the company s adoption of these recent accounting pronouncements fin  sfas no 
 and sfas no 
did not have any impact on the company s results of operations or financial position as presented herein 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and carrying amounts of accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets  and deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including an assessment of the customer s financial condition and the length of time a receivable is past due 
at november   our allowance for doubtful accounts was  or approximately of our aggregate accounts receivable 
in determining the adequacy of this allowance  we have assumed that market conditions in the telecommunications equipment industry will continue to improve throughout fiscal if this improvement does not occur  or if market conditions deteriorate further  our customers may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us 
accordingly  our estimate of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
at november   we had recorded inventory reserves in the aggregate amount of million for excess and slow moving items 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we considered numerous factors including current customer forecasts and estimated usage 
should these forecasts and estimates change due to market  technological or other factors  the net realizable value of our inventories may be materially less than our current carrying values 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we review goodwill for possible impairment at least annually 
impairment losses are recognized when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is contingent upon many factors  including estimates of future discounted operating cash flows 
long lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of possible impairment exist 
impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows derived from such assets are less than their carrying values 
no impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods presented herein 
however  our future cash flow expectations assume that market conditions throughout the telecommunications equipment industry will continue to improve 
if long term market conditions do not improve  our long lived assets may become materially impaired 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset may not be realized 
presently  we believe that all deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized and a valuation allowance is not required 
we evaluate the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and make adjustments as needed 
these adjustments  when made  may have a materially negative impact on our financial statements
