overview we design  manufacture and sell next generation broadband access communications equipment to wireline and wireless communications carriers 
we were incorporated in september as a successor company to koenig communications  inc  equipment systems integration and consulting company that had been in operation since in the summer of  we ceased our systems integration and consulting business and commenced our main product sales with the commercial deployment of our first network access products  which was followed 
table of contents by the introduction of our wide bank products in november  access navigator products in january  adit products in december  the broadmore products in october  which we acquired from litton network access systems  inc  or lnas  and the axxius products in june in november we acquired the master series and broadway product lines through our acquisition of paragon networks international  inc during the late s  a substantial number of carriers  including clecs  invested heavily in network infrastructure and service delivery projects  which accelerated growth in the telecommunications equipment market 
by  when our annual net revenues reached million  we relied on a limited number of clecs for a significant portion of our net revenue 
however  starting in late  many of these clecs encountered sharp declines in the amount of capital they had available to fund network infrastructure and service delivery projects 
as a result  there was a significant decline in the demand for telecommunications equipment  including demand for our products 
we have since broadened our product portfolio into new markets  including wireless carriers and incumbent wireline carriers 
for example  in  of our net revenue was derived from clecs  from ilecs  and from wireless carriers compared to  and  respectively  in currently  the wireless and ilec markets are dominated by a small number of large companies  and we continue to rely upon a small number of customers in these markets for a significant portion of our revenue 
for the year ended december   direct sales to two customers each accounted for over of our revenue ericsson accounted for and tmobile accounted for 
when the downturn in the telecommunications industry adversely affected our net revenue and operating results in late  we reduced our operating expenses in an effort to better position our business for the long term 
in december  we completed a restructuring plan designed to reduce our expenses and align our workforce and operations to be more in line with anticipated net revenues 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we recorded a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of this charge was comprised of million for future rent payments related to facility closures and downsizing and  for salary related expenses due to reductions in our workforce 
our objective has been to focus on cost controls while continuing to invest in the development of new and enhanced products  which we believe will position us to take advantage of sales opportunities as economic conditions improve and demand recovers  a trend that we have started to see over the past year 
however  we believe current economic conditions may continue to cause our customers and potential customers to defer and reduce capital spending 
historically  most of the sales of our products have been through a limited number of distributors 
walker associates accounted for in  in and in recently  however  an increasing proportion of our products sales have been made directly to telecommunications carriers and oems 
for the year ended december   ericsson  an oem  accounted for of net revenue  and we sold directly to a carrier  tmobile  who accounted for over of our net revenue 
we expect that the sale of our products will continue to be made to a small number of distributors  oems  and direct customers 
as a result  the loss of  or reduction of sales to  any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our net revenue continues to be affected by the timing and number of orders for our products  which continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to factors such as demand for our products  economic conditions  and the financial stability and ordering patterns of our direct customers  distributors  and oems 
in addition  a significant portion of our net revenue has been derived from a limited number of large orders  and we believe that this trend will continue in the future  especially if the percentage of oem and direct sales to customers continues to increase since such customers typically place larger orders than our distributors 
the timing of such orders and our ability to fulfill them has caused material fluctuations in our operating results  and we anticipate that such fluctuations will continue in the future 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and to to to to variance in s variance in variance in s variance in in thousands  except percentages net revenue cost of goods sold the increase in net revenue in was primarily due to increases in the number of units sold into the wireless market 
we believe that the increase was due to the deployment of our axxius  adit  broadway and masterseries products to comply with fcc mandated e location services and to expand cell site bandwidth capacity for new data service offerings by wireless mobility carriers 
our net revenue also improved due to the continued economic recovery and lessening of capital market constraints in the telecommunications sector in compared to the increase in net revenue in was due to increases in the number of units sold into the wireless market 
we believe that the increase in units sold in was partially due to the deployment by some wireless carriers of our axxius  adit and masterseries products to comply with fcc mandated e location services and expand cell site bandwidth capacity 
the acquisition of paragon in november contributed to the increase in wireless market revenue  primarily because of our masterseries product 
our net revenue also improved due to a slight economic recovery and the lessening of capital market constraints in the telecommunications sector in a significant portion of our net revenue has been derived from a limited number of large orders  and we believe that this trend will continue in the future  especially if the percentage of direct sales to end users increases 
in  and  of our net revenue was derived from   and orders  respectively 
we have experienced a substantial decrease in the number of orders from some of these customers as a result of decreases in their capital spending budgets and the impact of adverse economic conditions both in general and in the telecommunications equipment industry in particular  which has resulted in decreased demand for telecommunications equipment during this period 
in order to maintain or grow our net revenue  as well as offset the loss of anticipated net revenue from some of our prior customers  we will need to sell more products to both our remaining customers and new customers  and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to make such sales 
our net revenue was and continues to be affected by the timing and quantities of orders for our products which may vary from quarter to quarter in the future  as they have in the past  due to factors such as demand for our products  economic conditions  bankruptcies of our customers and distributors  and ordering patterns of distributors  oems and other direct customers 
we believe that this trend could continue in the future  especially if the percentage of direct sales to end users increases 
the timing of customer orders and our ability to fulfill them can cause material fluctuations in our operating results  and we anticipate that such fluctuations will occur in the future 
to to to to variance in s variance in variance in s variance in in thousands  except percentages gross profit gross margin gross margin decreases in were attributable to changes in product mix  as gross margins vary among products  as well as decreases in our selling prices 
in addition  we finalized our integration with paragon  which resulted in disposing of inventory carried at  that reduced margins by 
our gross margin increases were also attributable to changes in product mix  as gross margins vary among products  product cost reductions and higher production volumes  and were partially offset by decreases in selling prices 
we believe that the average selling prices and the related gross margins will decline for mature products as volume price discounts in distributor contracts and direct sales relationships take effect due to competition 
we 
table of contents have seen the average selling price for the wide bank products  adit products  and masterseries products decrease during in addition  new product introductions could harm gross margins until production volume increases 
to to to to variance in s variance in variance in s variance in in thousands  except percentages research and development the increases in research and development expenses in compared to were primarily related to an increase in personnel expense of million and approximately million of prototype expenses to support the development and release of our converged ip voice data network  and compression solutions 
related to these programs  we increased our spending by  for software consultants   for pilots  and  for compliance program testing 
research and development expenses for decreased from mostly due to a million decrease in personnel expense due to reductions in work force 
there were also decreases of million for depreciation expense  million in expense for technical certification programs and million decrease in prototyping expenses 
depreciation decreased as we took assets out of service in late and telcordia certification decreased due to a one time expense in related to our wide bank product platforms 
to to to to variance in s variance in variance in s variance in in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing general and administrative goodwill and intangible asset amortization asset impairment charges   n a restructuring   n a settlement expenses   n a bad debt expense recovery sales and marketing expenses for increased as a result of a million increase in personnel expense  and a  increase in travel and related expenses in response to new products obtained from the integration of paragon operations and efforts to focus on the enterprise market 
in addition  we recorded approximately  of interest and penalties incurred on payroll taxes during for a preacquisition contingency related to our acquisition of paragon in this amount was related to certain foreign sales and marketing activities 
in addition  approximately  was reclassified from income tax expense to operating expense 
given the timing of the resolution  the amount recorded for interest and penalties  was not reflected in our earnings release issued on january  for the quarter ended december   however the non cash adjustment did not impact our earnings per share calculation 
general and administrative expense for increased primarily due to a  increase in personnel expense and approximately  related to sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts 
these expenses were offset by approximately  due to the net cost savings obtained from purchasing the pearl parkway headquarters in boulder colorado at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
settlement expenses increased in as a result of the settlement amount and legal expenses associated with the smtc lawsuit 

table of contents bad debt expense recoveries in were  and million in in and  we were able to recover substantially all of the delinquent receivables and part of the accounts receivable related to bankruptcy of our customers 
selling  general and administrative expense for decreased from sales and marketing expense for decreased primarily as a result of a million decrease in personnel expense  a  decrease in travel and entertainment expense  a  decrease in expenses for demonstration equipment and a  decrease in communication expense 
most of the decreases in sales and marketing expenses were the result of the reduction in sales and marketing personnel that occurred in the early part of and the expenses related to their sales and marketing activities 
general and administrative expense decreased in from the decrease was primarily attributable to a million expense for legal and settlement costs incurred in as well as a million decrease in personnel cost and a  decrease in professional fees 
bad debt expense went from a million expense in to a million recovery in in  a number of our customers filed for bankruptcy and one of our distributors was experiencing financial difficulties which caused a significant amount of accounts receivables to become delinquent 
in  we were able to recover some of the delinquent receivables and part of the accounts receivable related to the bankruptcy 
we also incurred an asset impairment charge related to goodwill of million and a restructuring charge of million in to to to to variance in s variance in variance in s variance in in thousands  except percentages interest and other income  net income taxes benefit interest and other income  net for increased due to million of interest earned on increased cash and cash equivalent balances from our public stock offering that we completed in february  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
we also were released from an accrued liability as part of a bankruptcy settlement agreement that resulted in a net gain of million 
in addition  we recognized a gain of  related to the sale of company assets 
interest and other income  net for decreased to  from  in the decrease was due to lower interest income earned due to lower interest rates 
for  our effective combined federal and state income tax rate was a negative compared to an income tax rate of negative and for and  respectively 
in the second quarter of  we determined that  based on our taxable losses  projections of future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  realization of our deferred tax assets was not sufficiently assured 
as a result  we recorded a valuation allowance of million reducing the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets to zero 
we recorded an additional valuation allowance of million in the second half of to reduce the additional deferred tax assets generated during that period 
in  we recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately million  related primarily to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of paragon 
in  we recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately million related to additional deferred tax assets generated during the year 
despite some profitable periods in and  as of december   we cannot conclude the realization of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not given losses in recent quarters  history of volatility in our earnings  and insufficient certainty of forecasted earnings 
although we may be profitable in  we do not believe that we will experience any income tax expense in our net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset up to million of future taxable income for federal tax purposes 
the december  valuation allowance contains components relating to the paragon acquisition  stock option compensation and net operating loss carryforwards 
as these net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  we will reduce the related valuation allowance 
reductions in the valuation allowance  if any  will be recognized against goodwill for the portion related to the acquisition  against additional paid in capital for the portion relating to stock options and in our statements of operations as an income tax benefit  and may offset any current income tax expense 
in addition  should we demonstrate a history of sustained profitability  we may reverse all or a significant portion of the remaining valuation allowance 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources to to variance in s variance in in thousands  except percentages working capital cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities total assets to to to to variance in s variance in variance in s variance in in thousands  except percentages net cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities at december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of approximately million 
at december   our working capital was approximately million 
in february of  we completed a stock offering  which generated additional cash of approximately million 
cash used by operations was  for the year ended december  contrasted to million provided by operations in the change was primarily due to a decrease in net income of million and the receipt of our income tax refund of million in our lower net income in was impacted in part by increased non cash charges for depreciation and decreases in recoveries of doubtful accounts 
inventory and accounts payable were the primary uses of cash in cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we had net purchases of million of marketable securities compared to purchases of million for the year ended december  our capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million compared to  for the year ended december  during the year  we purchased our facility located at pearl parkway for approximately million 
we believe our current facilities are sufficient to meet our current operating requirements 
capital expenditures in are not expected to exceed those of net cash from financing activities provided million for the year ended december   which was the result of cash received from our stock offering of million and million received from the exercise of options  compared to million from the exercise of options for the year ended december  our net inventory levels increased approximately million to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily the result of product buildup in anticipation of the increase in product sales 
we believe that our existing cash and investment balances are adequate to fund our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period greater than months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent we experience growth in the future  we anticipate that our operating and investing activities may use cash 
we may consider using our capital to make strategic investments  acquisitions of companies  or to acquire or license technology or products 
however  we cannot assure you that additional funds or capital will be available to us in adequate amounts and with reasonably acceptable terms 

table of contents contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands payments due by period less more than than total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations total carrier access leases office space under various noncancelable operating leases that expire through carrier access records rent expense under noncancelable operating leases using the straight line method after consideration of increases in rental payments over the lease term  and records the difference between actual payments and rent expense as deferred rent concessions 
carrier access has placed non cancelable purchase orders for million of inventory from certain of its vendors for delivery in purchase orders are generally placed up to months in advance based on the lead time of the inventory 
rent expense for the years ended december    and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases discussed above 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue and product returns  inventory valuations  allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  deferred income taxes and warranty reserves 
we use historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances as a basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and other items that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting areas to have the most significant impact on the reported financial results and financial position of our company 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title using guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
our revenue from sales of products is recognized upon shipment based upon our shipping terms  provided that we have evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed and collectibility is probable 
we offer certain of our customers the right to return products for a limited time after shipment as part of a stock rotation program 
we estimate future stock rotation returns based upon actual historical return rates and reduce our revenue by these estimated returns 
if future returns exceed our estimates  revenue would be further reduced 
inventory reserves 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture or the current estimated net realizable value of inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon 
table of contents assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our estimates  then additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust open account status based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the age of outstanding invoices and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have usually been within our expectations and the provisions established  we did recover a significant portion of aged receivables in and that we had previously provided for 
this recovery amounted to approximately million 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
because our sales are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material impact on our ability to collect our accounts receivable and  accordingly  on our future operating results 
valuation of intangible assets 
we regularly evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in assessing whether the value of our goodwill and other intangibles has been impaired  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
at the time of an acquisition we estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired and amortize the cost over the estimated useful life 
deferred income taxes 
current income tax expense benefit represents actual or estimated amounts payable or receivable on tax return filings each year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheets  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period determines the deferred tax provision or benefit for the period 
effects of changes in enacted tax laws on deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected as adjustments to the tax provision or benefit in the period of enactment 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if management cannot conclude that realization of such assets is more likely than not at the balance sheet date 
based upon our recent history of losses and an analysis of projected net taxable income for future operating periods  we determined that realization of our tax net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets is not sufficiently assured 
based upon this analysis  a valuation allowance has been recorded as of december   to reduce the carrying amount of our million of net deferred tax assets to zero 
warranty reserves 
we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers depending on the specific product and the terms of our customer purchase agreements 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective product returned to us during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
on an on going basis  management reviews these estimates against actual expenses and makes adjustments when necessary 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we could not guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in products return rates or the costs to repair our products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of a loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
leases 
we currently lease some of our facilities  the terms of which contain provisions for rent increases 
we record the effects of those scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the lease term 

table of contents employee stock options 
as further explained in note n and note in notes to consolidated financial statements  stock options are granted to employees  consultants and directors 
upon vesting  an option becomes exercisable  that is  the option holder can purchase a share of company common stock at a price that is equal to the share price on the day of grant 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  permits companies either to continue accounting for stock options under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or to adopt a fair value based method to measure compensation cost 
we currently account for our stock based compensation plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of apb no 
and provide supplemental information in notes to consolidated financial statements as if we used the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
under sfas no 
 an option is valued on grant day  and then expensed evenly over its vesting period 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the option s fair value 
the option valuation model requires a number of assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected option life the amount of time until the options are exercised or expire 
expected option life is based on actual exercise activity from previous option grants 
volatility is calculated based upon stock price movements over the most recent period equal to the expected option life 
additionally our share price on grant day influences the option value 
the higher the share price  the more the option is worth 
changes in the option value after grant day are not reflected in expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and interest rates 
historically  and as of december   we have had little or no exposure to market risk in the area of changes in foreign currency or exchange rates 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
we have fixed income securities that are subject to interest rate risk 
the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize the risk 
securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk 
at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
given the current balance of million of investments classified as cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale  a theoretical change in interest rates and security prices would impact our net income positively or negatively by approximately million
