item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview our primary objectives for fiscal were to continue to drive down the operating costs and to position the company for a return of profitability 
our gross profit increased to million or of total revenues for twelve months ended march  compared to gross profit of million or of total revenues for same period last year 
the increase of the profit margin was primarily due to the development of the new product and better sales planning 
our fixed operating expenses compensation and selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal decrease to million from million  a decrease of million or compared to prior year 
the decrease of fixed operating expenses was primarily due to the aggressive cost reduction initiative implemented by the management team 
as a result  our net loss decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of the company s total revenues total revenues cost of sales operating expenses operating loss income other expenses  income  net loss income before taxes provision benefit for income taxes loss income fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to million compared to revenues of million in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in net sales was a result of both decreases in unit volume as well as pricing 
the decrease in sales is primarily attributed to o we made a decision not to pursue low margin accounts which tie up cash flow but do not provide enough profit margins  o customers concerned of our financial liquidity  o customers had high level of inventory on hand from prior year  o increase of competition in the united states and international market 
in fiscal year  of our sales were direct sales  which represent sales made by international smc  and were domestic sales  which represents sales made from our warehouse in the united states 
the sales decrease occurred in all segments of our business 
our total hardware sales decreased to million  in fiscal compared to total hardware sales of million in fiscal music sales decreased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in music sales was a result of increased competition in this category 
gross profit gross profit for fiscal was million or of total revenues compared to million or of sales for fiscal the increase in gross margin  compared to the prior year  was primarily due to the development of new products and better sales planning 
we developed seven new models in fiscal  which made up million in sales or of the hardware sales in fiscal our new products have differentiated us from our competitors and yield a higher profit margin 
our gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities  since some entities include the costs of warehousing  inspection  freight charges and other distribution costs in their cost of sales 
we account for the above expenses as operating expenses and classify them under selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses operating expenses for the fiscal year ended march  decreased from million to million  a decrease of million or compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in operating expenses consists of a decrease in variable expenses and fixed expenses 
the variable expenses advertising  commission  freight and royalty expenses were decreased proportionally as revenues decreased 
the fixed expense decrease of million was primarily due to the following factors o decreases in compensation expenses in the amount of million due to business downsizing and staff cuts 
o decreases in professional fees and legal expenses of million due to the completion of a class action lawsuit and management s assumption of additional responsibilities  which were previously performed by outside professionals 
o decreased rent expense of k due to the early termination of one of our warehouses in california and the sublease of the existing warehouse space 
o decreases in defective product repair fees of k due to our testing line in our california warehouse 
we have sent fewer real defective products to the factory for repair in fiscal o decreased product licensing royalty of million due to the termination of several licensing agreements 
our dependency on other brands has decreased in the past 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses can be attributed to the fact that we produced fewer models with higher volume per model  which increased the economies of scale for our product lines 
net other expenses net other expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal net other expenses increased because our interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal our interest expense increased because we recorded million for the amortization of the discount on our convertible debentures 
the increase in interest expense was partially offset by other income 
we expect interest expense to maintain the same level for fiscal income before taxes we had a net loss before taxes of  in fiscal compared to a net loss before taxes of  in fiscal the decreased net loss was the result of increased profit margins and decreased expenses in every category 
income tax expense significant management judgment is required in developing our provisions for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets 
management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance when it believes that it is not likely to be realized 
on march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  against which we recorded valuation allowances totaling million and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended march   we did not record income tax expenses 
this occurred because the company had taxable losses for both us operations and hong kong operations 
our subsidiary has applied for an exemption of income tax in hong kong 
therefore  no taxes have been expensed or provided for at the subsidiary level 
although no decision has been reached by the governing body  the parent company has decided to provide for the possibility that the exemption could be denied and accordingly has recorded a provision for hong kong taxes in fiscal and there was no provision for hong kong income taxes in fiscal and fiscal due to the subsidiary s taxable loss 
hong kong income taxes payable totaled million at march  and and is included in the accompanying balance sheets as income taxes payable 
we effectively repatriated approximately  million and million from our foreign operations in  and  respectively 
accordingly  these earnings were taxed as a deemed dividend based on us statutory rates 
we have no remaining undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
net loss net income as a result of the foregoing  we had a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in fiscal fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to million compared to revenues of million in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in net sales was due to both decreases in unit volume as well as pricing  due to increases in competition in the united states and international markets 
in fiscal year  of our sales were direct sales  which represent sales made by international smc  and were domestic sales  which represent sales made from our warehouse in the united states 
the sales decreases occurred in all segments of our business 
our total hardware sales decreased to million  in fiscal compared to total hardware sales of million in fiscal the total decrease of hardware sales of million from the previous year sales level is the primary due to the increasing market competition 
also we had to lower our price in order to move the overstocked inventory from fiscal year in addition  there was a significant decrease in our music sales 
music sales decreased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in music sales is also a result of increased competition in this category  both domestically as well as internationally 
gross profit gross profit for fiscal was  or of total revenues compared to  or of sales for fiscal the decrease in gross margin compared to the prior year is primarily due to the following factors i write down of inventories  ii sales made at lower prices to generate cash from operation  iii increased sales by international smc  the gross profit margin is lower for the sales shipped from hong kong due to the volume discount and reduction of the warehousing and insurance expenses and iv tooling impairment cost of  at the end of fiscal  our inventory levels were much higher than we expected 
we determined that due to liquidation sales  inventory would be sold at a loss  therefore  a decrease in the value of specific inventory items was made 
the total amount of the provision for inventory was million in fiscal compared to a provision of million in fiscal in addition to the write down of inventories  due to competitive price pressure  a significant amount of sales shipped in current year were made at lower margins than in previous years 
in the fourth quarter  we sold million of inventory with a negative margin of  after applying inventory valuation reserves 
our product line did not sell as well as our retailers and mass merchants had expected 
as a result  we agreed to give our customers pricing concessions and allowed them to return inventory to us 
we issued over million in customer credits during the fourth quarter  which reduced our sales and gross profit margins equally 
our gross margins were also negatively affected by the return of million in inventory 
our decrease in our gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal was also reduced by the mix of our sales 
the percentage of sales made by our hong kong subsidiary increased from of the total sales in fiscal to in fiscal usually  sales made by international smc historically maintain a lower gross profit margin because there are no variable expenses from these sales 
other variable expenses that are normally included with sales are advertising allowances  returns and commissions 
our gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities  since some entities include the costs of warehousing  inspection  freight charges and other distribution costs in their cost of sales 
we account for the above expenses as operating expenses and classify them under selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses operating expenses were  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or of net sales in fiscal the primary factors that contributed to the increase in operating expenses are o increased compensation expenses in the amount of  in fiscal of which approximately  was for severance payments to four former executive officers  o increased selling  general and administrative expenses of  due to o increased legal fees in the amount of  of which approximately  was for the class action settlement  and increased consulting fees in the amount of approximately  which was related to consulting work performed by our lender  o increased rent expenses in the amount of  due to the expansion of the warehouse facility in rancho dominguez in fiscal the increase warehouse space was necessary to stock the unanticipated unsold inventories in fiscal year and expenses of  for early termination of the lease in rancho dominguez  california o a write off of the capitalized cost of reorganization of  o increased accounting expenses in the amount of  which was due to the additional work needed to restate our financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and and work required on the filing of certain registration statements and o increased bank fees and loan cost in the amount of  which was related to the loan agreement with lasalle bank 
this increase in expenses was offset by decreases in our advertising expenses and our freight and handling charges in the amount of  and  respectively 
advertising expense consists of two components co operative advertising and direct advertising expense 
co operative advertising is paid directly to the customer and the allowances are based on the amount of sales 
the customer provides copies of advertising on which these funds are spent and is reimbursed after review of such proof of performance 
as we believe that there is a separate and identifiable benefit associated with the co operative advertising  such amounts are recorded as a component of operating expenses 
co operative advertising expenses decreased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal because our sales decreased 
our royalty expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal our royalty expenses in fiscal included a write off of  in pre paid royalties under our licensing agreement with mtv 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this increase in depreciation and amortization expenses can be attributed to our investment in tooling and dies for the new models  in addition to the acceleration in the depreciation method used to write off the useful life of the tools and dies 
net other expenses net other expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal net other expenses increased because our interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal our interest expense increased because we recorded  for the amortization of the discount and related deferred financing fees on our convertible debentures and approximately  relates to interest expense on the lasalle loan  interest on the convertible debentures  interest on the insiders loan  and interest expense incurred at our hong kong subsidiary 
we expect interest expense to increase further in fiscal  as we will have a full year s worth of amortization of the discount on the convertible debentures and related deferred financing fees 
income before taxes we had a net loss before taxes of  in fiscal compared to net income of  in fiscal income tax expense significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance when it believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
at december  and march   we concluded that a valuation allowance was needed against all of our deferred tax assets  as it was not more likely than not that the deferred taxes would be realized 
at march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  against which we recorded valuation allowances totaling million and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a tax provision of  this occurred because the valuation allowance established against our deferred tax assets exceeded the amount of the benefit created from carrying back a portion of the current year s losses 
the carry back of the losses from the current year resulted in an income tax receivable of million  which is included in refundable tax in the accompanying balance sheets 
we have now exhausted our ability to carry back any further losses and therefore will only be able to recognize tax benefits to the extent that we has future taxable income 
our subsidiary has applied for an exemption of income tax in hong kong 
therefore  no taxes have been expensed or provided for at the subsidiary level 
although no decision has been reached by the governing body  the parent company has reached the decision to provide for the possibility that the exemption could be denied and accordingly has recorded a provision for hong kong taxes in fiscal and there was no provision for hong kong income taxes in fiscal due to the subsidiary s net operating loss for the year 
hong kong income taxes payable totaled million at march  and and is included in the accompanying balance sheets as income taxes payable 
we effectively repatriated approximately million  million and million from our foreign operations in  and  respectively 
accordingly  these earnings were taxed as a deemed dividend based on us statutory rates 
we have no remaining undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
net loss net income as a result of the foregoing  we had a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources on march   we had cash on hand of in addition to million of restricted cash and no bank overdrafts compared to cash on hand of million and restricted cash of million and a bank overdraft of million on march  the increase of cash on hand was primarily due to increases in cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by decreases in cash used in investment activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the twelve months ended march  this was the result of better inventory planning and the selling off of overstocked inventory 
cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributed to decreases in inventory  receipt of a federal tax refund and insurance payment  partially offset by decreases of accounts payable  accrued expenses and customer credit on account 
o accounts payable decreases were the result of management s commitment to reduce overdue accounts payable invoices with our major supplier in china  o accrued expenses decreased as a result of a class action settlement in the amount of million  of which  was paid by our insurance company and  was paid with  shares of common stock 
we also paid approximately  for music royalties and million in other expenses 
o customer credit on account decreased because the company paid off some of the customer credit balance or applied the credit balances to new orders 
cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended march  was million 
cash used in investing activities was for the purchase of tooling and molds for the production of new karaoke machines for this fiscal year 
cash flows used by financing activities were million for the fiscal year ended march  this cash outflow was primarily due to cost of paying off a bank overdraft 
as of march   our working capital was million 
our current liabilities of million include o amount due to one factory of million we have worked out the payment plan with the factory to pay off the balance by the end of this year 
o customer credit on account of million the amount of million is due to one customer  of which million credit balance was settled by shipments in june  the remaining amount might be offset by the products or refund 
o convertible debentures of million the debentures expire in february  we might be able to pay off a portion of the debenture before or on the maturity date 
o subordinate debt of million the additional million was converted into common stock in may o hong kong income tax payable of million see income tax expense on page for details we do not expect the complete tax payment to come due in the short term 
our tax exemption application is still pending with the hong kong tax authority 
even if the outcome is unfavorable  the company still has the right to appeal  which could take more than a year to settle 
o current liabilities resulted from normal course of the business of million 
as of june   our loan balance with crestmark bank was million 
the company can borrow up to the lesser of the million or of the eligible accounts receivable 
per the agreement we are only allowed to factor the sales originating from the warehouses in the united states 
the factor company determines the eligible receivables based on their own credit standard  and the accounts aging 
as of june   there was no availability under the crestmark facility due to low sales volume during the slow selling season 
our hong kong subsidiary  international smc  has access to credit facilities at the hong kong shanghai bank and fortis bank 
the primary purpose of the facilities is to provide international smc with access to letters of credit so that it can purchase inventory for direct shipment of goods into the united states and international markets 
the facilities are secured by a corporate guarantee from the us parent company and restricted cash on deposit with the lender 
the maximum available credit under the facilities is million 
the balance as of march  and was and  respectively 
the interest rate is approximate per annum 
as of june   the availability from these facilities was million as of june   our cash on hand is limited 
our average monthly operating expenses are approximately  and we need approximately million to cover our operating expenses during the next three month period 
our primary expenses are normal operating costs including salaries  lease payments for our warehouse space in compton  california and other operating costs 
as of march   our commitments for debt and other contractual arrangements are summarized as follows less than over total year years years years property leases    equipment leases     subordinated debt related party   convertible debentures   interest payments   total     each of the contractual agreements except the equipment leases provide that all amounts due under that agreement can be accelerated if we default under the terms of the agreement 
working capital requirements during the short and long term during the next twelve month period  we plan on financing our working capital needs from o the collection of accounts receivable  o sales of existing inventory  o financial companies willing to makes advances on accounts receivable  o short term insider loans  o the continued support of factories in china that finance our purchases of karaoke machines for fiscal  and o the utilization of credit facilities that are available to international smc to finance all direct shipments 
our sources of cash for working capital in the long term are the same as our sources during the short term 
if we need additional financing  we intend to approach different financing companies or insiders 
however  we cannot guarantee that our financing plan will succeed 
if we need to obtain additional financing and fail to do so  it may have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and continue our operations 
during fiscal  we will strive to reduce additional operating costs 
in order to reduce the need to maintain inventory in our warehouse in california and florida  we intend to generate a larger share of our total sales through sales directly from international smc 
the goods are shipped directly to our customers from ports in china and are primarily backed by customer letters of credit 
the customers take title to the merchandise at their consolidators in china and are responsible for the shipment  duty  clearance and freight charges to their locations 
these sales in which the customer purchases the goods for delivery at a specific destination are referred to as direct sales 
we will also help our customers forecast and manage their inventories of our product 
we are also planning to finance a significant amount of our sales with customer issued letters of credit  using international smc s credit facility with hong kong bank and relying on financing from one of our factories in china 
in the event that we do not sell sufficient products in our second and third quarters  we have considered other sources of financing  such as trying to secure an additional credit facility  private offerings and or a venture capital investment 
we expect that the profit margin for sales of our karaoke products will continue to be under price pressure  because of the competitors in the marketplace 
during fiscal  we plan on introducing products other than karaoke to fulfill our sales seasonality gap 
except for the foregoing  we do not have any present commitment that is likely to cause our liquidity to increase or decrease in any material way 
in addition  except for the company s need for additional capital to finance inventory purchases  the company is not aware of any trend  additional demand  event or uncertainty that will result in  or that is reasonably likely to result in  the company s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
exchange rates we sell all of our products in us dollars and pay for all of our manufacturing costs in either us or hong kong dollars 
operating expenses of the hong kong office are paid in hong kong dollars 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
seasonal and quarterly results historically  our operations have been seasonal  with the highest net sales occurring in the second and third quarters reflecting increased orders for equipment and music merchandise during the christmas selling months and to a lesser extent the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
sales in our fiscal second and third quarter  combined  accounted for approximately  and of net sales in fiscal  and our results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of orders placed and shipped to customers  as well as other factors 
the fulfillment of orders can therefore significantly affect results of operations on a quarter to quarter basis 
we are currently developing the products and considering trading products other than karaoke category during the slow season to fulfill the revenue shortfall 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company has historically passed any price increases on to its customers since prices charged by the company are generally not fixed by long term contracts 
critical accounting policies we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results included accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves on inventory  deferred tax assets and our hong kong income tax exemption 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
the singing machine s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of its customers  current economic conditions and historical information  and  in the opinion of management  is believed to be an amount sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
management sets reserves for customers in bankruptcy and other reserves based upon historical collection experience 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major customer default on its obligations to the company  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact on operations 
reserves on inventories 
the singing machine establishes a reserve on inventory based on the expected net realizable value of inventory on an item by item basis when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of an inventory item falls below its original cost 
a charge to cost of sales results when the estimated net realizable value of specific inventory items declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for such declines in value 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance when it believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
at march  and  we concluded that a valuation allowance was needed against all of our deferred tax assets  as it was not likely that the deferred taxes would be realized 
at march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  against which we recorded valuation allowances totaling million and  respectively 
for the fiscal years ended march  and march   the company recorded a tax provision of and  respectively 
we have received the tax refund of million on august   which has been used to pay related parties loan and the vendors 
the company has now exhausted its ability to carry back any further losses and therefore will only be able to recognize tax benefits to the extent that it has future taxable income 
the company s subsidiary has applied for an exemption of income tax in hong kong 
therefore  no taxes have been expensed or provided for at the subsidiary level 
although no decision has been reached by the governing body  the parent company has reached the decision to provide for the possibility that the exemption could be denied and accordingly has recorded a provision for hong kong taxes in fiscal and there was no provision for hong kong income taxes in fiscal and fiscal due to the subsidiary s net operating losses 
hong kong income taxes payable totaled million at march  and and is included in the accompanying balance sheets as income taxes payable 
the company effectively repatriated approximately  million and million from its foreign operations in  and  respectively 
accordingly  these earnings were taxed as a deemed dividend based on us statutory rates 
the company has no remaining undistributed earnings of the company s foreign subsidiary 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
we make other estimates in the ordinary course of business relating to sales returns and allowances  warranty reserves  and reserves for promotional incentives 
historically  past changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on our financial condition 
however  circumstances could change which may alter future expectations 
set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in the other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock risks associated with our business we have significant working capital needs and if we are unable to obtain additional financing  when needed  we may not have sufficient cash flow to run our business 
as of june   our cash on hand is limited 
we need approximately million in working capital in order to finance our operations over the next three months 
we will finance our working capital needs from the collection of accounts receivable  and sales of existing inventory 
see liquidity beginning on page as of march   our inventory was valued at million 
if these sources do not provide us with adequate financing  we may try to seek financing from a third party 
if we are not able to obtain adequate financing  when needed  it will have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to run our business 
if we have a severe shortage of working capital  we may not be able to continue our business operations and may be required to file a petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code or enter into some other form of liquidation or reorganization proceeding 
we may be deemed insolvent and we may go out of business 
as of march   our cash position is limited 
we are not able to pay all of our creditors on a timely basis 
we are current on approximately of our accounts payable  which total million as march  we are not current on our account payable of million to our factory in china 
if we are not able to pay our current debts as they become due  we may be deemed to be insolvent 
we may be required to file a petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code or enter into some other form of liquidation or reorganization proceedings 
our independent registered public accounting firms raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of march  we received a report dated june  from our independent certified public accountants covering the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended march  that included an explanatory paragraph which stated that the financial statements were prepared assuming the singing machine would continue as a going concern 
this report stated that our operating performance in fiscal and our minimal liquidity raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
if we are not able to raise additional capital  we may need to curtail or stop our business operations 
we may be required to file a petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code or enter into some other form of liquidation or reorganization proceedings 
a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our revenues  and the loss of one or more of these key customers could significantly reduce our revenues and cash flow 
we rely on a few large customers to provide a substantial portion of our revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  our net sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal period ended march   and were approximately  and respectively 
in fiscal  three customers accounted for  and of our net sales 
we do not have long term contractual arrangements with any of our customers and they can cancel their orders at any time prior to delivery 
a substantial reduction in or termination of orders from any of our largest customers would decrease our revenues and cash flow 
we are relying on one factory to manufacture and produce the majority of our karaoke machines for fiscal  and if the relationship with this factory is damaged or injured in any way  it would reduce our revenues and profitability 
we have worked out a written agreement with a factory in china to produce most of our karaoke machines for fiscal we owe this factory approximately million as of june  and have worked out a verbal payment plan with it 
see liquidity beginning on page if the factory is unwilling or unable to deliver our karaoke machines to us  our business will be adversely affected 
because our cash on hand is minimal  we are relying on revenues received from the sale of our ordered karaoke machines to provide cash flow for our operations 
if we do not receive cash from these sales  we may not be able to continue our business operations 
we are relying on one distributor to distribute our music products  if the distribution agreement is terminated  it would reduce our revenues and profitability 
we are relying on warner brother publication to distribute our music products in fiscal  if the distribution agreement is terminated  our music revenues might decrease as well as our profitability 
we are subject to the risk that some of our large customers may return karaoke products that they have purchased from us and if this happens  it would reduce our revenues and profitability 
in fiscal and  a number of our customers and distributors returned karaoke products that they had purchased from us 
our customers returned goods valued at million  or of our net sales in fiscal some of the returns were resulted from the customer s overstock of the products 
although we were not contractually obligated to accept this return of the products in fiscal or fiscal  we accepted the return of the products because we valued our relationship with our customers 
because we are dependent upon a few large customers  we are subject to the risk that any of these customers may elect to return unsold karaoke products to us in the future 
if any of our customers were to return karaoke products to us  it would reduce our revenues and profitability 
we are subject to pressure from our customers relating to price reduction and financial incentives and if we are pressured to make these concessions to our customers  it will reduce our revenues and profitability 
because there is intense competition in the karaoke industry  we are subject to pricing pressure from our customers 
many of our customers have demanded that we lower our prices or they will buy our competitor s products 
if we do not meet our customer s demands for lower prices  we will not sell as many karaoke products 
in our fiscal year ended march   our sales to customers in the united states decreased because of increased price competition 
we are also subject to pressure from our customers regarding certain financial incentives  such as return credits or large advertising or cooperative advertising allowances  which effectively reduce our profit 
we gave advertising allowances in the amount of million during fiscal and million during fiscal we have historically offered advertising allowances to our customers because it is standard practice in the retail industry 
we experience difficulty forecasting the demand for our karaoke products and if we do not accurately forecast demand  our revenues  net income and cash flow may be affected 
because of our reliance on manufacturers in china for our machine production  our production lead times range from one to four months 
therefore  we must commit to production in advance of customers orders 
it is difficult to forecast customer demand because we do not have any scientific or quantitative method to predict this demand 
our forecasting is based on management s general expectations about customer demand  the general strength of the retail market and management s historical experiences 
we overestimated demand for our products in fiscal and and had million in inventory as of march  because of this excess inventory  we had liquidity problems in fiscal and our revenues  net income and cash flow were adversely affected we are subject to the costs and risks of carrying inventory for our customers and if we have too much inventory  it will affect our revenues and net income 
many of our customers place orders with us several months prior to the holiday season  but they schedule delivery two or three weeks before the holiday season begins 
as such  we are subject to the risks and costs of carrying inventory during the time period between the placement or the order and the delivery date  which reduces our cash flow 
as of march   we had million in inventory on hand  which impacted our cash flow and liquidity from operations in fiscal as of march   our inventory was valued at million  after a million reserve had been taken 
it is important that we sell this inventory during fiscal  so we have sufficient cash flow for operations 
our gross profit margins have decreased over the past year and we expect competitive market 
over the past year  our gross profit margins have generally decreased due to the competition except for fiscal since we have developed the several new models  which yield higher profit margin 
we expect that our gross profit margin might decrease under downward pressure in fiscal we may be unable to successfully defend ourselves in the sybersound lawsuit and our cash flow could be affected 
the cost to defend ourselves may be substantial and our net profitability may be affected 
we are currently defending ourselves in a lawsuit filed by sybersound records  inc  d b a party tyme karaoke  which seeks damages of more than million 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves and are forced to pay the judgment our cash flow could be affected 
alternatively  the cost of successfully defending ourselves may also be great and may adversely affect our net profitability 
our licensing agreement with mtv networks is important to our business and if we were to lose our mtv license it would affect our revenues and profitability 
our license with mtv networks is important to our business 
we generated and of our consolidated net sales from products sold under the mtv license in fiscal and  respectively 
our mtv license was terminated on december   with an extension to sell certain existing inventory by september  we expect the mtv branded products will be phased out and replaced with smc brand products going forward 
our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend  in large part  on our sales during the relatively brief holiday season 
sales of consumer electronics and toy products in the retail channel are highly seasonal  with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season  which includes christmas 
a substantial majority of our sales occur during the second quarter ended september and the third quarter ended december sales in our second and third quarter  combined  accounted for approximately  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
if we are unable to compete in the karaoke products category  our revenues and net profitability will be reduced 
our major competitors for karaoke machines and related products are craig and memorex 
we believe that competition for karaoke machines is based primarily on price  product features  reputation  delivery times  and customer support 
our primary competitors for producing karaoke music are compass  pocket songs  sybersound  uav and sound choice 
we believe that competition for karaoke music is based primarily on popularity of song titles  price  reputation  and delivery times 
to the extent that we lower prices to attempt to enhance or retain market share  we may adversely impact our operating margins 
conversely  if we opt not to match competitor s price reductions we may lose market share  resulting in decreased volume and revenue 
to the extent our leading competitors reduce prices on their karaoke machines and music  we must remain flexible to reduce our prices 
if we are forced to reduce our prices  it will result in lower margins and reduced profitability 
because of intense competition in the karaoke industry in the united states during fiscal  we expect that the intense pricing pressure in the low end of the market will continue in the karaoke market in the united states in fiscal in addition  we must compete with all the other existing forms of entertainment including  but not limited to motion pictures  video arcade games  home video games  theme parks  nightclubs  television  prerecorded tapes  cd s and video cassettes 
if we are unable to develop new karaoke products  our revenues may not continue to grow 
the karaoke industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements and ongoing customer demands for greater performance 
in addition  the average selling price of any karaoke machine has historically decreased over its life  and we expect that trend to continue 
as a result  our products may not be competitive if we fail to introduce new products or product enhancements that meet evolving customer demands 
the development of new products is complex  and we may not be able to complete development in a timely manner 
to introduce products on a timely basis  we must o accurately define and design new products to meet market needs  o design features that continue to differentiate our products from those of our competitors  o transition our products to new manufacturing process technologies  o identify emerging technological trends in our target markets  o anticipate changes in end user preferences with respect to our customers products  o bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  and o respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by others 
we believe that we will need to continue to enhance our karaoke machines and develop new machines to keep pace with competitive and technological developments and to achieve market acceptance for our products 
at the same time  we need to identify and develop other products which may be different from karaoke machines 
our products are shipped from china and any disruption of shipping could prevent or delay our customers receipt of inventory 
we rely principally on four contract ocean carriers to ship virtually all of the products that we import to our warehouse facility in compton california 
retailers that take delivery of our products in china rely on a variety of carriers to import those products 
any disruptions in shipping  whether in california or china  caused by labor strikes  other labor disputes  terrorism  and international incidents may prevent or delay our customers receipt of inventory 
if our customers do not receive their inventory on a timely basis  they may cancel their orders or return products to us 
consequently  our revenues and net income would be reduced 
our manufacturing operations are located in the people s republic of china  subjecting us to risks common in international operations 
if there is any problem with the manufacturing process  our revenues and net profitability may be reduced 
we are using nine factories in the people s republic of china to manufacture the majority of our karaoke machines 
these factories will be producing approximately of our karaoke products in fiscal our arrangements with these factories are subject to the risks of doing business abroad  such as import duties  trade restrictions  work stoppages  and foreign currency fluctuations  limitations on the repatriation of earnings and political instability  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
furthermore  we have limited control over the manufacturing processes themselves 
as a result  any difficulties encountered by our third party manufacturers that result in product defects  production delays  cost overruns or the inability to fulfill orders on a timely basis could adversely affect our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
also  since we do not have written agreements with any of these factories  we are subject to additional uncertainty if the factories do not deliver products to us on a timely basis 
we depend on third party suppliers for parts for our karaoke machines and related products  and if we cannot obtain supplies as needed  our operations will be severely damaged 
our growth and ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our capability to obtain timely deliveries of karaoke machines and our electronic products 
we rely on third party suppliers to produce the parts and materials we use to manufacture and produce these products 
if our suppliers are unable to provide our factories with the parts and supplies  we will be unable to produce our products 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to purchase the parts we need at reasonable prices or in a timely fashion 
in the last several years  there have been shortages of certain chips that we use in our karaoke machines 
if we are unable to anticipate any shortages of parts and materials in the future  we may experience severe production problems  which would impact our sales 
consumer discretionary spending may affect karaoke purchases and is affected by various economic conditions and changes 
our business and financial performance may be damaged more than most companies by adverse financial conditions affecting our business or by a general weakening of the economy 
purchases of karaoke machines and music are considered discretionary for consumers 
our success will therefore be influenced by a number of economic factors affecting discretionary and consumer spending  such as employment levels  business  interest rates  and taxation rates  all of which are not under our control 
additionally  other extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks or military engagements  which adversely affect the retail environment may restrict consumer spending and thereby adversely affect our sales growth and profitability 
we may have infringed the copyrights of certain music publishers and if we violate federal copyright laws  we will be subject to monetary penalties 
over the past several years  we have received notices from several music publishers who have alleged that we did not have the proper copyright licenses to sell certain songs included in our compact discs with graphics discs cdg s 
cdg s are compact discs which contain the musical recordings of the karaoke songs and graphics which contain the lyrics of the songs 
we have settled or are in the process of settling all of these copyright infringement issues with these publishers 
we have spent approximately  to settle these copyright infringement suits in fiscal year and these copyright infringement claims may have a negative effect on our ability to sell our music products to our customers 
if we do not have the proper copyright licenses for any other songs that are included in our cd g s and cassettes  we will be subject to additional liability under the federal copyright laws  which could include settlements with the music publishers and payment of monetary damages 
see legal proceedings 
we may be subject to claims from third parties for unauthorized use of their proprietary technology  copyrights or trade secrets and any claims asserted against us could affect our net profitability 
we believe that we independently developed the technology used in our electronic and audio software products and that it does not infringe on the proprietary rights  copyrights or trade secrets of others 
however  we cannot assure you that we have not infringed on the proprietary rights of third parties or those third parties will not make infringement violation claims against us 
during fiscal  tanashin denki  ltd  a japanese company that holds a patent on a cassette tape drive mechanism alleged that some of our karaoke machines violated their patents 
we settled the matters with tanashin in december subsequently in december  tanashin again alleged that some of our karaoke machines violated their patents 
we entered into another settlement agreement with them in may in addition to tanashin  we could receive infringement claims from other third parties 
any infringement claims may have a negative effect on our profitability and financial condition 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers  who are experiencing financial difficulties  and if these customers are unable to pay us  our revenues and profitability will be reduced 
we sell products to retailers  including department stores  lifestyle merchants  direct mail retailers  which are catalogs and showrooms  national chains  specialty stores  and warehouse clubs 
some of these retailers  such as k mart  fao schwarz and kb toys  have engaged in leveraged buyouts or transactions in which they incurred a significant amount of debt  and operated under the protection of bankruptcy laws 
as of june   we are aware of only two customers  fao schwarz and kb toys  which are operating under the protection of bankruptcy laws 
deterioration in the financial condition of our customers could result in bad debt expense to us and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and future profitability 
a disruption in the operation of our warehouse centers in california or florida could impact our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
a significant amount of our merchandise is shipped to our customers from one of our two warehouses  which are located in compton  california  and coconut creek  florida 
events such as fire or other catastrophic events  any malfunction or disruption of our centralized information systems or shipping problems may result in delays or disruptions in the timely distribution of merchandise to our customers  which could substantially decrease our revenues and profitability 
our business operations could be disrupted if there are labor problems on the west coast 
during fiscal  approximately of our sales were domestic warehouse sales  which were made from our warehouses in california and florida 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the dock strike on the west coast affected sales of two of our karaoke products and we estimate that we lost between and million in orders because we couldn t get the containers of these products off the pier 
if another strike or work slow down occurs and we do not have a sufficient level of inventory  a strike or work slow down would result in increased costs to us and may reduce our profitability 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile which may cause investors to lose all or a portion of their investment 
from june  through june   our common stock has traded between a high of and a low of 
during this period  we have lost senior executives and board members  had liquidity problems  and incurred a net loss of million in fiscal our stock price may continue to be volatile based on similar or other adverse developments in our business 
in addition  the stock market periodically experiences significant adverse price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
if investors short our securities  it may cause our stock price to decline 
during the past year  a number of investors have held a short position in our common stock 
as of may   investors hold a short position in  shares of our common stock which represents of our public float 
the anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of our stock by some institutions or individuals who engage in short sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline 
additionally  if our stock price declines  it may be more difficult for us to raise capital 
our obligation to make severance payments could prevent or delay takeovers 
our employment agreement with yi ping chan requires us  under certain conditions  to make substantial severance payments to him if he resigns after a change of control 
as of march   mr 
chan is entitled to severance payments of  these provisions could delay or impede a merger  tender offer or other transaction resulting in a change in control of the singing machine  even if such a transaction would have significant benefits to our shareholders 
as a result  these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
see executive compensation employment agreements on page risks associated with our capital structure our common stock may be delisted from the american stock exchange  which may have a material adverse impact on the pricing and trading of our common stock 
our common stock is quoted on the american stock exchange amex 
the amex  as a matter of policy  will consider the suspension of trading in  or removal from listing of  any stock when  in the opinion of amex  i the financial condition and or operating results of an issuer appear to be unsatisfactory  ii it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the stock has become so reduced as to make further dealings on the amex inadvisable  iii the issuer has sold or otherwise disposed of its principal operating assets  or iv the issuer has sustained losses which are so substantial in relation to its overall operations or its existing financial condition has become so impaired that it appears questionable  in the opinion of amex  whether the issuer will be able to continue operations and or meet its obligations as they mature 
as of june   we have not received any notices from amex notifying us that they will delist us 
however  we cannot assure you that amex will not take any actions in the near future to delist our common stock 
if our common stock were delisted from the amex  we would trade on the over the counter bulletin board and the market price for shares or our common stock could decline 
further  if our common stock is removed from listing on amex  it may become more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock 
if our outstanding derivative securities are exercised or converted  our existing shareholders will suffer dilution 
as of march   there were outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from 
to per share  not all of which are immediately exercisable 
the weighted average exercise price of the outstanding stock options is approximately per share 
as of march   there were outstanding immediately exercisable option to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
there were outstanding stock warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share  all of which are exercisable 
the weighted average exercise price of the outstanding stock warrants is approximately per share 
in addition  we have issued  of convertible debentures  which are convertible into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
to the extent that the aforementioned convertible securities are exercised or converted  dilution to our stockholders will occur 
the million private placement that we closed in september will affect our ability to raise capital in the future 
on september   we closed a private offering in which we issued million of convertible debentures and stock purchase warrants to six institutional investors 
as part of this investment  we agreed to several limitations on our corporate actions  some of which limit our ability to raise financing in the future 
if we enter into any financing transactions prior to january   we need to offer the institutional investors the right to participate in such offering in an amount equal to the greater of a the principal amount of the debentures currently outstanding or b of the financing offered to the outside investment group 
for example  if we offer to sell million worth of our securities to an outside investment group  the institutional investors will have the right to purchase up to million of the offering 
this right may affect our ability to attract other investors if we require external financing to remain in operations 
furthermore  for a period of days after the effective date of the registration statement registering shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible debentures and the warrants  we cannot sell any securities 
additionally  we cannot o sell any of our securities in any transactions where the exercise price is adjusted based on the trading price of our common stock at any time after the initial issuance of such securities 
o sell any securities which grant investors the right to receive additional shares based on any future transaction on terms more favorable than those granted to the investor in the initial offering these limitations are in place until the earlier of february  or the date on which all the debentures are converted into shares of our common stock 
if we sell any of our securities at a price lower than per share  the conversion price of our debentures at per share will be reduced and there will be additional dilution to our shareholders 
given that our common stock is trading at a price of per share as of june   it is possible that we may need to sell additional securities for capital at a price lower than per share 
if we sell any securities at a price lower than per share  the conversion price of our debentures currently set at per share will be reduced and there will be more dilution to our shareholders if and when the debentures are converted into shares of our common stock 
the set price will be reduced by an amount equal to of the difference between the set price and effective purchase price of such shares 
future sales of our common stock held by current stockholders and investors may depress our stock price 
as of march   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding 
of these shares  approximately  shares are eligible for sale under rule we have filed two registration statements registering an aggregate  of shares of our common stock a registration statement on form s to register the sale of  shares underlying options granted under our stock option plan and a registration statement on form s to register  shares of our common stock underlying options granted under our year stock option plan 
an additional registration statement on form s  of which this prospectus is a part  was filed in october  registering an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could drop due to the sale of large number of shares of our common stock  such as the shares sold pursuant to the registration statements or under rule  or the perception that these sales could occur 
our stock price may decrease if we issue additional shares of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding and an aggregate of  shares issuable under our outstanding options and warrants 
we also have an obligation to issue up to  shares upon conversion of our debentures and have reserved  additional shares for interest payment on the debentures 
as such  our board of directors has the power  without stockholder approval  to issue up to  shares of common stock 
any issuance of additional shares of common stock  whether by us to new stockholders or the exercise of outstanding warrants or options  may result in a reduction of the book value or market price of our outstanding common stock 
issuance of additional shares will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of our then existing stockholders 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law make it difficult for a third party to acquire our company and could depress the price of our common stock 
delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation include authorizing our board of directors to issue additional preferred stock  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of march   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize market risk 
interest rate risk as or march   we do not have any exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
we have million in convertible notes  which have a fixed interest rate of effective as of november  foreign currency risk we have a wholly owned subsidiary in hong kong 
sales by these operations made on a fob china or hong kong basis are dominated in us dollars 
however  purchases of inventory and hong kong operating expenses are typically denominated in hong kong dollars  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
we do not believe that near term changes in the exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of the hong kong dollar
