customers aerospace defense group 
in  our aerospace defense group sold approximately of its products in north america  with the balance sold internationally 
sales of aerospace defense group products to all branches of the united states military and its prime contractors such as am general  boeing sikorsky aircraft and stewart stevenson represented approximately of th e aerospace defense group s revenue 
the aerospace defense group s businesses have relied to a great extent on relatively few major customers  although saw the development of additional major users of aerospace defense group products within their existing customer base eg other users within the eg army 
we believe that historical customers  such as the us army and other branches of the us military  to whom we have supplied products for approximately years  will continue to be major customers 
current commercial and licensing customers include boeing  bell helicopter textron  second chance body armor  ppg industries  intercast europe  and avon rubber company 
the loss of or significant reduction in sales to a major customer could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business  operations and financial condition 
the market for military hardware products is worldwide in scope  including the us military and foreign defense forces 
the primary contract for delivery of up armored hmmwvs is with the us military  although smaller quantities are also sold overseas 
the primary contracts for the armor kit programs are with the us military 
our aerospace defense group also serves as a subcontractor to provide ballistically armored and sealed truck cabs for himars for use by th e us army and the us marine corps  a program that transitioned to low rate initial production in and continued in products division 
in  the products division sold approximately of its products in north america  with the balance sold internationally 
the primary end users of the products division s products are federal  state and local law enforcement agencies  local police departments  state corrections facilities  us and allied militaries  highway patrols and sheriffs departments

our gregory r brand of products are sold primarily in north america and such sales represent approximately of gregory sales 
mobile security division 
in  the mobile security division sold approximately of its products in north america  with the balance sold internationally 
the mobile security division s armored commercial vehicle customers include governmental and private buyers who purchase both fully and light armored vehicles 
governmental buyers and foreign royalty are also customers for parade cars 
typically  governmental buyers consist of ministries of foreign affairs  defense and internal affairs and offices of presidential security 
these customers are not constrained in their purchasing decisions by considerations such as import duties and taxes and are free to search globally for the best product available 
the procurement cycles of governmental buyers can range from relatively rapid  when the vehicles are for the use of the head of state or in response to a particular crisis  to prolonged highly documented bids and evaluations for normally budgeted items 
private customers for armored commercial vehicles include corporations and individuals 
private buyers tend t o be more price sensitive and will often purchase locally manufactured vehicles t o reduce taxes and avoid import duties 
local servicing of the vehicle is also a critical concern to private buyers 
customers for cash in transit vehicles are generally companies that provide cash in transit services to financial institutions 
purchasing decisions for cash in transit vehicles depend on many criteria including insurance  regulatory requirements and costs  and whether th e financial institution is private or governmental 
approximately of our revenues were from our ten largest customers for the year ended december  fiscal 
approximately of our revenues came from us military contracts 
our aerospace defense group s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of aerospace defense grou p revenues for fiscal the products division s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues of the products division fo r fiscal the mobile security division s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues of the mobile security division for fisca l military and governmental contracts generally are awarded on a periodic o r sporadic basis

marketing and distribution aerospace defense group 
most of the aerospace defense group s products are distributed as a component supplier to original equipment manufacturers oems or as a direct contractor to the us government 
the products are built to order 
we do not directly serve mass consumer markets and supply directly from manufacturing facilities 
thus  the distribution of the aerospace defense group s products does not involve significant inventory  warehousing or shippin g methodologies 
depending upon the product  we typically employ one of four methods for marketing i direct sales  ii technical teams  typically comprised of a combination of sales personnel and engineers  iii strategic alliances with oems and us government prime contractors  and iv responses to formal reques t for proposals in bidding for government contracts 
in marketing our safety restraint and seating products  we endeavor to maintain close relationships with existing customers and to establish new customer relationships

in marketing its products to the military  the aerospace defense group places strong emphasis on its superior antitank and antipersonnel mine protection for the occupants of tactical wheeled vehicles 
we market our military products through a combination of trade show exhibitions  print advertising in military related periodicals and direct customer visits 
we emphasize the cross marketing of military and commercial products  which we believe strengthens the image of each product group 
we have also entered into exclusive teaming and joint marketing agreements with various prime contractors in connection with the up armored hmmwv and up armoring for himars and family o f medium tactical vehicles fmtv for sales in domestic and international military and commercial areas 
such agreements allow us to benefit from the prime contractor s marketing network and save on certain selling costs 
additionally  the aerospace defense group focuses on the individual warrior soldier  marine  seaman  and airman 
this focus area for the company encompasses those programs where products are worn or carried by the individual which increases their survivability and mobility 
current programs include the otv  molle  and the warrior advanced combat helmet ach

kroll  inc matters o gara hess eisenhardt armoring de brasil ltda 
ohe brazil was assessed million reals us million based on the exchange rate as of december  by the brazilian tax authorities 
ohe brazil has appealed the tax assessments and the cases are pending 
to the extent that there may be any liability resulting from such assessments  we believe that we are entitled to indemnification from kroll  inc for up to million under the terms of our purchase agreement dated april   because the events in question with respect to up to million of such assessments occurred prior to our purchas e of the o gara companies from kroll  inc in and prior to our acquisition of oheac in  several of the former employees of kroll o gara company de mexico  sa de sa o gara mexico  a subsidiary of oheac  commenced labor claims against o gara mexico seeking damages for unjustified termination 
in late  the principal labor claim wa s settled by us for approximately million and two of the remaining claims were settled for approximately  we believe that we are entitled to indemnification from kroll  inc with respect to these settlement payments and we are currently engaged in discussions with kroll  inc with respect to this matter 
in december  o gara hess eisenhardt france sa  which was acquired from kroll  inc ohe france  sold its industrial bodywork business operated unde r the name labbe division de o gara hess eisenhardt france carrosserie industriells carrosserie to snc labbe 
subsequent to the sale  the labbe family trust lft  owner of the leasehold interest upon which the carrosseri e business is operated  sued ohe france and snc labbe claiming that the transfer of the leasehold was not valid because lft had not given its consent to the transfer as required under the terms of the lease 
lft sought to have ohe france  as the sole tenant  maintain and repair the leased building with an estimated cost of between us and us million  based on the exchange rate as of december  the case is currently pending  and while we are contesting the allegations vigorously  we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
although we do not have any insurance coverage for this matter  at this time  we do not believe this matter will have a material impact on our financial position  operations or liquidity 
matters involving zylon r fiber in april  two class action lawsuits were filed against us in florida state court by police organizations and individual police officers  alleging  among other things  that our bullet resistant soft body armor vests manufactured an d sold under the american body armor tm  safariland r and protech tm brands  d o not have the qualities and performance characteristics as warranted  thereby breaching express warranty  implied warranty of merchantability  implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose and duty to warn 
on august   we reached a preliminary settlement with respect to the class action lawsuit filed in duval county  florida by the southern states police benevolent association southern states pba 
after fairness hearings were held  the florida circuit court gave final approval to that settlement on november  the other class action lawsuit filed against us by the national association of police organizations  inc napo  in lee county  florida  was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice on november  pursuant to the terms of the class action settlement with the southern states pba  the warranty on the american body armor tm xtreme r zx vest both nij threat level ii and iiia has been reduced from years to years 
in addition  every purchaser of an xtreme r zx vest has the option to exchange their vest for either a new zx vest or any other vest of their choosing from th e american body armor tm  safariland r and protech tm product lines plus a transferable rebate coupon applicable towards their next purchase of a vest 
we have also made available on the american body armor tm website testing data  protocols and results relating to the testing of our vests 
we also continue to test all of our zylon r containing vests  and if such testing demonstrates that the tested vests fail to perform in accordance with their warranties  we will implement an exchange program for those models o n a reasonably comparable basis to the american body armor tm xtreme r zx exchange program outlined above 
zylon r fiber is made by toyobo  a japanese corporation  and is a ballistic fiber widely used in the entire body armor industry 
a final report to the duval county court regarding implementation of the settlement  exchange of vests and on going testing  will be filed on or before april  we are also voluntarily cooperating with a request received in december from the department of justice who is reviewing the entire industry s use of zylon r fiber in bullet resistant vests 
it should be stressed that our vests are certified by the national institute of justice  have never suffered any penetration in the field and continue to save lives and protect officers from injury 
in fact  neither of the two resolved class action lawsuits alleged personal injuries of any kind 
second chance body armor  one of our competitors in the bullet resistant market licenses from simula a certain patented technology which is used in some of the body armor it manufactures  but to our knowledge  no lawsuit has been brought against second chance based upon this licensed technology 
although simula may be impacted by the pending suits filed against second chance regarding its zylon r containing vests  the licensed technology is not specifically related to the use of zylon r fiber 
any adverse resolution of these matters  however  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
other matters in addition to the above  in the normal course of business  we are subjected to various types of claims and currently have on going litigations in the areas of products liability  general liability and intellectual property 
our products are used in a wide variety of law enforcement situations and environments 
some of our products can cause serious personal or property injury or death if not carefully and properly used by adequately trained personnel 
we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for most claims that are incurred in the norma l course of business 
in such cases  the effect on our financial statements is generally limited to the amount of our insurance deductible or self insured retention 
our annual insurance premiums and self insurance retention amounts have risen significantly over the past several years and may continue to do so to the extent we are able to purchase insurance coverage 
at this time  we do not believe any such claims or pending litigation will have a material impact o n our financial position  operations and liquidity

the remaining division in nti  consisting primarily of training services  has been included as part of the products division segment  where management now resides 
this business represented the last remaining business in the services division 
the assets an d liabilities of the services division have been classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on our consolidated balance sheets and the results of their operations classified as income loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

we received  in cash at closing and a note receivable of  which we collected in full in the year ended december  we recorded a loss of million on the sale in the fourth quarter of primarily due to unrealized foreign currency translation loss 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses  which are included in equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  are not recognized until the period in which the related assets and liabilities are disposed of 
on april   we announced that we had completed the sale of our armorgrou p integrated systems business through the sale of of the stock of armorgroup integrated systems  inc and low voltage systems technologies  inc

we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtfu l accounts  derivative instruments and hedging activities  goodwill  patents  licenses  and trademarks  the use of estimates  income taxes  impairment  discontinued operations  and comprehensive income and foreign currency translation 
revenue recognition 
we record products revenue at the time of shipment 
return s are minimal and do not materially affect the financial statements 
we record aerospace defense group revenue related to government contracts which results principally from fixed price contracts and is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally  all of these conditions are met when the company ships products to its customers 
up armored hmmwv units sold to the us government are considered sold when the onsite department of defense officer finishes the inspection of the up armored hmmwv  approves it for delivery and shipment occurs 
revenues related to nonrefundable license fees that are payable at the initiation of a licensing agreement are recognized immediately in income when received or when collectibility is reasonably assured  provided that there are no future obligations or performanc e requirements 
non refundable license fees that are in essence  a prepayment of future royalties  are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the initial license 
we record revenue of the aerospace defense group and mobile security division when a vehicle is shipped  except for larger commercial contracts typically longer than four months in length and the contract for the delivery of up armored hmmwvs to the us government  which continues through revenue from large commercial contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion  units of work performed method 
should large commercial contracts be in a loss position  the entire estimated loss would be recognized for the balance of the contract at such time 
current contracts are profitable 
we record service revenue as services are provided on a contract by contract basis 
revenues from service contracts are recognized over the term of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we encounter risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
as such  we review our accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis and determine a provision for accounts receivable that is considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  we primarily review accounts greater than ninety days past due and estimate the amount that is uncollectible periodically  we compare the identified credit risks with the allowance that ha s been established using historical experience and adjusts the allowance accordingly 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we account for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedge activities sfas as amended 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  depending on the type of hedge transaction 
for fair value hedge transactions in which we hedge changes in an asset s  liability s  or firm commitment s fair value  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will generally be offset in the income statement by changes in the hedged item s fair value 
we adopted sfas in the first quarter of however  we had n o derivatives to be measured at the time of adoption 
we do not hold or issue interest rate swap agreements or other derivative instruments for trading purposes 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements offset changes i n the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in the market interest rate 
accordingly  the other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december  increased by  which reflected an increase in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements to million 
the corresponding increase in the hedge liability was recorded in long term debt 
the agreements are deemed to be a perfectly effective fair value hedge and therefore qualify for the short cut method of accounting under sfas as a result  no ineffectiveness is expected to be recognized in our earnings associated with the interest rate swap agreements 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
goodwill and other intangible assets are stated on the basis of cost 
the million in goodwill resulting from acquisitions made by us subsequent to june  was immediately subjected to the non amortization provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
see also impairment and recent accounting pronouncements which follows 
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires u s to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or when a possible impairment is indicated  using the fair value based test prescribed by sfas we performed our annual assessment of goodwill and determined that no impairmen t existed as of june  patents  licenses and trademarks 
patents  licenses and trademarks were primarily acquired through acquisitions accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
such assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their usefu l lives 
see note which follows for information on our identified intangibles 
estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the carrying value of long lived assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for potential litigation claims and settlements  potential liabilities related to tax filings in the ordinary cours e of business  and contract contingencies and obligations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under the asset and liability method specified thereunder  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax base s of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities are offset by deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
at december  and  certain of our non us subsidiaries have unremitted earnings of approximately million and million  respectively  on which we have not recorded a provision for united states federal income taxes since these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested 
such foreign earnings have been taxed according to the regulations existing in the countries in which they were earned 
impairment 
long lived assets including certain identifiable intangibles  and the goodwill related to those assets  are reviewed annually for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount o f the asset in question may not be recoverable including  but not limited to  a deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long lived assets  and when other changes occur which might impair recovery of long lived assets 
management reviewed the company s long lived assets and has taken an impairment charge of million in the year ended december   million in th e year ended december  and million in the year ended december  to reduce the carrying value of the services division to estimated realizable value 
the method used to determine the existence of an impairment would be discounted operating cash flows estimated over the remaining useful lives of the related long lived assets for continuing operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
impairment is measured as the difference between fair value and unamortized cost at the date impairment is determined 
discontinued operations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  a component classified as held for sale is reported in discontinued operations when the following conditions are met a the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and b the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction 
in a period in which a component of an entity either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale  the income statement for current and prior periods reports the results of operations of the component  including any estimated impairment gain or loss recognized in accordance with sfas paragraph  in discontinued operations 
the results of discontinued operations  less applicabl e income taxes benefit  is reported as a separate component of income before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes if applicable 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the asset and liability sections  respectively  of the statement of financial position 
comprehensive income and foreign currency translation 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas  assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into us dollars at the current rate of exchange existing at year end and revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates 
the cumulative translation adjustment  net of tax  which represents the effect of translating assets and liabilities of our foreign operations is  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and is classified as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the current year change in the accumulated amount  net of tax  is include d as a component of comprehensive income 
stock options and grants 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans  however it also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issue d to employees 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
under the intrinsic value based method  compensation costs is the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we have elected to continue to account for its employee stock compensation plans under apb opinion no 
with pro forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings per share  as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in sfas had been applied 
restricted stock awards are generally recorded as compensation expense over the vesting periods based on the market value on the date of grant 
if compensation cost for stock option grants had been determined based on the fair value on the grant dates for fiscal  and consistent with th e method prescribed by sfas  our net earnings and earnings per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousand s  except per share data net income loss as reported  deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards  net of related tax effects  add employee compensation expense for modification of stock option awards included in report net income  net of income taxes pro forma net income loss  earnings loss per share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma results of operations effective june   we decided to sell the armorgroup services division the sale was completed on november  through an organized and formal auction managed by outside advisors

cost of warranty revision 
in april  two class action lawsuits were filed against us in florida state court by police organizations and individual police officers  alleging  among other things  that our bullet resistant soft body armor vests manufactured and sold under the american body armor  safariland and protechtm brands  do not have the qualities and performance characteristics as warranted  thereby breaching express warranty  implied warranty of merchantability  implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose and duty to warn 
on august   we reached a preliminary settlement with respect t o the class action lawsuit filed in duval county  florida by the southern states police benevolent association southern states pba 
after fairness hearings were held  the florida circuit court gave final approval to that settlement on november  the other class action lawsuit filed against us by the national association of police organizations  inc napo  in lee county  florida  was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice on november  pursuant to the terms of the class action settlement with the southern states pba  the warranty on the american body armor xtreme zx r vest both nij threat level ii and iiia has been reduced from years to years 
in addition  every purchaser of an xtreme zx r vest has the option to exchange their vest for either a new zx r vest or any other vest of their choosing from the american body armor  safariland and protech tm product lines plus a transferable rebate coupon applicable towards their next purchase of a vest 
we have also made available on the american body armor website testing data  protocols and results relating to the testing of our vests 
we also continue to test all of our zylon r containing vests  and if such testing demonstrates tha t the tested vests fail to perform in accordance with their warranties  we will implement an exchange program for those models on a reasonably comparable basis to the american body armor xtreme zx r exchange program outlined above 
zylon r fiber is made by toyobo  a japanese corporation  and is a ballistic fiber widely used in the entire body armor industry 
a final report to the duva l county court regarding implementation of the settlement  exchange of vests and on going testing  will be filed on or before april  we are also voluntarily cooperating with a request received in december from the department of justice who is reviewing the entire industry s use of zylon r fiber in bullet resistant vests 
it should be stressed that our vests are certified by the national institute of justice  have never suffered any penetration in the field and continue to save lives and protect officers from injury 
in fact  neither of the two resolved class action lawsuits alleged personal injuries of any kind 
second chance body armor  one of our competitors in the bullet resistant market licenses from simula a certain patented technology which is used in some of the body armor it manufactures  but to our knowledge  no lawsuit has been brought against second chance based upon this licensed technology 
although simula may be impacted by the pending suits filed against second chance regarding its zylon r containing vests  the licensed technology is not specifically related to the use of zylon r fiber 
any adverse resolution of these matters  however  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity

the convertible notes will bear interest at a rate of per year  payable on november and may of each year beginning on may  and ending on november  the convertible notes will be subject to accretion of the principal amount beginnin g on november   at a rate that provides holders with an aggregate annual yield to maturity of  as defined in the agreement

on september   we entered into interest rate swap agreements  which have been designated as fair value hedges as defined under sfas with a notional amount totaling million 
the agreements were entered into to exchange the fixed interest rate on our notes for a variable interest rate equal to six month libor  set in arrears  plus a spread ranging from to fixed semi annually on the fifteenth day of february and august 
the agreements are subject to other terms and conditions common to transactions of this type 
in accordance with sfas  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swa p agreements offset changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in the market interest rate 
accordingly  other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  increased by  to million at december   from million at december   which reflected an increase in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
the corresponding increase in the hedge liability was recorded in long term debt 
the agreements are deemed to be a perfectly effective fair value hedge  and  therefore  qualify for the short cut method of accounting under sfas as a result  no ineffectiveness is expected to be recognized in our earnings associated with the interest rate swap agreements 
on august   we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of the notes

on march   we completed a registered exchange offer for the notes and exchanged the notes for new notes that were registered under the securities act of  as amended 
on august   in concert with our note offering  we entered into a new secured revolving credit facility the credit facility with bank of america  na  wachovia bank  national association and a syndicate of other financial institutions arranged by bank of america securities  llc 
the credit facility consists of a five year revolving credit facility  and  among other things  provides for i total maximum borrowings of million  ii a million sub limit for the issuances of standby and commercial letters of credit iii a million sub limit for swing line loans  and iv a million sub limit for multi currency borrowings

on january   we amended our credit facility to broaden our ability to make additional open market purchases of publicly traded securities subject to certain limitations 
on march   we amended our credit facility to allow us to pay dividends subject to certain limitations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our negative and affirmative covenants contained in the credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and the convertible notes 
in march  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to a maximum million shares of our common stock 
in february  the board of directors increased this stock repurchase program to authorize the repurchase  from time to time depending upon market conditions and other factors  of up to an additional million shares 
throug h february   we repurchased million shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program at an average price of per share  leaving u s with the ability to repurchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock 
repurchases may be made in the open market  in privately negotiated transactions utilizing various hedging mechanisms including  among others  the sale to third parties of put options for the company s common stock or otherwise 
at december   we had million shares of common stock outstanding 
we expect to continue our policy of repurchasing our common stock from time to time  subject to the restrictions contained in our credit facility  the indenture governing the notes and the indenture governing the convertible notes 
our credit facility permits us to repurchase shares of our common stock with no limitation if our ratio of consolidated senior indebtednes s to consolidated ebitda as such terms are defined in the credit facility for any rolling twelve month period is less than to when such ratio is greater than to  our credit facility limits our ability to repurchase shares at million 
this basket resets to each time the ratio is less than to as of december   such ratio was to our indentures governing the notes and the convertible notes also permit u s to repurchase shares of our common stock  subject to certain limitations  as long as we satisfy the conditions to such repurchase contained therein 
working capital for continuing operations was million and million as of december   and december   respectively 
the increase in working capital is largely a function of increases in cash from our october convertible note offering  our june equity offering  and increases in inventory of million and accounts receivable of million to support the growth in revenues from demand for the up armored hmmwv  supplemental armor for other military vehicles  and sapi plates 
our fiscal capital expenditures for continuing operations were million 
such expenditures included additional manufacturing and office space  and manufacturing machinery and equipment  leasehold improvements  information technology and communications infrastructure equipment 
we anticipate that the cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and available borrowings under the credit facility will enable us to meet liquidity working capital and capital expenditure requirements during the next months 
we may  however  require additional financing to pursue our strategy of growth through acquisitions and we are continuously exploring alternatives 
if such financing is required  there are no assurances that it will be available  or if available  that it can be obtained on terms favorable to us or on a basis that is not dilutive to our stockholders

off balance sheet arrangements on september   we entered into an off balance sheet leasing arrangement for an aircraft for company use

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in raw material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposure to changes in raw material prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financing activities 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our overall interest expense 
we do not utilize financial instruments fo r trading purposes 
market rate risk the following discussion about our market rate risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security price risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to borrowings under our notes  our credit facilities and our short term monetary investments 
to the extent that  from time to time  we hold short term money market instruments  there is a market rate risk for changes in interest rates on such instruments 
to that extent  there is inherent rollover risk in the short term money market instruments as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
however  there is no risk of loss of principal in the short term money market instruments  only a risk related to a potential reduction in future interest income 
on september   we entered into interest rate swap agreements in which we effectively exchanged the million fixed rate interest rate on the senior subordinated notes for variable rates in the notional amount of million  million and million at six month libor  set in arrears  plus   and  respectively 
the agreement involves receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the lives of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amount 
the variable interest rates are fixed semi annually on the fifteenth day of februar y and august 
the six month libor rate was on february  the maturity dates of the interest rate swap agreements match those of the underlying debt 
our objective for entering into these interest rate swaps was to reduce our exposure to changes in the fair value of the senior subordinated notes and to obtain variable rate financing at an attractive cost 
changes in the six month libor would affect our earnings either positively or negatively 
an assumed basis point increase in the six month libor would increase our interest obligations under the interest rate swaps by approximately  fo r a six month period 
in accordance with sfas  we designated the interest rate swap agreements as perfectly effective fair value hedges and  accordingly  use the short cut metho d of evaluating effectiveness 
as permitted by the short cut method  the change i n the fair value of the interest rate swaps will be reflected in earnings and an equivalent amount will be reflected as a change in the carrying value of the swaps  with an offset to earnings 
there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded 
on december   we recorded the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements of million and recorded the corresponding fair value adjustment to the notes in the other assets and long term debt sections of the consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these financial instruments 
however  counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions and the risk of loss due to nonperformance is considered by management to be minimal 
we do not hold or issue interest rate swap agreements or other derivative instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of our business is denominate d in us dollars 
there are costs associated with our operations in foreign countries that require payments in the local currency 
where appropriate and to partially manage our foreign currency risk related to those payments we receive payment from customers in local currencies in amounts sufficient to meet our local currency obligations 
we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge foreign currency risk 
risks associated with international operations we have invested substantial resources outside of the united states and plan to continue to do so in the future 
the armor mobile security division has investe d substantial resources in europe and south america 
these operations are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  tariffs and trade barriers  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  currency risks  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and local economic  political and social conditions 
governments of many developing countries have exercised and continue to exercis e substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector 
government actions in the future could have a significant adverse effect on economic conditions in a developing country or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on us and our operating companies 
we do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we currently conduct business 
moreover  applicable agreements relating to our interests in our operating companies are frequently governed by foreign law 
as a result  in the event of a dispute  it may be difficult for us to enforce our rights 
accordingly  we may have little or no recourse upon the occurrence of any of these developments
