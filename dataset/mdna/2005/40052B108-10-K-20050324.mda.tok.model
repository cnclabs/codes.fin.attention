item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under additional factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview gtx is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutics primarily related to the treatment of serious men s health conditions and oncology 
our lead drug discovery and development programs are focused on small molecules that selectively modulate the effects of estrogens and androgens  two essential classes of hormones 
we have four clinical programs 
we are developing acapodene for two clinical programs in men a pivotal phase iii clinical trial for the prevention of prostate 
table of contents cancer in high risk men and a pivotal phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of serious side effects of androgen deprivation therapy adt for advanced prostate cancer 
in our third clinical program  together with our partner ortho biotech  we are developing andarine  a sarm  which we are working with our partner to progress to phase ii clinical testing in the second half of this year 
in our fourth clinical program  we are developing our second sarm  ostarine  for andropause and other chronic conditions related to aging  including sarcopenia 
we have an extensive preclinical pipeline generated from our own discovery program which has focused on research and development efforts of serm and sarm compounds  other receptor modulator compounds and viral cytolytics 
two specific product candidates developed as a result of our discovery efforts include prostarine  a sarm for bph  and andromustine  an anti cancer drug for hormone refractory prostate cancer 
we acquired the rights to distribute fareston in the us from orion in december we plan to build a small  highly focused  specialty sales and marketing infrastructure  which we expect to include to sales representatives  to market acapodene to the relatively small and concentrated community of urologists and medical oncologists and fareston prescribers  principally medical oncologists  in the united states and to market andarine to urologists in the united states 
on february   we successfully completed an ipo of  shares of common stock at an offering price to the public of per share resulting in net proceeds of million 
upon the closing of the ipo  all outstanding shares of preferred stock  and accrued dividends thereon  were converted into  shares of common stock 
in march  we entered into a joint collaboration and license agreement with ortho biotech for andarine and specified backup sarm compounds 
under the terms of the agreement  we received in april an up front licensing fee and reimbursement of development expenses of million 
the up front licensing fee and reimbursement of development expenses are expected to be amortized into revenue on a straight line basis through march additionally  we will receive licensing fees and milestone payments of up to million based on andarine and up to million for each additional licensed compound achieving specific clinical development decisions or obtaining regulatory approvals 
all milestone payments are based on achievements prior to the commercial launch of andarine 
johnson johnson pharmaceutical research development will be responsible for further clinical development and related expenses for andarine and other licensed sarm compounds 
ortho biotech will be responsible for commercialization and related expenses for andarine and other licensed sarm compounds 
if andarine is approved for commercial sale  ortho biotech will exclusively market andarine in the united states and in markets outside the united states 
under the agreement  we have the option to co promote andarine and the other licensed sarm compounds to urologists in the united states for indications specifically related to men s health 
we will receive up to double digit royalties on all united states and worldwide sales plus additional royalty payments in excess of on all co promoted sales generated from urologists in the united states 
in december  we purchased from orion all remaining rights to toremifene in the us and additional rights in all other countries giving us exclusive global rights to all toremifene based products for all indications in humans  except breast cancer outside of the us toremifene is the active component in acapodene and fareston  which has been approved by the fda for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer 
under the terms of our purchase agreement with orion  we were required to pay orion a license fee of million and to purchase fareston inventory of approximately  we will continue to market fareston in the us for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and will pay a royalty to orion on fareston sales 
the royalty rate for fareston will be reduced after we commercialize a new toremifene based product such as acapodene for men s health indications 
additionally  as part of our acquisition agreement with orion  our license and supply agreement with orion has been amended to provide that orion will manufacture and supply all of our needs for clinical trial and commercial grade material for toremifene based product developed and marketed globally by us  including acapodene and fareston 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the 
table of contents reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition  income taxes  intangible assets  long term service contracts and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report  we believe that the following accounting policies are most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we use revenue recognition criteria outlined in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
accordingly  revenues from licensing agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the agreement 
non refundable up front fees  where we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligation  are generally recorded as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and amortized into license fees in the statement of operations over the term of the performance obligation 
we estimated the performance obligation period to be five years for the development of andarine 
the factors that drive the actual development period of a pharmaceutical product are inherently uncertain  and include determining the timing and expected costs to complete the project  projecting regulatory approvals and anticipating potential delays 
we use all of these factors in initially estimating the economic useful lives of our performance obligations  and we also continuously monitor these factors for indications of appropriate revisions 
revenues derived from reimbursements of costs associated with the development of andarine are recorded in compliance with eitf issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
according to the criteria established by this eitf issue  in transactions where we act as a principal  have discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and perform part of the services required in the transaction  we have met the criteria to record revenue for the gross amount of the reimbursements 
research and development costs we expense research and development costs in the period in which they are incurred 
these costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with specific projects as well as fees paid to various entities that perform research and clinical trial studies on our behalf 
patent costs we expense patent costs  including legal expenses  in the period in which they are incurred 
patent expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations 
preferred stock redemption value our preferred stock was recorded at its redemption value 
the per share redemption price was equal to the greater of liquidation value  which included accrued dividends  or the fair value calculated on an as if converted to common stock basis 
we determine a redemption value fair value considering factors such as the share price of preferred stock issuances  achievement of significant milestones in clinical trials and general market conditions 
at december   the per share redemption value was determined based on the estimated projected midpoint on the range of our initial public offering price per common share 
the changes in redemption value affect the loss attributable to common stockholders 

table of contents deferred stock compensation in anticipation of our ipo on february   we determined that  for financial reporting purposes  the estimated value of our common stock was in excess of the exercise price for stock options issued to employees from june  to december  accordingly  we recorded non cash deferred stock based compensation expense of million in  and are amortizing the related expense over the service period  which is generally five years 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to employees has been determined as the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date such options were granted and the applicable exercise price 
such amount is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized on the straight line basis 
income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this valuation allowance is estimated by management based on our projected future taxable income 
the estimate of future taxable income is highly subjective 
we have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future 
however  these assumptions may be inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur in the future 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
at december   net of the valuation allowance  the net deferred tax assets were reduced to zero 
purchased intangible assets we account for our purchased intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that purchased intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their estimated economic lives 
our purchased intangible asset  license fee  represents a license fee paid to orion in connection with entering into an amended and restated license and supply agreement 
the license fee is being amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement which we estimate to be years 
other purchased intangible assets represent the costs incurred to acquire software used by us 
we amortize the cost of purchased software on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software  generally three years 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value our license fee 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk and the cost of capital 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the license fee 
we review our license fee for impairment on a periodic basis using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of our license fee are less than its carrying value  it is written down to the discounted cash flow value 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining regulatory approval for acapodene  we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our license fee 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values in the first interim or annual period beginning after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods 
table of contents presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas research and development since our inception  we have been focused on drug discovery and development programs 
research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses for year ended december  and of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  research and development expenses include our expenses for personnel associated with our research activities  screening and identification of product candidates  formulation and synthesis activities  manufacturing  preclinical studies  including toxicology studies  clinical trials  regulatory affairs  and quality assurance activities 
the following table identifies for each of our product candidates  the development phase  the status  and research and development expense for each product candidate as well as information pertaining to our other research and development efforts for each of the periods presented 
research and development spending for past periods is not indicative of spending in future periods

moreover  because of uncertainties inherent in drug discovery and development  including those factors described in the additional factors that may affect future results section of this annual report on form k  we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize any of the product candidates included in the table above 
drug development in the united states is a process that includes several steps defined by the fda 
the fda approval process for a new drug involves completion of preclinical studies and the submission of the results of these studies to the fda  together with proposed clinical protocols  manufacturing information  analytical data and other information in an investigational new drug application  or ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii and iii 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii clinical trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after completion of clinical trials  a new drug application  or nda  may be submitted to the fda 
in responding to an nda  the fda may refuse to file the application  or if accepted for filing  the fda may not grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  future clinical trial results  
table of contents the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
any failure to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so  are set forth in the additional factors that may affect future results section of this annual report on form k 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving executive  finance  legal  human resources  information technology  public relations and marketing functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense and professional fees for legal  accounting  public relations and marketing services 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as we add personnel  facilities including our office space expansion  and infrastructure to support the planned growth of our business as well as additional expenses associated with operating as a public company 
in addition  we plan to expand our sales and marketing efforts which will result in increased sales and marketing expenses in future years 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  collaboration revenue 
we recognized collaboration revenue for the year ended december  of million 
collaboration revenue included million from the amortization of the up front license fee received in april in connection with our collaboration and license agreement with ortho biotech products  lp in addition  collaboration revenue included  from the reimbursement of andarine development costs under our collaboration and license agreement 
no revenue was recognized for the year ended december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in research and development expenses included increased expenditures of approximately million related to a pivotal phase iii clinical trial of acapodene for the treatment of side effects of androgen deprivation therapy 
in addition  we incurred additional expenses of approximately million related to the preclinical development of ostarine and approximately million on other research and development efforts 
these increases were offset by a reduction in clinical trial expenses for the phase iib clinical trial of acapodene for the prevention of prostate cancer in men with high grade pin which was completed in the second quarter of of approximately  and a reduction in research and development spending on andarine of approximately million 
research and development expenses included amortization of non cash stock based compensation expense of  
table of contents we expect that research and development expenditures will continue to increase substantially in future years due to the continuation of the pivotal phase iii clinical trial of acapodene for the treatment of serious side effects of androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer  the continuation of a pivotal phase iii clinical trial of acapodene for the prevention of prostate cancer in men with high grade pin  the continued clinical and preclinical development of other product candidates in the company s sarm program that are not included in our collaboration with ortho biotech  including ostarine and prostarine  the continued preclinical development of other product candidates including andromustine  the increase in research and development personnel  the planned expansion of office and lab space in our corporate headquarters and prelaunch educational activities 
under the terms of our collaboration with ortho biotech  johnson johnson pharmaceutical research and development will be responsible for future clinical development and expenses of andarine 
we expect to expand the scope of our drug discovery and development programs in future periods  which may result in substantial increases in research and development expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses  insurance costs  intellectual property related expenses  marketing and investor relations costs  professional fees and other administrative costs to support the planned growth of our business  as well as additional expenses associated with operating as a public company 
interest income 
interest income increased to approximately  for the year ended december  from approximately  for the year ended december  the increase was the result of higher average cash and cash equivalents balances during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year as a result of the ipo net proceeds of approximately million and million received as an up front milestone payment from ortho biotech 
adjustment to preferred stock redemption value 
our preferred stock was recorded at its redemption value 
the per share redemption price was equal to the greater of liquidation value  which included accrued dividends  or the fair value calculated on an as if converted to common stock basis 
at december   the per share redemption value was determined based on the estimated projected midpoint of the range of our initial public offering price per common share of approximately per share 
at february   the date of the closing of the company s ipo and automatic conversion of all outstanding preferred stock  and accrued dividends thereon  into common stock  the market price for our common stock was per share 
prior to conversion into common stock  the carrying value of the preferred stock and accrued dividends was adjusted to reflect the per share redemption value on the date of conversion resulting in a decrease in the carrying value of preferred stock of million and an offsetting decrease in net loss attributable to common stockholders 
the adjustment to the preferred stock redemption value for the year ended december  was an increase of million with an offsetting increase to net loss attributable to common stockholders 
the increase in the redemption value for the year ended december  was the result of the achievement of significant milestones and clinical trials  general market conditions  and was made in connection with our anticipated initial public offering 
comparison of years ended december  and december  research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expenses for the year ended december  included amortization of non cash stock based compensation expense of  the increases in research and development expenses included increased expenditures of approximately  related to two phase ii clinical trials and the preparation for and initiation of a pivotal phase iii clinical trial of acapodene for the treatment of side effects of androgen deprivation therapy 
in addition  we incurred additional expenses of approximately  related to the completion of phase i clinical trials for andarine and the continued development of andarine and other product candidates in our sarm program 
these increases were offset by a reduction in clinical trial expenses for the phase iib clinical trial of acapodene for the reduction in the incidence of prostate cancer in men with high grade pin of approximately  and a reduction in research and development spending on other product candidates of approximately  
table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses of approximately  and an increase in professional fees of approximately  the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included amortization of non cash stock based compensation expense of interest income 
interest income decreased to approximately  for the year ended december  from approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease was the result of a decrease in the average cash and cash equivalents balance and overall interest rates 
adjustment to preferred stock redemption value 
the adjustment to preferred stock redemption value consists of the amount of the change in the redemption value  which is the greater of the liquidation value or fair value  of the preferred stock 
the adjustment for the year ended december  was an increase of million  or per share  as compared to an increase of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the per share redemption value was as of december   as of december  and as of december  the increase in the redemption values for the years ended december  and were the result of the achievement of significant milestones in clinical trials and general market conditions

see critical accounting policies preferred stock redemption value 
liquidity and capital resources through december   we have financed our operations and internal growth almost exclusively through private placements of preferred stock and with the proceeds of our ipo 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception in as we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development  including our clinical trials 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  of which million related to non cash dividends and adjustments to the preferred stock redemption value 
our accumulated deficit resulted primarily from our research and development activities associated with acapodene for the prevention of prostate cancer in men with high grade pin  including our phase iib clinical trial and an ongoing pivotal phase iii clinical trial  acapodene for the treatment of side effects of androgen deprivation therapy  including two phase ii clinical trials and an ongoing pivotal phase iii clinical trial  andarine for the treatment of cachexia from various forms of cancer  including preclinical development  manufacturing and formulation  and four phase i clinical trials  preclinical development of ostarine which is being developed for the treatment of andropause  and our other research and development efforts  general and administrative expenses  and non cash dividends and adjustments to the preferred stock redemption value of million related to our cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock 
see critical accounting policies preferred stock redemption value 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over the next several years as we continue our clinical development and research and development activities  apply for regulatory approvals  expand our sales and marketing capabilities and grow our operations 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  on february   we successfully completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock at an offering price to the public of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the use of cash in all periods resulted primarily from funding our 
table of contents net losses 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was reduced by the up front license fee and reimbursement of development expenses in connection with our collaboration with ortho biotech which is being amortized as income over the development period 
cash requirements for operating activities are expected to increase in future periods  due in part to significant costs related to the continuation of two pivotal phase iii clinical trials for acapodene as well as the clinical and preclinical development of our other product candidates 
net cash used in investing activities was million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the use of cash in all periods was primarily for the purchase of research and development equipment and office equipment and the purchase of an intangible asset license fee in we currently expect to make expenditures for capital equipment and leasehold improvements of up to million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities  was million excluding approximately million of ipo related expenses paid in  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  reflected net proceeds from the company s ipo  which closed february   less underwriters commission and offering expenses paid during the period 
net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and reflected the net proceeds received from the issuance of preferred stock 
we believe that our current cash resources  interest on these funds and product revenue from the sale of fareston  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least the end of this estimate does not include payments that we may receive as milestone payments under our joint collaboration and license agreement with ortho biotech 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our projected operating requirements is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the additional factors that may affect future results section of this annual report 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates and other research and development activities  including risks and uncertainties that could impact the rate of progress of our development activities  we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials and other research and development activities 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the achievement of certain milestone events under our joint collaboration and license agreement with ortho biotech  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  
table of contents the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue  we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  such as our arrangement with ortho biotech  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances and revenues from the sale of fareston 
with the exception of payments that we may receive under our collaboration with ortho biotech  we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  such as our arrangement with ortho biotech  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
we have no long term debt 
at december   we had contractual obligations as follows payment due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total our long term commitments under the operating lease shown above consist of payments relating to a lease for laboratory and office space at north dunlap street  memphis  tennessee 
this lease expires on september  this lease is terminable by either party on days notice 
the table above excludes contingent payments under the license agreements to which we are a party 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash equivalents on deposit in highly liquid money market funds 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
the effect of a hypothetical change in all interest rates on our investments would result in a change in interest income of for the year ended december  we operate primarily in the united states 
through december   we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will increase because we are obligated to pay orion corporation  our supplier of acapodene and fareston  in euros  however such exposure is not expected to be material
