these agreements usually provide for nonexclusive distribution rights and pertain to specific geographic territories 
the agreements are also generally short term  subject to periodic renewal  and often contain provisions permitting termination by either our supplier or us without cause upon relatively short notice 
an oem supplier that elects to terminate a distribution agreement will generally repurchase its products carried in our inventory 
our it distribution and assembly business subjects us to the risk that the value of our inventory will be affected adversely by suppliers price reductions or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the products comprising our inventory 
many of our oem suppliers offer us limited protection from the loss in value of our inventory due to technological change or a supplier s price reductions 
under many of these agreements  we have a limited period of time to return or exchange products or claim price protection credits 
we monitor our inventory levels and attempt to time our purchases to maximize our protection under supplier programs 
our oem suppliers generally warrant the products we distribute and allow returns of defective products  including those returned to us by our reseller customers 
we generally do not independently warrant the products we distribute  however  we warrant our services with regard to products that we configure for our reseller customers  and the products that we assemble from components purchased from other sources

joint design and manufacturing services 
we offer contract design and manufacturing services to oems through our relationship with our largest indirect stockholder  mitac international

table of contents sales and marketing as of november   we employed sales and marketing professionals 
we serve our large government and commercial reseller customers through dedicated sales professionals 
we market to smaller resellers through dedicated regional sales teams 
in addition  we have dedicated product marketing and sales specialists that focus on the sale and promotion of the products of selected suppliers 
these specialists are also directly involved in establishing new relationships with leading oems and resellers 
our sales and marketing professionals are complemented by members of our executive management team who are integral in identifying potential new customer opportunities and ensuring customer satisfaction 
we have sales offices in north and latin america and asia and attempt to locate our sales and marketing professionals in close proximity to our reseller customers 
we also have a sales team dedicated to cultivating new contract assembly opportunities with it product oems 
on selected opportunities  this team works with mitac international representatives to offer oems comprehensive outsourced supply chain solutions 
this joint sales effort enables us to deliver complete design to delivery solutions for our oem customers 
our operations distribution we operate distribution facilities in the united states  canada  china  japan and mexico 
our distribution processes are highly automated to reduce errors  ensure timely order fulfillment and enhance the efficiency of our warehouse operations and back office administration 
in the united states  we operate ten distribution facilities that are geographically dispersed to be near end users 
this regional strategy enables us to benefit from lower shipping costs and shorter delivery lead times to our customers 
furthermore  we track several performance measurements to continuously improve the efficiency and accuracy of our distribution operations 
our regional locations also enable us to make local deliveries and provide will call fulfillment to more customers than if our distribution operations were centralized resulting in better service to our customers 
our workforce is comprised of permanent and temporary employees  enabling us to respond to short term changes in order activity 
our proprietary it systems and processes  along with technology solutions from leading warehouse automation providers  enable us to automate many of our distribution operations 
for example  we use radio frequency and bar code scanning technologies in all of our warehouse operations to maintain real time inventory records  facilitate frequent cycle counts and improve the accuracy of order fulfillment 
we use palm readers to capture real time labor cost data enabling efficient management of our daily labor costs 
we also scan and archive receiving documents and generate electronic freight out vouchers to streamline our accounts payable administration 
to enhance the accuracy of our order fulfillment and protect our inventory from shrinkage  our systems also incorporate numerous controls 
these controls include order weight checks  bar code scanning  and serial number profile verification to verify that the product shipped matches the customer order 
we also use digital video imaging to record our small package shipping activities by order 
these images and other warehouse and shipping data are available online to our customer service representatives enabling us to quickly respond to order inquiries by our customers 
contract assembly we operate our principal assembly facilities in the united states and the united kingdom 
in our contract assembly business  we source materials  assemble it systems  and ship completed products on behalf of our oem customers 
we generally assemble it systems  including personal computers  workstations and servers  
table of contents incorporating system components from our distribution inventory and other sources 
additionally  we perform production value added services  including kitting  asset tagging  hard drive imaging and reconfiguration 
our contract assembly facilities are iso certified 
we focus on system level contract assembly rather than full service manufacturing in order to minimize our capital investments in our assembly business 
because of the variability of our assembly orders  our workforce is predominantly comprised of temporary workers 
we also partner with mitac international to provide certain manufacturing capabilities  including design and printed circuit board assembly as these activities require extensive capital investments and labor 
international operations approximately and of our total revenue for fiscal and  respectively  originated outside of the united states 
a key element in our business strategy has been to expand our global presence in order to provide our distribution and contract assembly capabilities to oems in locations that meet their regional requirements 
consistent with this strategy  we have established international operations in canada  china  japan  mexico and the united kingdom 
purchasing product costs represent our single largest expense and it product inventory is one of our largest working capital investments 
furthermore  product procurement from our oem suppliers is a highly complex process that involves marketing incentive programs  rebate programs  price protection  volume and early payment discounts and other arrangements 
consequently  efficient and effective purchasing operations are critical to our success 
our purchasing group works closely with many areas of our organization  especially our product managers who work closely with our oem suppliers and our sales force  to understand the volume and mix of it products that should be purchased 
in addition  the purchasing group utilizes an internally developed  proprietary information systems application tool  which further aids the purchasing group in forecasting future product demand based on several factors  including past sales levels  expected product life cycle and current and projected economic conditions 
our information systems tool also tracks warehouse and channel inventory levels and open purchase orders on a real time basis enabling us to stock inventory at a regional level closer to the customer as well as to actively manage our working capital resources 
this level of automation allows for greater efficiencies of inventory management by replenishing and turning inventory  as well as placing purchase orders  on a more frequent basis 
furthermore  our systems tool also allows for automated checks and controls to prevent the generation of inaccurate orders 
the purchasing group is supported by employees based in china  who handle daily back office routine functions such as purchase order issuance  changes to purchase orders and returns 
having a purchasing support team in china allows us to benefit from highly skilled and lower cost labor 
managing our oem supplier incentive programs is another critical function of our purchasing group 
we attempt to maximize the benefit of incentives  rebates and volume and early payment discounts that our oem suppliers offer us from time to time 
we carefully evaluate these purchasing benefits relative to our product handling and carrying costs so that we do not over invest in our inventory 
we also closely monitor inventory levels on a product by product basis and plan purchases to take advantage of oem supplier provided price protection 
by managing inventory levels at each of our regional distribution facilities  we can minimize our shipping costs by stocking products near to our resellers and their end user customers 
financial services we offer various credit terms to our customers as well as prepayment  credit card and cash on delivery terms 
we also collect outstanding accounts receivable on behalf of our reseller customers in certain markets 
in 
table of contents issuing credit to our reseller customers  we closely and continually monitor their credit worthiness through our information systems  which contain detailed information on each customer s payment history  as well as through periodic detailed credit file reviews by our financial services staff 
in addition  we participate in a north american credit association whose members exchange customer credit rating information 
we have also purchased credit insurance in some geographies to further control credit risks 
finally  we establish reserves for estimated credit losses in the normal course of business 
we also sell to certain reseller customers where the transactions are financed by a third party floor plan financing company 
the expenses charged by these financing companies are generally paid by us 
we generally receive payment from these financing institutions within days from the date of sale  depending on the specific arrangement 
information technology our it systems manage the entire order cycle  including processing customer orders  production planning  customer billing and payment tracking 
these internally developed it systems make our distribution and contract assembly operations more efficient and provide visibility into all aspects of our operations 
we believe our it infrastructure is scalable to support further growth 
the continuing enhancement of our it systems facilitates improved product and inventory management  streamlines order and delivery processes  and increases operational flexibility 
having a common enterprise resource planning platform allows us to quickly respond to fluctuations in our customers orders in different parts of the world and facilitates simultaneous product introduction in multiple regions while providing visibility into product availability 
to allow our customers and suppliers to communicate and transact business with us in an efficient and consistent manner  we have implemented a mix of proprietary and off the shelf software programs  which integrate our it systems with those of our customers and suppliers 
in particular  we maintain edi and web based communication links with many of our reseller customers to enable them to search for products  check real time price  inventory availability and specifications  place and track orders  receive invoices and process returns 
we plan to continue making significant investments in our it systems to facilitate the flow of information  increase our efficiency and lower transaction costs 
competition we operate in a highly competitive environment  both in the united states and internationally 
the it product distribution and contract assembly industries are characterized by intense competition  based primarily on product availability  credit availability  price  speed of delivery  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  quality and depth of product lines  pre sale and post sale technical support  flexibility and timely response to design changes  technological capabilities  product quality  service and support 
we compete with a variety of regional  national and international it product distributors and contract manufacturers 
our current major competitors in it product distribution include bell microproducts  ingram micro and tech data and  to a lesser extent  regional distributors 
we also face competition from our oem suppliers  which also sell directly to resellers and end users 
the distribution industry has recently undergone  and continues to undergo  major consolidation 
during this period  a number of significant players within the it distribution industry exited or merged with other players within the distribution market 
we have participated in this consolidation through our acquisitions of merisel canada  gates arrow and emj data systems limited  and we are continuing to evaluate other opportunities 
our current competitors in contract assembly include benchmark electronics  celestica  foxconn  sanmina sci and solectron 
we also face competition from the manufacturing and assembly operations of our current and potential customers  which continually evaluate the relative benefits of internal manufacturing and assembly compared to outsourcing 

table of contents many of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial  operating  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
some of our competitors may have broader geographic breadth and range of services than us and may have more developed relationships with their existing customers 
we attempt to offset our scale disadvantage by focusing on a limited number of leading oems to represent  running the most efficient and low cost operation possible and offering a high level of customer service 
employees as of november   we had  full time employees  including in sales and marketing  in distribution and assembly operations  and in executive  finance  it and administration 
given the variability in our business and the quick response time required by customers  it is critical that we are able to rapidly ramp up and ramp down our production capabilities to maximize efficiency 
as a result  we frequently use a significant number of temporary or contract workers  which totaled approximately at november  our employees are not represented by a labor union nor are they covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our employee relations to be good

on august   the trustees of the bankruptcy estate of qps  inc filed a bankruptcy preference action in the united states bankruptcy court for the central district of california against us 
these preference actions are filed by the trustee of the bankruptcy estate on behalf of the bankrupt entity s debtors and generally seek to have payments made by the bankrupt entity within days prior to the bankruptcy returned to the bankruptcy estate for allocation among all of the bankrupt entity s creditors 
the amounts sought to be returned in the various preference actions range from  to  in the majority of the actions  limited discovery has taken place and some trial dates have been set 
we believe that the outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may not be successful in defending these or other claims 
regardless of the outcome  litigation can result in substantial expense and could divert the efforts of our management

shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
our distribution sales are made to reseller customers on a purchase order basis and generally relate to a specific order from a reseller s end user customer 
our contract assembly sales are generated from specific purchase orders received from our oem customers for a specified unit quantity 
we do not have long term sales agreements with our reseller or contract assembly customers 
revenue from our distribution business represented  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
in our distribution business  our primary customers are resellers 
none of our reseller customers accounted for more than of our total revenue in fiscal  or approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  was derived from the sale of hp products 
most of our remaining revenue is derived from the distribution and assembly of the it products of a relatively small number of other suppliers 
approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  was derived from our contract assembly business 
we provide contract assembly primarily to it product oems 
our contract assembly revenue is dependent on a small number of customers 
revenue from contract assembly provided to sun microsystems accounted for less than of our total revenue in fiscal and and approximately of our total revenue in fiscal no other customer accounted for more than of total revenue in fiscal the market for it products is generally characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles 
our distribution business is also highly competitive on the basis of price 
we set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product or bundle of products we distribute 
from time to time  we also participate in the incentive and rebate programs of our oem suppliers 
these programs are important determinants of the final sales price we charge to our reseller customers 
to mitigate the risk of declining prices and obsolescence of our distribution inventory  our oem suppliers generally offer us limited price protection and return rights for products that are marked down or discontinued by them 
we carefully manage our inventory to maximize the benefit to us of these supplier provided protections 
a significant portion of our cost of distribution revenue is the purchase price we pay our oem suppliers for the products we sell  net of any rebates and purchase discounts received from our oem suppliers 
cost of distribution revenue also consists of provisions for inventory losses and write downs  and freight expenses associated with the receipt in and shipment out of our inventory 
our contract assembly cost of revenue consists primarily of cost of materials  labor and overhead 
margins the it product distribution and contract assembly industries in which we operate are characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue  or operating margin 
our gross margin has fluctuated between and annually over the past five years due to the mix of products  customers  seasonality and the general economic environment 
increased competition arising from industry consolidation and low demand for it products may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margin 
generally  when our revenue becomes more concentrated on limited products or customers  our gross margin tends to decrease due to increased pricing pressure from oem suppliers or reseller customers 
our operating margin has also fluctuated between and annually over the past five years  based primarily on our ability to achieve economies of scale  the management of our operating expenses  the relative mix of our distribution and contract assembly revenue and the timing of our acquisitions and investments 
recent acquisitions we seek to augment our organic growth with strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement and expand our supply chain service capabilities 
our historical acquisitions have brought us new 
table of contents reseller customers and oem suppliers  extended the geographic reach of our operations  particularly in international markets  and expanded the services we provide to our oem suppliers and customers 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and include acquired entities within our consolidated financial statements from the closing date of the acquisition 
the following lists our largest acquisitions completed in the fiscal years ended november   and emj data systems  limited 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the outstanding common stock of emj data systems limited emj  a publicly traded canadian company on the toronto stock exchange  for cash of approximately million 
emj is a distributor of computer products and peripherals 
we acquired emj to diversify our offerings and to further expand our distribution market share in north america  primarily in canada 
gates arrow distributing 
on may   we acquired substantially all of the net working capital assets  approximately million  of gates arrow distributing  a business unit of arrow electronics  inc  for approximately million 
gates arrow was a full line it product distributor serving value added resellers across north america and was located in greenville  south carolina 
the gates arrow acquisition further expanded our distribution market share in north america  increased the number of oem software publishers we distribute for and also increased the number of value added enterprise level resellers we serve 
economic and industry trends our revenue is highly dependent on the end market demand for the it products that we distribute and assemble 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it products and overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it distribution industry and increased price based competition 
investments in the past we have made investments in an attempt to expand our offerings and to capitalize on industry trends 
at november   we did not hold any significant equity investments and we did not have any significant equity investment activity during the fiscal years ended november   or deferred compensation plan we have a deferred compensation plan for a limited number of our directors and employees 
we maintain a liability on our balance sheet for salary and bonus amounts deferred by participants and we accrue interest expense on unpaid amounts 
interest expense on the deferred amounts is classified in interest expenses  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
the plan allows for the participants to direct investment of deferred amounts in equity securities 
these equity investments are classified as trading securities 
generally accepted accounting principles require that gains losses on the deferred compensation equity securities be recorded in other income expense  net and that an equal amount be charged or credited if losses to selling  general and administrative expenses relating to compensation amounts which are payable to the plan participants 
deferred compensation expense was  in fiscal and  in fiscal and a credit of  in fiscal unearned stock based compensation in prior years  in connection with the granting of employee stock options that had exercise prices determined to be below fair market value on the date of grant  we have recorded unearned stock based compensation 
unearned stock based compensation represents the difference between the fair market value of 
table of contents our common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date of grant and the exercise price of these options 
unearned stock based compensation is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options  generally five years  using the straight line method 
our stock based compensation expense relates to stock options granted to individuals and is reflected in cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses 
at november   the stock based compensation was fully amortized 
seasonality our operating results are affected by the seasonality of the it products industry 
we have historically experienced higher sales in our fourth fiscal quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting  federal government spending and purchasing cycles of our customers and end users 
these patterns may not be repeated in subsequent periods 
insurance coverage although from time to time we have experienced incidents of theft at various facilities  in fiscal we experienced theft as a result of break ins at three of our warehouses in which approximately million of inventory was stolen 
based on our investigation  discussions with local law enforcement and meetings with federal authorities  we believe the thefts at our warehouses were part of an organized crime effort that targeted a number of technology equipment warehouses throughout the united states 
as a result of the loss  we reduced our inventory value by million  and recorded estimated proceeds  net of deductibles as a receivable from our insurance company  included within other current assets on our balance sheet as of november  in january we received a final settlement from our insurance company  which amounted to substantially all of the receivable recorded as of november  these types of incidents may make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain theft coverage in the future 
there is no assurance that future incidents of theft will not re occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussions and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we review and evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that relate to accounts receivable  vendor programs  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets and other long lived assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
our estimates are based on our historical experience and a variety of other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making our judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our judgment  estimates and or assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts on our accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  which may result in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in estimating our allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of our receivable portfolio  the existence of a limited amount of credit insurance  our continuing credit evaluation of our customers financial conditions and collateral requirements from our customers in certain circumstances 

table of contents oem supplier programs 
we receive funds from oem suppliers for inventory price protection  product rebates  marketing and infrastructure reimbursement  and promotion programs 
inventory price protection and product rebates are recorded as a reduction of cost of revenue 
marketing  infrastructure and promotion programs are recorded  net of direct costs  in selling  general and administrative expense 
any excess funds associated with these programs are recorded in cost of revenue 
we accrue rebates based on the terms of the program and sales of qualifying products 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
amounts received or receivable from oem suppliers that are not yet earned are deferred on our balance sheet 
actual rebates may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued 
in addition  if market conditions were to deteriorate due to an economic downturn  oem suppliers may change the terms of some or all of these programs or cease them altogether 
any such change could lower our gross margins on products we sell or revenue earned 
we also provide reserves for receivables on oem supplier programs for estimated losses resulting from oem suppliers inability to pay  or rejections of such claims by oem suppliers 
inventories 
our inventory levels are based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can cause us to have excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
these write downs are reflected in our cost of revenue 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
our estimates are influenced by the following considerations sudden decline in demand due to economic downturns  rapid product improvements and technological changes  our ability to return to oem suppliers a certain percentage of our purchases  and protection from loss in value of inventory under our oem supplier agreements 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we assess potential impairment of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely 
we also assess potential impairment of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets on an annual basis 
if indicators of impairment were present in intangible assets used in operations and future cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified 
the amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
factors we consider important  which may cause an impairment include significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset  negative industry or economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we have to estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we have to provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
contingencies and litigation 
there are various claims  lawsuits and pending actions against us incident to our operations 
if a loss arising from these actions is probable and can be reasonably estimated  we record the amount of the loss  or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range within which no point is more probable than another 
based on current available information  we believe that the ultimate 
table of contents resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as additional information becomes available  we assess any potential liability related to these actions and may need to revise our estimates 
future revisions of our estimates could materially impact the results of our operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the indicated periods  data as percentages of revenue fiscal years ending november  statements of operations data revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense  net other income expense  net income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest in subsidiaries net income fiscal years ended november  and revenue 
year ended november  year ended november  change in thousands in thousands revenue distribution revenue contract assembly revenue the increase in our distribution revenue was primarily attributable to market share increases  increased demand for products through the it distribution channel  primarily in north america  and the acquisition of emj data systems limited in september  which contributed approximately million in revenue in fiscal our market share increases were a result of our increased selling efforts  including a increase in sales staff in the united states  and overall improved service offerings  including inventory availability  financing and marketing 
the increase in our distribution revenue was somewhat mitigated by continued significant competition in the it distribution marketplace and gradual declines in the average selling price of products we sell 
although the overall demand for it products  including the sale of products through the it distribution channel  has improved over the past two years  there can be no assurance that it will continue to improve or that our suppliers will not change their marketing and sales strategies and decrease their business through the it distribution channel 
while we continue to address these challenges to our revenue growth  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing the effects of these issues on our future results 
the increase in contract assembly revenue was the result of an increase in products we assemble for our primary oem customer  sun microsystems  as well as sales to new customers 
we currently expect our assembly business revenue level to have seasonal fluctuations in the foreseeable quarters  but we currently do not anticipate increases and decreases in revenues as significant as we have experienced over the past two years 

table of contents gross profit 
year ended november  year ended november  change in thousands in thousands gross profit percentage of revenue our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the mix and average selling prices of products we sell and the mix of customers to whom we sell  rebate and discount programs from our suppliers  freight costs and reserves for inventory losses 
the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily a result of lower margins in our distribution segment 
distribution gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to customer mix  as sales volumes to larger customers  which generally carry lower margins due to competitive and volume reasons  increased 
our contract assembly gross margin percentage also decreased due to our overall increased business over the prior year and the associated product and customer mix 
while we currently expect that our total gross margin percentage will be relatively stable from fiscal levels  our gross margins may decrease further in future periods as a result of the relative mix of our distribution and contract assembly revenue  distribution customer mix  as well as due to potential increased competition  softness in the overall economy or changes to the terms and conditions in which we do business with our oems 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
year ended november  year ended november  change in thousands in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of revenue our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  bonuses  and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  product marketing  distribution and contract assembly operations and administration 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include stock based compensation expense  deferred compensation expense or income  temporary personnel fees  the costs of our facilities  utility expense  professional fees  depreciation expense on our capital equipment and amortization expense on our intangible assets 
while selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal from the prior year  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses declined in fiscal to from in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of sales was due to our continued efforts to control costs 
the dollar increase was primarily the result of incremental expenses associated with our increased revenue in the united states  including a increase in sales personnel  and the acquisition of emj data systems limited in september  which accounted for an increase of approximately million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  our general and administrative costs have increased due to incremental costs associated with being a public company  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of netted against selling  general and administrative expenses are reimbursements from oem suppliers of million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the reimbursements relate to marketing  infrastructure and promotion programs such as advertisements in trade publications  direct marketing campaigns through mail and e mail and product demonstrations at trade shows 
we make the arrangements and pay for the advertising  facility fees and other costs of the programs  which feature the oem suppliers products 
if our oem suppliers had not offered reimbursements for these programs  then we might have chosen not to have these programs and incur the related costs 
while we continually strive to maintain the lowest possible cost structure in running our operations  we do expect that our selling  general and administrative expense will increase in future periods due to the related costs associated with being a public entity  and  if we continue to grow our revenues  incremental costs associated with increased revenues 

table of contents income from operations 
year ended november  year ended november  change in thousands in thousands income from operations distribution income from operations contract assembly income from operations income from operations as a percentage of revenue of for fiscal improved slightly from in fiscal due to the decline in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales  partially offset by the decline in gross margin percentage 
despite the increase in our sales  our distribution operating income percentage was essentially unchanged primarily due to additional costs associated with being a public company and an increase in the operating loss from our operations in mexico to a loss of million in fiscal from a loss of million in fiscal the increase in the operating loss in mexico was primarily a result of a weak local economy and an increase in bad debt expense 
the increase in contract assembly operating margin was primarily due to a significant increase in production volumes in fiscal  which allowed for the absorption of fixed overhead and other administrative expenses 
interest expense  net 
year ended november  year ended november  change in thousands in thousands interest expense  net amounts recorded in interest expense  net are primarily interest expense paid on our lines of credit  long term debt and deferred compensation liability offset by income earned on our excess cash investments

year ended november  year ended november  change in thousands in thousands other income expense  net amounts recorded in other income expense  net include fees associated with third party accounts receivable flooring arrangements  fees associated with the sale of accounts receivable through our securitization facility  foreign currency transaction gains and losses  investment gains and losses  including those in our deferred compensation plan and other non operating gains and losses 
other income expense  net decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to a million decrease in foreign currency transaction losses 
this was partially offset by a million increase in finance charges as a result of having to finance increased working capital requirements in fiscal due to higher sales volume 
the foreign currency transaction losses in fiscal were incurred primarily as a result of purchases of forward contracts not conducted within normal company hedging practices and procedures  combined with a weakening us dollar 
provision for income taxes 
income taxes consist of our current and deferred tax expense resulting from our income earned in domestic and foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared with an effective tax rate of in fiscal the decrease in our income tax provision and effective tax rate was primarily a result of tax benefits from stock option exercises and a million income tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance resulting from the final tax accounting of our acquisition of merisel canada  inc

fiscal years ended november  and revenue 
year ended november  year ended november  change in thousands in thousands revenue distribution revenue contract assembly revenue the increase in our distribution revenue was mainly attributable to market share increases as a result of increased selling efforts  primarily in the united states  and the acquisition of gates arrow distributing in may the increase was also attributable to the commencement of our mexico distribution operations in april our mexico operations accounted for million of the distribution revenue increase in fiscal compared to fiscal despite the significant increase in revenue from our mexico operations  we were not satisfied with the operating margins of this entity  as discussed below 
after several years of decline  product demand in the it distribution channel stabilized in the second half of  especially in the united states 
the increase in our distribution revenue was somewhat mitigated by significant competition in the it distribution marketplace  continued efforts by some oems  including hp  our largest oem  to sell more of their product directly to end users  bypassing the it distribution channel  and general declines in average selling prices of the products we sell 
the decline in contract assembly revenue was the result of a decline in demand for it products that we assemble for our primary oem customer  sun microsystems 
despite the overall decline in assembly revenue in fiscal  we did experience an increase in revenues in the second half of fiscal with revenues totaling million in the last six months of fiscal compared to million in the first six months of fiscal due to an increase in new product sales to sun microsystems 
gross profit 
year ended november  year ended november  change in thousands in thousands gross profit percentage of revenue gross margins of of revenue in fiscal remained virtually flat as compared with fiscal overall gross margin was negatively impacted as the result of the change in revenue mix between our lower gross margin distribution business and our higher gross margin contract assembly business  however this was mostly offset by an increase in contract assembly gross margins 
distribution gross margin was essentially unchanged for fiscal as compared with fiscal as a result of our efforts to maintain our pricing policies in selling our products 
however  we did experience a decline in our distribution gross margins in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal primarily due to increased sales volumes to larger customers  which generally carry lower margins and competitive pricing pressures 
contract assembly margins increased  primarily in the second half of the year  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a favorable product mix of products with higher gross margins 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
year ended november  year ended november  change in thousands in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of revenue the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily a result of the commencement of our mexico distribution operations in april  which accounted for million of the selling  general and administrative expense increase  a million charge relating to the departure of a former executive officer  and a loss on a disposition of property and equipment of million 
incremental expenses associated with our increased revenue in north america also contribute to the rise in selling  general and administrative expenses  however these were partially offset by decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses outside of north america and mexico 
netted against selling  general and administrative expenses are reimbursements from oem suppliers of million for fiscal  compared to million fiscal the reimbursements relate to marketing  infrastructure and promotion programs such as advertisements in trade publications  direct marketing campaigns through mail and e mail and product demonstrations at trade shows

liquidity and capital resources cash flows our business is working capital intensive 
our working capital needs are primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we rely heavily on debt  accounts receivable flooring programs and the sale of our accounts receivable under our securitization program for our working capital needs 
we have financed our growth and cash needs to date primarily through working capital financing facilities  bank credit lines  the proceeds from our initial public offering and cash generated from operations 
the primary uses of cash have been to fund increases in inventory and accounts receivable resulting from increased sales  and for acquisitions 
we had positive net working capital of and million at november  and  respectively 
we believe that cash flows from operations  our current cash balance and funds available under our working capital and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the next months 
to increase our market share and better serve our customers  we may further expand our operations through investments or acquisitions 
we expect that this expansion would require an initial investment in personnel  facilities and operations  which may be more costly than similar investments in current operations 
as a result of these investments  we may experience an increase in cost of sales and operating expenses that is disproportionate to revenue from those operations 
these investments or acquisitions would likely be funded primarily by incurring additional debt or issuing additional common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to cash generated from net income of million and depreciation and amortization of million offset by the use of cash for working capital of million 
the cash used for working capital in fiscal was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable  receivables from vendors and inventory  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and payables to affiliates

the cash used for working capital in fiscal was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable  inventory and other assets as well as a decrease in payable to affiliates  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the fluctuations in our accounts receivable  inventory  other assets  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily related to the increase in our distribution revenue in the period 
the decrease in payable to affiliates was primarily related to the decline in our contract assembly operations in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the use of cash in fiscal was primarily the result of the acquisition of emj data systems limited for million and capital expenditures of million  mostly for leasehold improvements and computer equipment upgrades

capital resources our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million at november  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we have a six year revolving accounts receivable securitization program in the united states  which provides for the sale of up to million of us trade accounts receivable to general electric capital 
table of contents corporation  which expires in august in december the accounts receivable securitization program was amended to allow us to sell up to million of receivables 
in connection with this program substantially all of our us trade accounts receivable are transferred without recourse to our wholly owned subsidiary  which  in turn  sells the accounts receivables to the financial institution 
sales of the accounts receivables to the financial institution under this program result in a reduction of total accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining accounts receivables not sold to general electric capital corporation are carried at their net realizable value  including an allowance for doubtful accounts 
our effective borrowing cost under the program is the prevailing commercial paper rate of return plus per annum 
at november  and november   the amount of our accounts receivable sold to and held by general electric capital corporation under this accounts receivable securitization program totaled million and million  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal was due to payments to general electric capital corporation from the proceeds of our initial public offering  partially offset by increased sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program necessary to support higher revenues 
we believe that available funding under our accounts receivable financing programs provides us increased flexibility to make incremental investments in strategic growth initiatives and to manage working capital requirements  and that there are sufficient trade accounts receivable to support the us financing programs 
as we have in prior periods  we expect we will increase this facility if our revenue levels continue to increase 
under the program  we continue to service the accounts receivable  and receive a service fee from general electric capital corporation 
the program contains customary financial covenants  including  but not limited to  requiring us to maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum net worth at the end of each fiscal quarter in each fiscal year ending on or after november  of not less than the sum of i the minimum net worth required under the arrangement for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus ii an amount equal to of the positive net income of us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus iii an amount equal to of the amount of any equity raised by or capital contributed to us during the immediately preceding fiscal year  a fixed charge ratio for each rolling period from and after the closing of the arrangement of not less than to

rolling period means as of the end of any or our fiscal quarters  the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters including the fiscal quarter then ending  and with respect to our wholly owned subsidiary  a net worth percentage of not less than 
we are also obligated to provide periodic financial statements and investment reports  notices of material litigation and any other information relating to our us trade accounts receivables as requested by general electric capital corporation 
as is customary in trade accounts receivable securitization arrangements  a credit rating agency s downgrade of the third party issuer of commercial paper or of a back up liquidity provider which provides a source of funding if the commercial paper market cannot be accessed could result in an adverse change or loss of our financing capacity under these programs if the commercial paper issuer and or liquidity back up provider is not replaced 
loss of such financing capacity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have also issued guarantees to certain vendors of our subsidiaries for the total amount of million as of november  and million as of november  
table of contents we have also issued guarantees of c million in relation to a revolving loan agreement between synnex canada and a financial institution and million in relation to a revolving loan agreement between synnex mexico and a financial institution 
we are obligated under these guarantees to pay amounts due should our subsidiaries not pay valid amounts owed to their vendors or lenders 
the vendor guarantees are typically six month to one year arrangements  with day cancellation clauses and the lender guarantees are typically for the term of the loan agreement 
on balance sheet arrangements we have entered into a senior secured revolving line of credit arrangement  or the revolver  with a group of financial institutions  which is secured by our inventory and expires in the revolver s maximum commitment is of eligible inventory valued at the lower of cost or market  less liquidation reserve as defined up to a maximum borrowing of million 
interest on borrowings under the revolver is based on the financial institution s prime rate or libor plus at our option 
the balance outstanding at november  was million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver at november  our subsidiary  synnex canada  has a revolving loan agreement with a group of financial institutions 
at november  the credit limit was c million and matures in september in december the credit limit was increased to c million 
borrowings under the loan agreement are collateralized by substantially all of synnex canada s assets  including inventories and accounts receivable 
borrowings bear interest at the prime rate of a canadian bank designated by the financial institution plus or at the financial institution s bankers acceptance rate plus for canadian dollar denominated loans  at the prime rate of a us bank designated by the financial institution or at libor plus for us dollar denominated loans 
the balance outstanding at november  and was and million  respectively 
we have other lines of credit and revolving facilities with financial institutions  which provide for borrowing capacity aggregating approximately and million at november  and  respectively 
at november  and  we had borrowings of and million  respectively  outstanding under these facilities 
we also have various term loans  bonds and mortgages with financial institutions totaling approximately and million at november  and  respectively 
the expiration dates of these facilities range from to future principal payments due under these term loans  bonds and mortgages and payments due under our operating lease arrangements after november  are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years years contractual obligations principal debt payments non cancelable operating leases total we are in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in our accounts receivable financing programs and credit agreements discussed above 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all 
table of contents share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for the company in the quarter ending november  the company is in the process of assessing the impact of adopting this new standard 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs sfas  which adopts wording from the international accounting standards board s ias inventories in an effort to improve the comparability of international financial reporting 
the new standard indicates that abnormal freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be treated as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory cost 
additionally  the standard clarifies that fixed production overhead should be allocated based on the normal capacity of a production facility 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect our operating results we anticipate that our revenue and operating results will fluctuate  which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our operating results have fluctuated and will fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  including general economic conditions and weakness in it spending  the loss or consolidation of one or more of our significant original equipment manufacturer  or oem  suppliers or customers  market acceptance and product life of the products we assemble and distribute  competitive conditions in our industry  which may impact our margins  pricing  margin and other terms with our oem suppliers  variations in our levels of excess inventory and doubtful accounts  and changes in the terms of oem supplier sponsored programs  such as price protection and return rights  changes in our costs and operating expenses  and the contribution to our total revenue of our international operations 
although we attempt to control our expense levels  these levels are based  in part  on anticipated revenue 
therefore  we may not be able to control spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
our operating results also are affected by the seasonality of the it products industry 
we have historically experienced higher sales in our fourth fiscal quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting  federal government spending and purchasing cycles of end users 
these patterns may not be repeated in subsequent periods 
you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance 
the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
in future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which would likely cause our share price to decline 
we depend on a small number of oems to supply the it products that we sell and the loss of  or a material change in  our business relationship with a major oem supplier could adversely affect our business  financial position and operating results 
our future success is highly dependent on our relationships with a small number of oem suppliers 
sales of hp products represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal and of our total revenue in fiscal sales of ibm products represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal and 
table of contents less than of our total revenue in fiscal our oem supplier agreements typically are short term and may be terminated without cause upon short notice 
the loss or deterioration of our relationships with a major oem supplier  the authorization by oem suppliers of additional distributors  the sale of products by oem suppliers directly to our reseller customers and end users  or our failure to establish relationships with new oem suppliers or to expand the distribution and supply chain services that we provide oem suppliers could adversely affect our business  financial position and operating results 
in addition  oem suppliers may face liquidity or solvency issues that in turn could negatively affect our business and operating results 
our business is also highly dependent on the terms provided by our oem suppliers 
generally  each oem supplier has the ability to change the terms and conditions of their sales agreements  such as reducing the amount of price protection and return rights or reducing the level of purchase discounts  rebates and marketing programs available to us 
if we are unable to pass the impact of these changes through to our reseller customers  our business  financial position and operating results could be adversely affected 
our gross margins are low  which magnifies the impact of variations in revenue  operating costs  bad debts and interest expense on our operating results 
as a result of significant price competition in the it products industry  our gross margins are low  and we expect them to continue to be low in the future 
increased competition arising from industry consolidation and low demand for certain it products may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margins 
these low gross margins magnify the impact of variations in revenue  operating costs  bad debts and interest expense on our operating results 
a portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed  and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders that are forecasted with limited visibility of future demand 
as a result  we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to mitigate any further reductions in gross margins in the future 
if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure in response to competitive price pressures  our business and operating results could suffer 
we also receive purchase discounts and rebates from oem suppliers based on various factors  including sales or purchase volume and breadth of customers 
a decrease in net sales could negatively affect the level of volume rebates received from our oem suppliers and thus  our gross margins 
because some rebates from oem suppliers are based on percentage increases in sales of products  it may become more difficult for us to achieve the percentage growth in sales required for larger discounts due to the current size of our revenue base 
a decrease or elimination of purchase discounts and rebates from our oem suppliers would adversely affect our business and operating results 
because we sell on a purchase order basis  we are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by our reseller and contract assembly customers  which could decrease revenue and adversely affect our operating results 
we sell to our reseller and contract assembly customers on a purchase order basis rather than pursuant to long term contracts or contracts with minimum purchase requirements 
consequently  our sales are subject to demand variability by our reseller and contract assembly customers 
the level and timing of orders placed by our reseller and contract assembly customers vary for a variety of reasons  including seasonal buying by end users  the introduction of new hardware and software technologies and general economic conditions 
customers submitting a purchase order may cancel  reduce or delay their orders 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demands of our reseller and contract assembly customers  we may lose customers because we have an inadequate supply of products  or we may have excess inventory  either of which may harm our business  financial position and operating results 
we are subject to the risk that our inventory value may decline  and protective terms under our oem supplier agreements may not adequately cover the decline in value  which in turn may harm our business  financial position and operating results 
the it products industry is subject to rapid technological change  new and enhanced product specification requirements  and evolving industry standards 
these changes may cause inventory on hand to decline 
table of contents substantially in value or to rapidly become obsolete 
most of our oem suppliers offer limited protection from the loss in value of inventory 
for example  we can receive a credit from many oem suppliers for products held in inventory in the event of a supplier price reduction 
in addition  we have a limited right to return a certain percentage of purchases to most oem suppliers 
these policies are subject to time restrictions and do not protect us in all cases from declines in inventory value 
in addition  our oem suppliers may become unable or unwilling to fulfill their protection obligations to us 
the decrease or elimination of price protection or the inability of our oem suppliers to fulfill their protection obligations could lower our gross margins and cause us to record inventory write downs 
if we are unable to manage our inventory with our oem suppliers with a high degree of precision  we may have insufficient product supplies or we may have excess inventory  resulting in inventory write downs  either of which may harm our business  financial position and operating results 
we depend on oem suppliers to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis  and any supply shortages or delays could cause us to be unable to fulfill orders on a timely basis  which in turn could harm our business  financial position and operating results 
our ability to obtain particular products in the required quantities and to fulfill reseller customer orders on a timely basis is critical to our success 
in most cases  we have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with our oem suppliers 
we occasionally experience a supply shortage of certain products as a result of strong demand or problems experienced by our oem suppliers 
if shortages or delays persist  the price of those products may increase  or the products may not be available at all 
in addition  our oem suppliers may decide to distribute  or to substantially increase their existing distribution business  through other distributors  their own dealer networks  or directly to resellers 
accordingly  if we are not able to secure and maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill our reseller customer orders on a timely basis  our business  financial position and operating results may be adversely affected 
a portion of our revenue is financed by floor plan financing companies and any termination or reduction in these financing arrangements could harm our business and operating results 
a portion of our distribution revenue is financed by floor plan financing companies 
floor plan financing companies are engaged by our customers to finance  or floor  the purchase of products from us 
in exchange for a fee  we transfer the risk of loss on the sale of our products to the floor plan companies 
we currently receive payment from these financing companies within approximately business days from the date of the sale  which allows our business to operate at much lower relative working capital levels than if such programs were not available 
if these floor plan arrangements are terminated or substantially reduced  the need for more working capital and the increased financing cost could harm our business and operating results 
we have not experienced any termination or significant reduction in floor plan arrangements in the past 
we have significant credit exposure to our reseller customers  and negative trends in their businesses could cause us significant credit loss and negatively impact our cash flow and liquidity position 
we extend credit to our reseller customers for a significant portion of our sales to them 
resellers have a period of time  generally days after the date of invoice  to make payment 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that our reseller customers will not pay for the products they purchase 
our credit exposure risk may increase due to liquidity or solvency issues experienced by our resellers as a result of an economic downturn or a decrease in it spending by end users 
if we are unable to collect payment for products we ship to our reseller customers or if our reseller customers are unable to timely pay for the products we ship to them  it will be more difficult or costly to utilize receivable based financing  which could negatively impact our cash flow and liquidity position 
we experienced theft of product from our warehouses 
future thefts could harm our operating results 
although from time to time we have experienced incidents of theft at various facilities  in fiscal we experienced theft as a result of break ins at three of our warehouses in which approximately million of 
table of contents inventory was stolen 
based on our investigation  discussions with local law enforcement and meetings with federal authorities  we believe the thefts at our warehouses were part of an organized crime effort that targeted a number of technology equipment warehouses throughout the united states 
as a result of the loss  we reduced our inventory value by million  and recorded estimated proceeds  net of deductibles as a receivable from our insurance company  included within other current assets on our balance sheet as of november  in january we received a final settlement from our insurance company that amounted to substantially all of the receivable recorded as of november  these types of incidents may make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain theft coverage in the future 
there is no assurance that future incidents of theft will not re occur 
a significant portion of our contract assembly revenue comes from a single customer  and any decrease in sales from this customer could adversely affect our revenue 
our primary contract assembly customer  sun microsystems  accounted for approximately million or of our contract assembly revenue in fiscal and approximately million or of our contract assembly revenue in fiscal sun microsystems accounted for less than of our total revenue in fiscal and of our total revenue in fiscal revenue from sun microsystems has increased in the past two years  but it could decrease in the future 
the future success of our relationship with sun microsystems depends on mitac international continuing to work with us to service sun microsystems needs 
our relationship with sun microsystems evolved from a customer relationship initiated by mitac international and is a joint relationship with mitac international 
we rely on mitac international to manufacture and supply subassemblies and components for the computer systems we assemble for sun microsystems 
if we are unable to maintain our relationship with mitac international  our relationship with sun microsystems could suffer  which in turn could harm our business  financial position and operating results 
in addition  if we were unable to obtain assembly contracts for new and successful products our business and operating results would suffer 
for example  a loss of contract assembly business from sun microsystems would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results in subsequent periods 
we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions or investments in new markets and may encounter risks associated with these activities  which could harm our business and operating results 
the distribution and contract assembly industries have experienced significant consolidation due to price erosion and market competition  augmented by economic downturns in previous years 
we expect this consolidation to continue 
we have in the past pursued and in the future expect to pursue acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses and assets in new markets  either within or outside the it products industry  that complement or expand our existing business 
our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks  including difficulty in successfully integrating acquired operations  it systems  customers  oem supplier and partner relationships  products and businesses with our operations  loss of key employees of acquired operations or inability to hire key employees necessary for our expansion  diversion of our capital and management attention away from other business issues  an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements  in the case of acquisitions that we may make outside of the united states  difficulty in operating in foreign countries and over significant geographical distances  and other financial risks  such as potential liabilities of the businesses we acquire 
our growth may be limited and our competitive position may be harmed if we are unable to identify  finance and complete future acquisitions 
we believe that further expansion may be a prerequisite to our long term success as some of our competitors in the it product distribution industry have larger international operations  
table of contents higher revenues and greater financial resources than us 
we have incurred costs and encountered difficulties in the past in connection with our acquisitions and investments 
for example  our operating margins were initially adversely affected as a result of our acquisition of merisel canada inc and we have written off substantial investments in the past  one of which was emanage 
com  inc also  our recent acquisition of emj has caused an initial negative effect on our operating margins as we integrate emj s systems  operations and personnel 
future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  large write offs  a decrease in future profitability  or future losses 
the incurrence of debt in connection with any future acquisitions could restrict our ability to obtain working capital or other financing necessary to operate our business 
our recent and future acquisitions or investments may not be successful  and if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we are dependent on a variety of it and telecommunications systems  and any failure of these systems could adversely impact our business and operating results 
we depend on it and telecommunications systems for our operations 
these systems support a variety of functions  including inventory management  order processing  shipping  shipment tracking and billing 
failures or significant downtime of our it or telecommunications systems could prevent us from taking customer orders  printing product pick lists  operating our automated product pick machinery  shipping products or billing customers 
sales also may be affected if our reseller customers are unable to access our price and product availability information 
we also rely on the internet  and in particular electronic data interchange  or edi  for a large portion of our orders and information exchanges with our oem suppliers and reseller customers 
the internet and individual web sites have experienced a number of disruptions and slowdowns  some of which were caused by organized attacks 
in addition  some web sites have experienced security breakdowns 
if we were to experience a security breakdown  disruption or breach that compromised sensitive information  it could harm our relationship with our oem suppliers or reseller customers 
disruption of our web site or the internet in general could impair our order processing or more generally prevent our oem suppliers or reseller customers from accessing information 
the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we rely on independent shipping companies for delivery of products  and price increases or service interruptions from these carriers could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we rely almost entirely on arrangements with independent shipping companies  such as fedex and ups  for the delivery of our products from oem suppliers and delivery of products to reseller customers 
freight and shipping charges can have a significant impact on our gross margin 
as a result  an increase in freight surcharges due to rising fuel cost or general price increases will have an immediate adverse effect on our margins  unless we are able to pass the increased charges to our reseller customers or renegotiate terms with our oem suppliers 
in addition  in the past  ups has experienced work stoppages due to labor negotiations with management 
the termination of our arrangements with one or more of these independent shipping companies  the failure or inability of one or more of these independent shipping companies to deliver products  or the unavailability of their shipping services  even temporarily  could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
part of our business is conducted outside of the united states  exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states  which in turn could cause our business and operating results to suffer 
we have international operations in canada  china  japan  mexico and the united kingdom 
in fiscal and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue was generated outside the united states 
in fiscal and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue was generated in canada 
no other country or region accounted for more than of our total revenue 
our international operations are subject to risks  including political or economic instability  
table of contents changes in governmental regulation  changes in import export duties  trade restrictions  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing operations in certain foreign countries  work stoppages or other changes in labor conditions  difficulties in collecting of accounts receivables on a timely basis or at all  taxes  and seasonal reductions in business activity in some parts of the world  such as europe 
we may continue to expand internationally to respond to competitive pressure and customer and market requirements 
establishing operations in any other foreign country or region presents risks such as those described above as well as risks specific to the particular country or region 
in addition  until a payment history is established over time with customers in a new geography or region  the likelihood of collecting receivables generated by such operations could be less than our expectations 
as a result  there is a greater risk that reserves set with respect to the collection of such receivables may be inadequate 
for example  we commenced our mexico operations in april and we have incurred operating losses  partially due to higher than expected losses on receivable collections 
we have established and subsequently ceased operations in foreign countries in the past  which caused us to incur additional expense and loss 
if our international expansion efforts in any foreign country are unsuccessful  we may decide to cease operations  which would likely cause us to incur similar additional expenses and loss 
in addition  changes in policies and or laws of the united states or foreign governments resulting in  among other things  higher taxation  currency conversion limitations  restrictions on fund transfers or the expropriation of private enterprises  could reduce the anticipated benefits of our international expansion 
furthermore  any actions by countries in which we conduct business to reverse policies that encourage foreign trade or investment could adversely affect our business 
if we fail to realize the anticipated revenue growth of our future international operations  our business and operating results could suffer 
because we conduct substantial operations in china  risks associated with economic  political and social events in china could negatively affect our business and operating results 
a substantial portion of our it systems operations  including our it systems support and software development operations  is located in china 
in addition  we also conduct general and administrative activities from our facility in china 
as of november   we had personnel located in china 
we expect to increase our operations in china in the future 
our operations in china are subject to a number of risks relating to china s economic and political systems  including a government fixed foreign exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of the chinese renminbi  extensive government regulation  changing governmental policies relating to tax benefits available to foreign owned businesses  the telecommunications infrastructure  a relatively uncertain legal system  and uncertainties related to continued economic and social reform  including the effect of china s recent entry into the world trade organization 
in addition  external events in asia  such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  and heightened political tensions in this region may adversely affect our business by disrupting the it supply chain  restricting travel or interfering with the electronic and communications infrastructure 

table of contents our it systems are an important part of our global operations 
any significant interruption in service  whether resulting from any of the above uncertainties  natural disasters or otherwise  could result in delays in our inventory purchasing  errors in order fulfillment  reduced levels of customer service and other disruptions in operations  any of which could cause our business and operating results to suffer 
changes in foreign exchange rates and limitations on the convertibility of foreign currencies could adversely affect our business and operating results 
in fiscal and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue was generated outside the united states 
most of our international revenue  cost of revenue and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
we presently have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar may adversely affect our operating margins 
for example  if these foreign currencies appreciate against the us dollar  it will make it more expensive in terms of us dollars to purchase inventory or pay expenses with foreign currencies 
this could have a negative impact to us if revenues related to these purchases are transacted in us dollars 
in addition  currency devaluation can result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency as well as make our products  which are usually purchased by us with us dollars  relatively more expensive than products manufactured locally 
we currently conduct only limited hedging activities  which involve the use of currency forward contracts 
hedging foreign currencies can be risky 
for example  in fiscal we incurred million of foreign currency transaction losses as a result of purchases of forward contracts not conducted within our normal hedging practices and procedures  combined with a weakening us dollar 
there is also additional risk if the currency is not freely or actively traded 
some currencies  such as the chinese renminbi  are subject to limitations on conversion into other currencies  which can limit our ability to hedge or to otherwise react to rapid foreign currency devaluations 
we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business and operating results 
because of the experience of our key personnel in the it products industry and their technological expertise  if we were to lose any of our key personnel  it could inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully 
we operate in the highly competitive it products industry 
we are dependent in large part on our ability to retain the services of our key senior executives and other technical experts and personnel 
our employees and executives do not have employment agreements 
furthermore  we do not carry key person insurance coverage for any of our key executives 
we compete for qualified senior management and technical personnel 
the loss of  or inability to hire  key executives or qualified employees could inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully 
we may become involved in intellectual property or other disputes that could cause us to incur substantial costs  divert the efforts of our management  and require us to pay substantial damages or require us to obtain a license  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we may from time to time receive notifications alleging infringements of intellectual property rights allegedly held by others relating to our business or the products we sell or assemble for our oem suppliers and others 
litigation with respect to patents or other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have an adverse effect on our business 
although we generally have various levels of indemnification protection from our oem suppliers and contract assembly customers  in many cases any indemnification to which we may be entitled is subject to maximum limits or other restrictions 
in addition  we have developed proprietary it systems that play an important role in our business 
if any infringement claim is successful against us and if indemnification is not available or sufficient  we may be required to pay substantial damages or we may need to seek and obtain a license of the other party s intellectual property rights 
we may be unable to obtain such a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 

table of contents we are from time to time involved in other litigation in the ordinary course of business 
for example  we are currently defending a trademark infringement action  a civil matter involving third party investors in emanage 
com  inc and various bankruptcy preference actions 
we may not be successful in defending these or other claims 
regardless of the outcome  litigation can result in substantial expense and could divert the efforts of our management 
because of the capital intensive nature of our business  we need continued access to capital  which  if not available to us  could harm our ability to operate or expand our business 
our business requires significant levels of capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors 
if cash from available sources is insufficient  or if cash is used for unanticipated needs  we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated 
in the event we are required  or elect  to raise additional funds  we may be unable to do so on favorable terms  or at all 
our current and future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for  or react to  changes in our business or industry 
we could also be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in any credit arrangements  including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends 
furthermore  the cost of debt financing could significantly increase  making it cost prohibitive to borrow  which could force us to issue new equity securities 
if we issue new equity securities  existing stockholders may experience additional dilution  or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
the terms of our indebtedness agreements impose significant restrictions on our ability to operate which in turn may negatively affect our ability to respond to business and market conditions and therefore have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
as of november   we had approximately million in outstanding short and long term borrowings under term loans and lines of credit  excluding trade payables 
as of november   approximately million of our accounts receivable were sold to and held by general electric capital corporation under our accounts receivable securitization program 
the terms of our current indebtedness agreements restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  consummate certain asset sales or acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  and merge  consolidate or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
we are also required to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  including minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage ratio as outlined in our senior secured revolving line of credit arrangement 
we may be unable to meet these ratios and tests  which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of the related debt  the termination of the facility or the increase in our effective cost of funds 
as a result  our ability to operate may be restricted and our ability to respond to business and market conditions limited  which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we have significant operations concentrated in northern california  south carolina and toronto and any disruption in the operations of our facilities could harm our business and operating results 
our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions  which could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 
we have significant 
table of contents operations in our facilities located in fremont  california  greenville  south carolina and toronto 
as a result  any prolonged disruption in the operations of our facilities  whether due to technical difficulties  power failures  destruction or damage to the facilities as a result of a natural disaster  fire or any other reason  could harm our operating results 
we currently do not have a formal disaster recovery plan and may not have sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate for losses that could occur 
global health  economic  political and social conditions may harm our ability to do business  increase our costs and negatively affect our stock price 
external factors such as potential terrorist attacks  acts of war or geopolitical and social turmoil in many parts of the world could prevent or hinder our ability to do business  increase our costs and negatively affect our stock price 
for example  increased instability may adversely impact the desire of employees and customers to travel  the reliability and cost of transportation  our ability to obtain adequate insurance at reasonable rates or require us to incur increased costs for security measures for our domestic and international operations 
these uncertainties make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately plan future business activities 
more generally  these geopolitical social and economic conditions could result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
we rely on mitac international for certain manufacturing and assembly services and the loss of these services would require us to seek alternate providers  which may charge us more for their services 
we rely on mitac international to manufacture and supply subassemblies and components for some of our contract assembly customers  including sun microsystems  currently our primary contract assembly customer  and our reliance on mitac international may increase in the future 
our relationship with mitac international has been informal and is not governed by long term commitments or arrangements with respect to pricing terms  revenue or capacity commitments 
accordingly  we negotiate manufacturing and pricing terms on a project by project basis  based on manufacturing services rendered by mitac international or us 
in the event mitac international no longer provides such services and components to us  we would need to find an alternative source for these services and components 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain alternative services and components on similar terms  which may in turn increase our manufacturing costs 
in addition  we may not find manufacturers with sufficient capacity  which may in turn lead to shortages in our product supplies 
increased costs and products shortages could harm our business and operating results 
the payment terms relating to the purchase and sale of product to mitac international are similar to the terms that we have with nonaffiliated customers and vendors 
our business relationship to date with mitac international has been informal and is not governed by long term commitments or arrangements with respect to pricing terms  revenue or capacity commitments 
accordingly  we negotiate manufacturing and pricing terms  including allocating customer revenue  on a case by case basis with mitac international 
our business relationship with mitac international has been and will continue to be negotiated as related parties and therefore may not be the result of arms length negotiations between independent parties 
our relationship  including pricing and other material terms with our shared customers or with mitac international  may or may not be as advantageous to us as the terms we could have negotiated with unaffiliated third parties 
we have a joint sales and marketing agreement with mitac international  pursuant to which both parties agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to promote the other party s service offerings to their respective customers who are interested in such product offerings 
to date  there has not been a significant amount of sales attributable to the joint marketing agreement 
this agreement does not provide for the terms upon which we negotiate manufacturing and pricing terms 
these negotiations have been on a case by case basis 
the agreement had an initial term of one year and will automatically renew for subsequent one year terms unless either party provides written notice of non renewal within days of the end of any renewal term 
the agreement may also be terminated without cause either by the mutual written agreement of both parties or by either party without cause upon days prior written notice of termination to the 
table of contents other party 
either party may immediately terminate the agreement by providing written notice of a the other party s material breach of any provision of the agreement and failure to cure within days  or b if the other party becomes bankrupt or insolvent 
in addition  we are party to a general agreement with mitac international and sun microsystems under which we work with mitac international to provide contract assembly services to sun microsystems 
we do not currently anticipate entering into any long term commitments or arrangements with mitac international 
we have adopted a policy requiring material transactions in which any of our directors has a potential conflict of interest to be approved by our audit committee  which is composed of disinterested members of the board 
some of our customer relationships evolved from relationships between such customers and mitac international and the loss of such relationships could harm our business and operating results 
our relationship with sun microsystems and some of our other customers evolved from customer relationships that were initiated by mitac international 
our relationship with sun microsystems is a joint relationship with mitac international and us  and the future success of our relationship with sun microsystems depends on mitac international continuing to work with us to service sun microsystems requirements 
the original agreement between sun microsystems and mitac international was signed on august  and we became a party to the agreement on february  substantially all of our contract assembly services to sun microsystems are covered by the general agreement 
the agreement continues indefinitely until terminated in accordance with its terms 
sun microsystems may terminate this agreement for any reason on days written notice 
any party may terminate the agreement with written notice if one of the other parties materially breaches any provision of the agreement and the breach is incapable of being cured or is not cured within days 
the agreement may also be terminated on written notice if one of the other parties becomes bankrupt or insolvent 
if we are unable to maintain our relationship with mitac international  our relationship with sun microsystems could suffer and we could lose other customer relationships or referrals  which in turn could harm our business  financial position and operating results 
there could be potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of mitac international  which could impact our business and operating results 
mitac international s and its affiliates continuing beneficial ownership of our common stock could create conflicts of interest with respect to a variety of matters  such as potential acquisitions  competition  issuance or disposition of securities  election of directors  payment of dividends and other business matters 
similar risks could exist as a result of matthew miau s positions as our chairman  the chairman of mitac international and as a director or officer of mitac international s affiliated companies 
in fiscal  mr 
miau received a retainer of  for his performance as chairman 
for fiscal year  our compensation committee has recommended and the board of directors has approved a  retainer for mr 
miau 
mr 
miau s compensation is based primarily upon his non executive back up role to mr 
huang in the event mr 
huang were unable to serve as president and chief executive officer and certain time commitments devoted to us as our chairman 
any future compensation payable to mr 
miau will be based upon the recommendation of the compensation committee and subject to the approval of the board of directors

synnex technology international corp  or synnex technology international  a publicly traded company based in taiwan and affiliated with mitac international  currently provides distribution and fulfillment services to various markets in asia and australia  and is also a potential competitor of ours 
mitac incorporated  a privately held company based in taiwan and a separate entity from mitac international  owns approximately of synnex technology international and approximately of mitac international 
mitac international indirectly owns of synnex technology international and synnex technology international owns approximately of mitac international 
in addition  mitac international indirectly owns 
table of contents approximately of mitac incorporated and synnex technology international owns approximately of mitac incorporated 
synnex technology international indirectly through its ownership of peer developments limited owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
neither mitac international nor synnex technology international is restricted from competing with us 
in the future  we may increasingly compete with synnex technology international  particularly if our business in asia expands or synnex technology international expands its business into geographies or customers we serve 
although synnex technology international is a separate entity  from us  it is possible that there will be confusion as a result of the similarity of our names 
moreover  we cannot limit or control the use of the synnex name by synnex technology international or mitac international  and our use of the synnex name may be restricted as a result of registration of the name by synnex technology international or the prior use in jurisdictions where they currently operate 
as of november   our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders own approximately of our common stock and this concentration of ownership allows them to control all matters requiring stockholder approval and could delay or prevent a change in control of synnex 
as of november   our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in particular  mitac international  through its affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
mitac international and its affiliates own a controlling interest in us as of november  as a result  mitac international s interests and ours may increasingly conflict 
for example  we rely on mitac international for certain manufacturing and supply services and for relationships with certain key customers 
as a result of the decrease in their ownership in us  we may lose these services and relationships  which may lead to increased costs to replace the lost services and the loss of certain key customers 
we cannot predict the likelihood that we may incur increased costs or lose customers if mitac international s ownership percentage of us decreases in the future 
downturn in the it industry could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
the it industry in which we operate has experienced decreases in demand 
softening demand for our products and services caused by an ongoing economic downturn and over capacity were responsible  in part  for a decline in our revenue in fiscal  as well as problems with the saleability of inventory and collection of reseller customer receivables 
the north american economy and market conditions continue to be challenging in the it industry 
as a result  individuals and companies may continue delaying or reducing expenditures  including those for it products 
while in the past we may have benefited from the consolidation in our industry resulting from the slowdown  further delays or reductions in it spending in particular  and economic weakness generally  could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our distribution business may be adversely affected by oem suppliers increasing their commitment to direct sales  which in turn could cause our business and operating results to suffer 
consolidation of oem suppliers has resulted in fewer sources for some of the products that we distribute 
this consolidation has also resulted in larger oem suppliers that have significant operating and financial resources 
some oem suppliers  including some of the leading oem suppliers that we service  have been selling a greater volume of products directly to end users  thereby limiting our business opportunities 
if large oem suppliers continue the trend to sell directly to our resellers  rather than use us as the distributor of their products  our business and operating results will suffer 

table of contents oems are limiting the number of supply chain service providers with which they do business  which in turn would negatively impact our business and operating results 
currently  there is a trend towards reducing the number of authorized distributors used by the oem suppliers 
as a smaller market participant in the it product distribution and contract assembly industries  than some of our competitors  we may be more susceptible to loss of business from further reductions of authorized distributors or contract assemblers by it product oems 
for example  the termination of sun microsystems contract assembly business with us would have a significant negative effect on our revenue and operating results 
a determination by any of our primary oems to consolidate their business with other distributors or contract assemblers would negatively affect our business and operating results 
the it industry is subject to rapidly changing technologies and process developments  and we may not be able to adequately adjust our business to these changes  which in turn would harm our business and operating results 
dynamic changes in the it industry  including the consolidation of oem suppliers and reductions in the number of authorized distributors used by oem suppliers  have resulted in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and have placed  and continue to place  a significant strain upon our management  operating and financial systems and other resources 
we may be unable to successfully respond to and manage our business in light of industry developments and trends 
also crucial to our success in managing our operations will be our ability to achieve additional economies of scale 
our failure to achieve these additional economies of scale or to respond to changes in the it industry could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we are subject to intense competition in the it industry  both in the united states and internationally  and if we fail to compete successfully  we will be unable to gain or retain market share 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  both in the united states and internationally 
the it product distribution and contract assembly industries are characterized by intense competition  based primarily on product availability  credit availability  price  speed of delivery  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  quality and depth of product lines  pre sale and post sale technical support  flexibility and timely response to design changes  technological capabilities  service and support 
we compete with a variety of regional  national and international it product distributors and contract manufacturers and assemblers 
in some instances  we also compete with our own customers  our own oem suppliers and mitac international 
some of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial  operating  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
some of our competitors may have broader geographic breadth and range of services than us and may have more developed relationships with their existing customers 
we may lose market share in the united states or in international markets  or may be forced in the future to reduce our prices in response to the actions of our competitors and thereby experience a reduction in our gross margins 
we may initiate other business activities  including the broadening of our supply chain capabilities  and may face competition from companies with more experience in those new areas 
in addition  as we enter new areas of business  we may also encounter increased competition from current competitors and or from new competitors  including some who may once have been our oem suppliers or reseller customers 
increased competition and negative reaction from our oem suppliers or reseller customers resulting from our expansion into new business areas may harm our business and operating results 
significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could result in securities class action claims against us  which could seriously harm our business 
securities class action claims have been brought against companies in the past where volatility in the market price of that company s securities has taken place 
this kind of litigation could be very costly and divert our management s attention and resources  and any adverse determination in this litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities  any or all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

table of contents compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and new york stock exchange rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our ongoing efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
further  our board members  chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which could harm our business 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed
