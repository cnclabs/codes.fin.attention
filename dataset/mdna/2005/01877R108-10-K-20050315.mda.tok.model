events elk creek and tunnel ridge on october   we announced an agreement  subject to finalization of definitive agreements  to enter into two separate coal leases  which cumulatively will increase our coal reserve holdings by 
the elk creek reserves elk creek are located in hopkins county  kentucky  and the tunnel ridge reserves tunnel ridge are located in ohio county  west virginia and washington county  pennsylvania 
these leases are estimated to contain approximately million tons of high sulfur coal reserves 
the lessor for both leases is our special general partner 
we also announced plans to immediately begin the development process for these properties  which includes obtaining the necessary mining permits and securing sufficient coal sales commitments to justify the capital investment needed to bring these properties into production 
the elk creek reserve area encompasses approximately  acres and is contiguous to our hopkins county coal complex 
the elk creek coal reserves are currently estimated to include approximately million tons of high sulfur coal 
the elk creek mine will be an underground mining complex that mines the west kentucky no 
and no 
coal seams 
we will use continuous mining units  and employ room and pillar mining techniques 
we intend to use the existing coal handling and other surface facilities owned by hopkins county coal 
we anticipate the elk creek complex will employ as many as individuals and produce up to million tons of coal annually 
we estimate total capital expenditures to develop elk creek to be approximately million 
in december   the board of directors of our managing general partner approved the capital expenditures associated with elk creek 
coal supply commitments are currently being pursued 
construction of the elk creek mining complex began in the first quarter of we expect to fund these capital expenditures with available cash and marketable securities on hand  future cash generated from operations and or borrowings available under our revolving credit facility

we anticipate the tunnel ridge operation will use a longwall miner for the majority of its coal extraction as well as continuous mining units for preparation of the mine for future longwall mining 
we estimate the tunnel ridge operation will be designed to produce up to six million tons of coal annually 
we believe production from tunnel ridge may begin as early as we anticipate the tunnel ridge complex will employ as many as individuals
