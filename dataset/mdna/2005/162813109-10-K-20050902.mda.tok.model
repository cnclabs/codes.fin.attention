item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview checkfree was founded in as an electronic payment processing company and has become a leading provider of financial electronic commerce products and services 
our current business was developed through the expansion of our core electronic payments business and the acquisition of companies operating in similar or complementary businesses 
we operate our business through three independent but inter related divisions electronic commerce  investment services  and software 
through our electronic commerce division  we enable consumers to receive and pay bills 
for the year ended june   we processed approximately million payment transactions and delivered approximately million electronic bills e bills 
for the quarter ended june   we processed approximately million payment transactions and delivered more than million e bills 
the number of transactions we process each year continues to grow 
for the year ended june   growth in the number of transactions processed exceeded 
the electronic commerce division accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
through our investment services division  we provide a range of portfolio management services to financial institutions  including broker dealers  money managers and investment advisors

the investment services division accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
through our software division  we deliver software  maintenance  support and professional services to large financial service providers and other companies across a range of industries 
through fiscal  the software division was comprised of three units  each with its own distinct set of software products 
the ach solutions unit provides software and services that are used to process more than two thirds of the nation s ten billion annual automated clearing house ach payments 
the checkfree financial and compliance solutions cfacs unit enables organizations to handle their reconciliation and compliance requirements and provides a financial transactions management solution with straight through processing

refer to the software division description within the business section of this annual report on form k for a further discussion of these product lines 
the software division accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
executive summary due to growth in all of our business segments  including the contribution from acquisitions in fiscal and  our consolidated revenues grew in the year ended june  we earned net income of million in the year ended june   compared to net income of million for the same period last year 
through continued efforts to improve quality and efficiency  we generated approximately million of free cash flow in fiscal year  an increase of million  or  over fiscal year this free cash flow  combined with cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million as of june   allowed us to acquire accurate software limited  accurate for million in cash approximately million net of cash received  and to repurchase  shares of our common stock for million 
increasingly positive operating results allowed us to invest in all of our businesses in order to take full advantage of anticipated growth opportunities 
we define free cash flow 
table of contents as net cash provided by operating activities  exclusive of the net change in settlement accounts  less capital expenditures 
see use of non gaap financial information for further discussion of this measure 
our electronic commerce business continues to expand  generating revenue of million for the year ended june   which represents growth of over the prior year 
during the year ended june   we processed million transactions  an increase of over the previous year 
we delivered about million e bills during fiscal  for growth of over e bills delivered in the prior year 
our electronic payment rate has improved from as of june   to as ofjune  successful efforts to improve efficiency and quality have resulted in lower costs per transaction  allowing us to share scale efficiencies with our customers through reduced revenue per transaction 
our investment services business generated growth in portfolios managed  from about million as of june   to million as of june   resulting in revenue growth of over the same period 
during fiscal  we invested heavily in the rewrite of checkfree apl 
despite the lower than historical operating margin in the near term  these investments will provide us the opportunity to take advantage of the rapidly expanding separately managed accounts smas and sma market 
including the benefits of our acquisitions of heliograph  ltd 
heliograph in november  and accurate in april  our software division experienced revenue growth of during the year ended june  we believe we are positioned to take advantage of the improving us economy  and our presence in europe and the south pacific with expanded operations in the uk  luxembourg  and australia resulting from the accurate acquisition 
as we enter fiscal  we have prepared for the expiration of our five year agreements with microsoft corporation microsoft and first data corporation fdc  resulting from our acquisition of msfdc  llc transpoint in september our contracts with both microsoft and fdc include monthly minimum revenue guarantees that increased annually over their five year term 
the following table represents the total annual minimum revenue guarantees throughout the contract periods with the respective customer in thousands fiscal year ended june  microsoft fdc total total our agreement with fdc expired in august our agreement with microsoft expires in december during fiscal  both agreements were operating substantially below their minimum levels 
as a result  while we expect limited impact to our subscriber base in fiscal year  we expect to see a temporary decline in historical quarterly revenue growth rates  initially in the quarter ended december   but more noticeably in the quarter ended march  we expect to substantially increase our tax payments in fiscal and we expect capital expenses of approximately million as we invest heavily in high availability disaster recovery data center operations 
as a result of these factors  we expect free cash flow of approximately million for the year 
when combined with cash  cash equivalents  and investments totaling million at june   we believe we are positioned to take advantage of additional opportunities for acquisitions as they arise  and we have authority to repurchase up to million of our common stock through july   should we determine the time and price to be appropriate

total revenues s june  change year ended our growth in total revenues of was driven by growth in our electronic commerce business  growth in our investment services business and growth in our software business 
overall growth in electronic commerce  including walk in payments  continues to be driven primarily by growth in transactions processed  from approximately million in the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  additionally  we delivered about million e bills during fiscal  a growth rate of over the approximately million e bills delivered during fiscal lastly  with interest rates increasing throughout the year ended june   we experienced revenue growth in our interest sensitive products such as account balance transfer abt 
this combined growth in our electronic commerce division was offset somewhat by our pricing practices 
we have established pricing models that provide volume based discounts in order to share scale efficiencies 
table of contents with our customers 
as a result of transaction growth  our average revenue per transaction therefore  has declined over time with respect to our transaction based revenue 
growth in our investment services business has been driven primarily by a increase in portfolios managed  from about million at june   to million at june  in some cases  we are adding new portfolios to our checkfree apl system at a lower price point  driven by the increased volume coming from lower priced broker dealers  and by conscious price reductions  where we trade off near term revenue growth against long term strategic advantage 
we believe that more favorable market conditions have resulted in resumed growth in portfolios managed  and we remain cautiously optimistic about resulting growth opportunities 
growth in our software business is due primarily to a full year of heliograph operations in fiscal versus seven months in fiscal and our acquisition of accurate on april  additionally  we have achieved solid growth in our bank products 
we believe this to be the combined result of improved execution within the division and signs of recovery in the us economy 
across all segments of our business  for the year ended june   bank of america generated total revenue of million  which exceeds of our consolidated revenues  and remains the only customer that exceeds of our consolidated revenues 
our agreement with bank of america has a ten year term expiring in  includes annual minimum revenue guarantees of million  and provides tiered pricing which reflects the volume of activity provided by bank of america 
the following tables set forth comparative revenues  by type  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
processing and servicing revenue s june  change year ended we earn processing and servicing revenue in both our electronic commerce and our investment services businesses 
while growth in portfolios managed in our investment services business contributed positively  the increase in processing and servicing revenue is attributed primarily to the aforementioned transaction growth in our electronic commerce business 
annual growth in transactions was heavily influenced by our new walk in payments business  resulting from the acquisition of aps with only seven days remaining in fiscal a full year of walk in payments attributed to almost half of our processing and servicing growth within electronic commerce 
our traditional electronic bill payment products provided the remainder of growth within electronic commerce  with consistent sequential quarterly transaction growth of between and throughout fiscal during fiscal  we delivered approximately million e bills with an average price point of less than per e bill  representing growth over approximately million e bills delivered during fiscal additionally  with interest rates rising over the past fiscal year  we have experienced revenue growth from our interest sensitive products  such as abt 
annual volume based growth in processing and servicing revenue was somewhat offset by tier based volume pricing discounts within both our electronic commerce and investment services businesses 
license fee revenue s june  change year ended we derive license fee revenue from product sales in our software division 
our acquisitions of heliograph in november and accurate in april contributed about two thirds of our license revenue growth in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
despite moderate growth in our traditional software businesses during fiscal  and improving sales pipelines for our products  we remain uncertain 
table of contents as to whether this represents the beginning of a general trend in continued software growth as our customers view purchases of our software as generally discretionary in nature 
maintenance fee revenue s june  change year ended maintenance fee revenue  which represents annually renewable product support for our software customers  is isolated to our software business  and tends to grow with incremental license sales from previous periods 
however  in fiscal  our acquisitions of heliograph and accurate provided approximately three fourths of our year over year growth in maintenance revenue 
the remainder resulted from annual customer retention rates exceeding and moderate price increases across our software product lines 
other revenue s june  change year ended other revenue consists mostly of consulting and implementation fees across all three of our businesses  and with the acquisition of aps  we have added revenue associated with stored value cards to this revenue category 
our acquisitions of heliograph  aps  and accurate provided over half of our year over year growth in other revenue 
implementation services from traditional software product sales resulted in the remainder of growth in this category 
the following set of tables provides line by line expense comparisons with their relative percentages of our consolidated revenues for the years ended june  and  respectively 
cost of processing  servicing and support s june  revenue revenue year ended cost of processing  servicing and support  as a percentage of revenue  has improved by about on a year over year basis 
in electronic commerce  our electronic payment rate has improved from as of june   to as of june  electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than paper based payments and are far less likely to result in costly customer care claims 
the acquisition of aps brought with it a significant number of exclusively electronic payment transactions  accounting for over half of the increase we experienced in our electronic payments rate 
in addition to leveraging a significant fixed cost processing infrastructure  we continue to focus investments on additional efficiency and quality improvements through six sigma based programs in our electronic commerce and investment services customer care and customer support processes  and throughout our technology infrastructure to drive improvement in our cost per transaction and cost per portfolio managed metrics 
these drivers of expense efficiency were offset somewhat by three factors over fiscal the gross margin of our walk in payments business is less than our core electronic billing and payment business  our acquisitions of heliograph and accurate resulted in increased customer support and implementation services resources that carry a lower gross margin than our core electronic commerce and investment services businesses  and 
table of contents during fiscal  we incurred a charge of approximately million for a loss in a services agreement with a large customer in our software business 
we expect to continue to focus attention on six sigma based process improvement and quality programs to lower our costs per payment transaction and portfolios managed in anticipation of continued price pressure within our electronic commerce and investment services businesses 
research and development s june  revenue revenue year ended including capitalized development costs of million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june   gross expenditures for research and development were million  or of consolidated revenues  for the year ended june   and million  or of consolidated revenues  for the year ended june  our acquisitions of heliograph  aps  and accurate provided more than one third of our incremental research and development costs in fiscal  and we have placed particular emphasis on research and development in our investment services business  as we are in the process of a rewrite of our processing system 
we continue to invest heavily in product enhancement and productivity improvement initiatives across all of our businesses  as evidenced by the relatively consistent levels of research and development costs as a percentage of revenue on a year over year basis 
sales and marketing s june  revenue revenue year ended sales and marketing costs  in total and as a percentage of consolidated revenues  have increased during fiscal our acquisitions of heliograph  aps  and accurate contributed approximately of the incremental costs year over year 
in addition  license revenue growth  with a strong finish to fiscal  resulted in accelerated commission rates for salespersons exceeding annual quotas for the year 
finally  in the second half of fiscal  we increased our investment in marketing programs geared toward future revenue growth 
we expect sales and marketing costs  as a percentage of revenue  to fall back below in fiscal general and administrative s june  revenue revenue year ended increased general and administrative costs in fiscal have resulted primarily from incremental facility and other non redundant expenses related to our acquisitions of heliograph  aps and accurate 
additionally  we have experienced incremental sarbanes oxley section compliance costs as we prepared for our first internal controls certification as of june   and expanded facility costs supporting our core businesses during fiscal we continue to expect our general and administrative costs to run between and of consolidated revenues and are managing these costs accordingly 

table of contents depreciation and amortization s june  revenue revenue year ended despite increased intangible amortization resulting from our acquisitions of heliograph  aps and accurate  depreciation and amortization expense declined during fiscal  as a result of the completion of intangible amortization from previous acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense  net of acquisition related intangible amortization  remained essentially flat from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  we expect a significant drop in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal as we complete the amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions of transpoint in fiscal and bluegill technologies  inc in fiscal reorganization charge s june  revenue revenue year ended late in the quarter ended june   we terminated the employment of approximately associates  re scoping many positions with the intent to re hire quickly  and eliminating some others 
as part of this action  we announced that our electronic billing and payment operations in waterloo  ontario  canada  will move to norcross  georgia  and we expect to close the canadian facility in october these actions resulted in a charge of million 
in process research development s june  revenue revenue year ended we recorded immaterial in process research and development costs totaling million related to our acquisition of heliograph in the quarter ended december  there were no such costs associated with our acquisitions of either aps or accurate 
equity in loss of joint venture s june  revenue revenue year ended in april  we announced a joint venture  onevu limited onevu  with voca limited voca  designed to create an integrated electronic billing and payment network for billers and banks in the united kingdom 
we provide of onevu s necessary working capital requirements during its formative stage 
we record the operations of the joint venture on the equity basis of accounting and the equity in net loss of the joint venture represents our portion of the loss incurred by the joint venture during the periods displayed 
the joint venture is still in its formative stage and  therefore  we do not expect it to become profitable in the near term 

table of contents net interest s june  revenue revenue year ended interest income interest expense call premium expense unamortized note issuance costs net interest as a result of an increase in average cash and invested assets  combined with rising interest rates during fiscal  our interest income increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  our interest expense decreased significantly on a year over year basis 
we carried our convertible subordinated notes due at a balance of million through the quarter ended september  we redeemed the notes in full on december  as a result  in the year ended june   we incurred a cash charge of million for a call premium to redeem the notes prior to their scheduled maturity date  and we incurred a non cash charge of million to write off the remaining unamortized note issuance costs 
gain on investments s june  revenue revenue year ended in the quarter ended march   we recorded a million gain on the sale of stock 
while we do not typically invest in equity securities  we received shares of stock from an insurance vendor that demutualized 
we sold the shares shortly after we received them  and recorded the proceeds as a gain on investments 
income tax expense s june  revenue revenue year ended our federal statutory tax rate is  and our overall blended statutory rate federal  state and foreign combined approached without the benefit of tax planning strategies 
our effective rate of for the year ended june   was lower than our blended statutory rate due to research and experimentation tax credits  tax free municipal interest income and foreign tax credits recorded during the year 
our effective tax rate of for the year ended june   was lower than our blended statutory rate due to research and experimentation tax credits and foreign tax credits  offset by the federal alternative minimum tax and the temporary suspension of state level net operating loss carryover credits 

table of contents years ended june  and the following table sets forth our total revenues for the years ended june  and  respectively 
total revenues s june  change year ended our total revenue growth of was driven by growth in our electronic commerce business  growth in our investment services business and growth in our software business 
growth in our electronic commerce business was driven primarily by growth in transactions processed from approximately million for the year ended june   to approximately million for the year ended june  additionally  revenue related to minimum guarantees from microsoft and fdc increased in total by million on a year over year basis 
we have established pricing models that provide volume based discounts to share scale efficiencies with our customers 
as a result of significant transaction growth  our average revenue per transaction has declined by approximately in our transaction based revenue 
historically low interest rates throughout fiscal have also resulted in a dampening of revenue in our interest sensitive products such as abt 
our june   acquisition of aps provided about million of revenue in fiscal growth in our investment services revenue was driven primarily by growth in the number of portfolios managed  from approximately million as of june   to nearly million as of june  economic conditions throughout our fiscal year ended june  resulted in portfolios managed remaining essentially flat at million for the year 
as the stock market rebound progressed into our fiscal year  the number of portfolios we managed increased by about  per quarter 
in some cases  new portfolios are being added to our apl system at a lower average price point  driven by a mix shift as increased volume comes from broker dealers at a lower price  and by price reductions  where we trade off near term revenue growth against long term strategic advantage 
growth in our software business was driven primarily by our acquisition of heliograph in the quarter ended december  while our sales pipeline remains solid  customers continue to take longer to evaluate discretionary software purchases than in prior years 
across all segments of our business  for the year ended june   bank of america generated total revenue of million  which exceeded of our consolidated revenues  and was the only customer that exceeds of our total revenue in fiscal our agreement with bank of america has a ten year term  includes annual minimum guarantees of million  and provides for tiered pricing which reflects the volume of activity provided by bank of america 
the following tables set forth comparative revenues  by type  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
processing and servicing revenue s june  change year ended we earn processing and servicing revenue in both our electronic commerce and our investment services businesses 
while growth in portfolios managed in our investment services business contributed nicely  our increase in processing and servicing revenue has come primarily from the aforementioned growth in transactions processed in our electronic commerce business 
while expected transaction volume diverted from checkfree to in house solutions by four large bank customers had dampened our growth during the transition  growth in the remainder of our electronic commerce business  including the addition 
table of contents of two large bank customers  outpaced diverted transactions 
we delivered approximately million e bills in the year ended june   with an average price point of approximately per e bill  representing an increase of over the million bills delivered during the year ended june  our commercial agreements with microsoft and fdc  resulting from our acquisition of transpoint in september  include monthly minimum revenue guarantees consistent with other consumer service providers 
the minimums for microsoft and fdc increase annually over the five year term of the agreements 
we operated substantially below the minimum revenue levels with both  but as a result of the increased minimum levels  revenue from microsoft and fdc grew by approximately million on a year over year basis 
somewhat offsetting this growth has been a reduction in market demand for our abt products 
finally  contract revisions with bank of america late in the quarter ended december   along with other volume based discounts inherent in our business  further reduced our processing and servicing revenue growth 
license fee revenue s june  change year ended although the software market showed signs of recovery  potential customers continued to extend their evaluation period on discretionary software spending 
therefore  in spite of a strong sales pipeline and the addition of heliograph in november  we incurred a slight decline in license fee revenue on a year over year basis 
maintenance fee revenue s june  change year ended maintenance fee revenue  which represents annually renewable product support for our software customers  is isolated to our software business  and tends to grow with incremental license sales from previous periods 
our maintenance base grew as a result of recent license sales  customer retention rates exceeding  and moderate price increases across all business units  as well as eight months of revenue from the acquisition of heliograph 
other revenue s june  change year ended other revenue consists mostly of consulting and implementation fees across all three of our businesses 
during our fiscal year ending june   we performed a custom software implementation project that generated a significant amount of consulting revenue that did not recur in our fiscal year 
the following set of tables provides line by line expense comparisons with their relative percentages of our consolidated revenues for the years ended june  and  respectively 
cost of processing  servicing and support s june  revenue revenue year ended 
table of contents in electronic commerce  our electronic payment rate increased from as of june   to as of june  electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than paper based payments and are far less likely to result in a costly customer care claim 
in addition to leveraging a significant fixed cost processing infrastructure  we continued to focus investment on additional efficiency and quality improvements within our customer care processes and our information technology infrastructure to drive cost per transaction improvement 
research and development s june  revenue revenue year ended including capitalized development costs of million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june   gross expenditures for research and development were million  or of consolidated revenues  for the year ended june   and were million  or of consolidated revenues for the year ended june  we continued to invest heavily in product enhancement and productivity improvement initiatives in all of our business segments  and we added moderate levels of research and development spending with the acquisition of heliograph 
sales and marketing s june  revenue revenue year ended the decrease in sales and marketing costs  as a percentage of consolidated revenues  is due primarily to the fact that the predominance of our revenue growth took place in our electronic commerce business  which has less associated variable sales commissions 
on an absolute dollar basis  we have incurred less general awareness marketing program expense in fiscal than we had in fiscal however  these expenses have historically fluctuated due to the nature and timing of various programs 
general and administrative s june  revenue revenue year ended the acquisition of heliograph in the quarter ended december   added approximately million of new quarterly general and administrative costs to our cost base 
in the quarter ended march   we incurred approximately million of accrued costs associated with a closed facility in the ann arbor  michigan area 
depreciation and amortization s june  revenue revenue year ended depreciation and amortization expense from operating fixed assets and internally capitalized product costs has decreased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the remainder of our depreciation and amortization costs represents acquisition 
table of contents related amortization 
the decrease in non acquisition related depreciation and amortization is the result of investments in replacement assets that carry lower costs than the assets they are replacing 
the remaining reduction in depreciation and amortization is the result of lower acquisition related intangible amortization from intangible assets that have fully amortized since last year  and the amortization of lower non goodwill intangible assets balances resulting from impairment charges in the prior year 
in process research and development s june  revenue revenue year ended we recorded immaterial in process research and development costs totaling million related to our acquisition of heliograph in the quarter ended december  there were no such costs associated with our acquisition of aps in june impairment of intangible assets s june  revenue revenue year ended throughout fiscal  there were no triggering events that caused us to evaluate the recovery of our intangible asset balances 
in april  we performed our annual evaluation of intangible asset recoverability and our tests provided no indication of possible impairment 
throughout fiscal  there were no triggering events that caused us to evaluate the recoverability of our intangible asset balances 
in april  we performed our annual evaluation of intangible asset recoverability 
our initial tests indicated a potential impairment of goodwill in our checkfree i solutions reporting unit 
our follow up tests included an sfas recoverability test of our technology assets  which indicated no issues  and a sfas test  which resulted in an impairment of million in one of our non goodwill intangible assets 
the final sfas test resulted in a further impairment of million in our checkfree i solutions goodwill balance for a total charge of million 
reorganization charge s june  revenue revenue year ended due primarily to our inability to sublease office space that was abandoned as a result of a prior reorganization  in the quarter ended june   we recorded million of additional reorganization charges to true up our estimates from the actions we initiated in fiscal equity in loss of joint venture s june  revenue revenue year ended in april  we announced a joint venture  onevu  with voca in the united kingdom  designed to create an integrated electronic billing and payment network for billers and banks in the united kingdom

our interest expense decreased significantly on a year over year basis 
we carried our convertible subordinated notes due at a balance of million throughout the year ending june   and through the quarter ended september  we redeemed the notes in full on december  we incurred a cash charge of million for a call premium to redeem the notes prior to their scheduled maturity date  and we incurred a non cash charge of million to write off the remaining unamortized note issuance costs 
loss on investments s june  revenue revenue year ended the fair market value of one of our investments in a private imaging company remained below our book value for an extended period of time 
as a result  we judged this to be an other than temporary decline in the market value based on our evaluation of an expected potential recovery of fair value  and  accordingly  in the quarter ended march   we recorded a charge of million to reflect the loss 
the fair market value of our investment in payment data systems  inc formerly billserv  inc  remained below our book value for an extended period of time 
as a result  we judged this to be an other than temporary decline in the market value based on our evaluation of an expected potential recovery of fair value  and  accordingly  in the quarter ended december   we recorded a charge of million 
the fair market value of this investment continued to decline subsequent to december   and in the quarter ended march   we recorded an additional charge of million 
income tax expense benefit s june  effective effective rate rate year ended we turned profitable for the year ended june  however  because our pre tax income was relatively low for the year  earned tax credits significantly reduced our effective tax rate 

table of contents cumulative effect of accounting change s june  revenue revenue year ended on july   we adopted sfas  which changed the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  as goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
as a result of the transitional impairment test  under sfas  we determined that goodwill associated with our checkfree i solutions reporting unit was impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million  net of tax  which is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  segment information we evaluate the performance of our segments based on revenues and operating income loss of the respective segments

table of contents years ended june  and electronic commerce segment information electronic commerce revenue s june  change year ended revenue growth in electronic commerce was primarily the result of an increase in transactions processed  including those added by our walk in payments business  an increase in e bills distributed  and an increase in revenue from interest sensitive products  such as abt  somewhat offset by volume based price increases 
we offer two general levels of electronic billing and payment services to our customers a full service offering and a payment services offering 
customers that use our full service offering generally outsource their electronic billing and payment process to us 
a full service customer may or may not use a checkfree hosted user interface  but uses a broad array of services  including payment processing  payment warehousing  claims processing  e bill  online proof of payment  various levels of customer care  and other aspects of our service 
while a full service customer may have its own payment warehouse  we maintain a customer record and payment history within our payment warehouse to support the full service customer s servicing needs 
customers in the full service category may contract to pay us either on a per subscriber basis  a per transaction basis  or a blend of both 
the distinction between full service and payment services is based solely on the types of service the customer receives  not on our pricing methodology 
customers that utilize our payment services offering receive a limited subset of our electronic billing and payment services  primarily remittance processing  and includes our walk in payment business 
additionally  within payment services  we provide services to billers for electronic bill delivery  biller direct hosting and payments  as well as other payment services  such as abt 
a third category of revenue we simply refer to as other electronic commerce includes our health and fitness business and other ancillary revenue sources  such as consumer service provider and biller implementation and consulting services and fees associated with the issuance of stored value cards 
the following tables provide an historical trend of revenues  underlying transaction metrics  and subscriber metrics  where appropriate  for our electronic commerce business over the periods presented fiscal quarter ended in millions full service revenue active subscribers transactions processed payment services revenue transactions processed other electronic commerce revenue totals electronic commerce revenue transactions processed 
table of contents fiscal quarter ended in millions full service revenue active subscribers transactions processed payment services revenue transactions processed other electronic commerce revenue totals electronic commerce revenue transactions processed the primary driver behind the increase in full service revenue from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june   was growth in full service transactions processed from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the impact of transaction growth was partially offset by general volume based pricing tier discounts and particularly by a december revision to our contract with our largest customer  bank of america  where subscriber pricing was replaced with transaction based pricing including volume discounts commensurate with this customer s volume 
since june   full service revenue per transaction has declined from to as of june  payment services revenue has increased substantially  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  in addition to growth in transactions processed from our existing customer base  the primary driver of the increase in revenue has been our acquisition of aps on june  this walk in payments business contributed significant transaction volume at a per transaction rate substantially higher than our core payment services business 
the addition of walk in payments can be seen clearly in the increase in both revenue and transactions processed beginning in the quarter ended september   in the historical trends above 
electronic commerce operating income s june  change year ended our ratio of electronic payments to total payments improved from as of june   to as of june  electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than paper payments and are far less likely to result in a costly customer care inquiry or claim 
due to continued improvement in quality and efficiency and the leverage we have experienced in our fixed cost base  we have realized a significant reduction in cost per transaction over the past year  which resulted in an increase in operating income 
despite our new walk in payment operations providing a relatively low operating margin  the overall underlying operating margin in our electronic commerce business has increased from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june  
table of contents investment services segment information investment services revenue s june  change year ended revenue growth in investment services was driven primarily by an increase in portfolios managed  from about million as of june   to million as of june  we have provided certain incentives for customers to sign multi year contracts and are experiencing a mix shift toward lower priced services  both of which we expect to result in lower revenue per average portfolio managed 
growth in portfolios managed is typically tied to the growth in the us stock market 
we have experienced renewed growth in portfolios  and as a result  we are cautiously optimistic about continued near term portfolio growth 
investment services operating income s june  change year ended our underlying operating margin has declined from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june   due primarily to additional spending on the enhanced operating system project  checkfree epl tm enhanced portfolio lifecycle  and an investment in resources designed to improve future operational quality standards through six sigma quality programs 
we expect our future margin to remain around until completion of checkfree epl 
software segment information software revenue s june  change year ended in addition to incremental revenue provided from our acquisitions of heliograph in the quarter ended december   and accurate in the quarter ended june   we experienced moderate revenue growth in our core ach and reconciliation businesses during the year ended june  we believe this to be the combined result of improved execution within the division and early signs of recovery in the us economy 
software operating income s june  change year ended the increase in year over year operating income is due primarily to the acquisitions of heliograph and accurate  but is partially dampened by a million charge due to a loss on a services contract for a large customer during the year 
until higher margin license revenues begin to increase at a greater pace  we would expect operating margins to continue in the low range 

table of contents corporate segment information corporate operating loss s june  change year ended corporate results represent costs for legal  human resources  finance and various other unallocated overhead expenses 
we have been able to leverage our corporate infrastructure by limiting additional costs primarily to increased regulatory efforts associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance 
purchase accounting amortization purchase accounting amortization s june  change year ended purchase accounting amortization represents amortization of intangible assets resulting from our various acquisitions from forward 
despite increased intangible amortization expenses in fiscal related to our aps and accurate acquisitions  the decrease in year over year purchase accounting amortization is the result of older intangible assets that have fully amortized 
we expect a significant decrease in purchase accounting amortization in fiscal as intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of bluegill technologies  inc from fiscal were completely amortized in the quarter ended june   and from our acquisition of transpoint  as these become completely amortized in the quarter ended december  reorganization charge reorganization charge s june  change year ended late in the quarter ended june   we terminated the employment of approximately associates  re scoping many positions with the intent to re hire quickly  and eliminating some others 
as part of this action  we announced that our electronic billing and payment operations in waterloo  ontario  canada  will move to norcross  georgia  and we expect to close the canadian facility in october we do not expect to incur any additional significant charges in the future related to this action 
these actions resulted in a charge of million 
write off of capitalized software write off of capitalized software s june  change year ended as a result of our acquisition of accurate in the quarter ended june   we recorded a charge of million to write down the value of previously capitalized software due to redundancy between existing company products and those acquired 

table of contents in process research development in process research development s june  change year ended we recorded immaterial in process research and development costs totaling million related to our acquisition of heliograph in the quarter ended december  there were no such costs associated with our acquisitions of either aps or accurate 
years ended june  and electronic commerce segment information electronic commerce revenue s june  change year ended revenue growth in electronic commerce was primarily the result of an increase in transactions processed  the addition of two large bank customers  an increase in e bills distributed  and tiered transpoint related revenue minimums  offset by contractual volume based price discounts  four bank customers transferring transaction volume to in house systems  and dampened demand for our abt product offering 
we offer two general levels of electronic billing and payment services to our customers a full service offering and a payment services offering 
customers that use our full service offering generally outsource their electronic billing and payment process to us 
a full service customer may or may not use a checkfree hosted user interface  but uses a broad array of services  including payment processing  payment warehouse  claims processing  e bill  online proof of payment  various levels of customer care  and other aspects of our service 
while a full service customer may have its own payment warehouse  we maintain a customer record and payment history within our payment warehouse to support the full service customer s servicing needs 
customers in the full service category may contract to pay us either on a per subscriber basis  a per transaction basis  or a blend of both 
the distinction between full service and payment services is based solely on the types of service the customer receives  not on our pricing methodology 
customers that utilize our payment services offering receive a limited subset of our electronic billing and payment services  primarily remittance processing 
additionally  within payment services  we provide services to billers for electronic bill delivery  biller direct hosting and payments  as well as other payment services  such as abt 
a third category of revenue we simply refer to as other electronic commerce includes our health and fitness business and other ancillary revenue sources  such as consumer service provider and biller implementation and consulting services 

table of contents the following tables provide a historical trend of revenue  underlying transaction metrics and subscriber metrics  where appropriate  for our electronic commerce business over fiscal and fiscal fiscal quarter ended in millions full service revenue active subscribers transactions processed payment services revenue transactions processed other electronic commerce revenue totals electronic commerce revenue transactions processed fiscal quarter ended in millions full service revenue active subscribers transactions processed payment services revenue transactions processed other electronic commerce revenue non cash revenue impact of warrants totals electronic commerce revenue transactions processed the primary drivers of the increase in full service revenue from fiscal to fiscal  were growth in full service transactions processed of  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june   a million increase in transpoint revenue minimums on a year over year basis  and the addition of two large bank customers since june  growth from the aforementioned sources has been offset by several factors 
since the quarter ended september   two large customers moved full service transaction volume to in house systems 
both banks completed their moves by the quarter ended september  the combination of these moves  price tier discounts earned by our largest customer  bank of america  during the preceding twelve months  additional discounts resulting from our previously mentioned contract amendment with bank of america in the quarter ended december   and general tiered pricing declines across our customer 
table of contents base related to increasing transaction volumes  resulted in full service revenue per transaction declines from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june  in the payment services area  the primary driver of the revenue decline on a year over year basis has been the movement of transactions to in house solutions by two large bank customers since the quarter ended september  the first bank completed its move by december   and the second by the quarter ended december  growth in the remaining payment services businesses surpassed lost volume from these banks as quarterly revenue returned to prior year levels 
the decline in other electronic commerce revenue was due to the loss of a large health and fitness customer and less implementation revenue 
additionally  we recorded a non cash addition to revenue of million in the quarter ended september  related to a true up of a previously recorded charge for warrants issued to a third party 
electronic commerce operating income s june  change year ended our ratio of electronic payments to total payments improved from as of june   to as of june  electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than paper payments and are far less likely to result in a costly customer care inquiry or claim 
due to our continued efforts toward the improvement of quality and efficiency and the leverage we experienced in our fixed cost base  we realized a reduction in our cost per transaction  which resulted in an increase in operating income 
investment services segment information investment services revenue s june  change year ended revenue derived from the volume of portfolios managed began to improve  after several quarters of relatively flat results 
the total number of accounts managed increased from million at june  to about million at june  as the stock market improved  we saw growth in the number of portfolios managed 
we provided certain incentives for customers to sign multi year contracts and experienced a business mix shift toward lower priced services 
investment services operating income s june  change year ended the reduction in operating income was due primarily to added investment in research and development programs to further improve our product offering in the market and efforts to improve our operational quality standards 
software segment information software revenue s june  change year ended 
table of contents with the acquisition of heliograph in november  our efforts in europe with an enterprise reconciliation solution  and new ach software marketed as pep reach tm designed to take advantage of recent check conversion rules and regulations  we experienced an increase in software revenue since the year ended june  however  despite solid sales pipelines and an apparent improvement in economic conditions  customers continued to require an extended evaluation period prior to committing to discretionary software purchases 
software operating income s june  change year ended the decrease in operating income on a year over year basis was due primarily to increased costs associated with the heliograph acquisition in november additionally  we incurred approximately million of accrued costs associated with a closed facility we were unable to sublease in the ann arbor  michigan area 
corporate segment information corporate operating loss s june  change year ended corporate results represent costs for legal  human resources  finance and various other unallocated overhead expenses 
we continued to leverage our infrastructure costs in the face of increasing revenues 
purchase accounting amortization purchase accounting amortization s june  change year ended purchase accounting amortization represents amortization of intangible assets resulting from our various acquisitions from forward 
the decrease in expense on a year over year basis was the result of intangible assets that had fully amortized since june   and the amortization of lower intangible asset balances resulting from impairment charges in the year ended june  impairment of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets s june  change year ended in the quarter ended june   we recorded charges totaling million for the impairment of intangible assets 
our annual review for possible impairment of goodwill  as required by sfas  resulted in a charge of million for the impairment of our customer base intangible asset and another million for the impairment of goodwill  both from intangible assets we established upon the acquisition of bluegill technologies  inc in april 
table of contents reorganization charge reorganization charge s june  change year ended in the year ended june   we incurred a true up reorganization charge of million  due primarily to our inability to sub lease vacated property we abandoned in a restructuring action in the year ended june  because these activities were initiated prior to june   we accounted for these actions in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
impact of warrants impact of warrants s june  change year ended during the quarter ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million against revenue resulting from the probable vesting of warrants issued to a third party 
in the quarter ended september   the warrants vested 
on the date of vesting  the fair value of our stock was lower than at june   when we calculated the initial charge 
as a result  a true up of the value of the warrants resulted in a credit to revenue of million in the quarter ended september  the original charge  and the true up credit  were based on a black scholes valuation of the warrants and were accounted for as a net charge to revenue in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
liquidity and capital resources the following chart provides a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the appropriate periods year ended june  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of june   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand  and an additional million in long term investments 
our consolidated balance sheet reflects a current ratio of and working capital of million 
due primarily to processing efficiency improvement  we experienced a steady increase in net cash provided by operating activities over the past several years 
for the year ended june   we generated million of net cash provided by operating activities 
we expect net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for our fiscal year ending june  due to the payout of annual incentive bonuses and commissions  we expect net cash from operating activities to be relatively low in the quarter ending september  our full year expected increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal represents a modest increase over fiscal due to our becoming a full year cash basis tax payer in fiscal considering our existing cash and invested asset balances  and expectations of net cash provided by 
table of contents operating activities in the near future  we believe we have sufficient cash to meet our presently anticipated requirements for the near term 
our board of directors has approved up to million for the purpose of repurchasing shares of our common stock through july  to the extent we may require additional cash  we have access to an untapped million revolving credit facility 
if we do decide to borrow against this facility  borrowings are subject to periodic payments and bear interest at one of two rates  at our option  either prime plus to or libor plus to 
in addition to customary covenants  which are not expected to significantly affect our operations  our credit facility does not allow the payment of cash dividends on our common stock 
we have no immediate plans to borrow against the credit facility 
from an investing perspective  we used million of cash during the year ended june  we used million for net purchases and sales of investments  million net of cash received for the acquisition of accurate  million for capital expenditures  million for the change in other assets  million in the final settlement of working capital adjustments related to the acquisitions of heliograph and aps  million for our investment in onevu  and million for the capitalization of software development costs 
from a financing perspective  we used million of cash during the year ended june  we used million for the repurchase of  shares of our common stock and million for principal payments under capital leases and other long term obligations 
we received million in combined proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
while the timing of cash payments and collections will cause fluctuations from quarter to quarter and the level of capital expenditures could change  we expect to generate as much as million of free cash flow for the fiscal year ending june  we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities  exclusive of the net change in settlement assets and liabilities  less capital expenditures 
our agreement to use a bank routing number to process payments contains certain financial covenants related to tangible net worth  cash flow coverage  debt service coverage and maximum levels of debt to cash flow  as defined 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of june   and do not anticipate any change in the foreseeable future 
the following table represents a summary of our current contractual obligations and commercial commitments  which may assist in understanding expected cash commitments from various obligations we have entered into over time payments due year ended june  to to contractual obligations total thereafter in thousands operating leases capital lease obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations we anticipate that our cash flows from operations along with our line of credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy these obligations 
use of non gaap financial information we supplement our reporting of cash flow information determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap by using free cash flow in this annual report on form k as a measure to evaluate our liquidity 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities  exclusive of the net change in settlement accounts and less capital expenditures 
we believe free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors in 
table of contents understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance 
we also use free cash flow as a factor in determining long term incentive compensation for senior management 
we exclude the net change in settlement accounts from free cash flow because we believe this facilitates management s and investors ability to analyze operating cash flow trends 
in connection with our walk in payment business  our consolidated balance sheet reflects settlement assets and settlement obligations 
the settlement assets represent payment receipts in transit to us from agents  and the settlement obligations represent scheduled but unpaid payments due to billers 
balances in settlement accounts fluctuate daily based on deposit timing and payment transaction volume 
these timing differences are not reflective of our liquidity  and thus  we exclude the net change in settlement accounts from free cash flow 
as a technology company  we make significant capital expenditures in order to update our technology and to remain competitive 
our free cash flow reflects the amount of cash we generated that remains  after we have met those operational needs  for the evaluation and execution of strategic initiatives such as acquisitions  stock and or debt repurchases and other investing and financing activities  including servicing additional debt obligations 
free cash flow does not solely represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures  as certain of our non discretionary obligations are also funded out of free cash flow 
these consist primarily of payments on capital leases and other long term commitments  if any  as reflected in the table entitled contractual obligations in the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein 
our free cash flow for the years ended june   and june   is calculated as follows in thousands year ended june  cash provided by operating activities excluding net change in settlement accounts less capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities for the years ended june  and june   was million and million  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  our free cash flow should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  net cash provided by operating activities or any other amount determined in accordance with gaap 
further  our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp provides guidance under fas with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fas we have not yet completed our evaluation of the 
table of contents impact of the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
accordingly  as provided for in fsp  we have not adjusted our income tax provision or deferred tax liabilities to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas sfas r  share based payment sfas r  supersedes apb and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and shares purchased under an employee stock purchase plan if certain parameters are not met  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
under our associate stock purchase plan as currently defined  the shares purchased by our employees on june and december of each year would be required to be recorded at fair value within our consolidated financial statements under the guidance of sfas r as our plan offers a discount in excess of 
on april   the securities and exchange commission sec  announced the adoption of a new rule that amended the compliance date of sfas r 
the new rule allows companies to implement sfas r at the beginning of the next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period  beginning after june  for us  the amended effective date did not delay our adoption date 
as a result  we will adopt this statement in the first quarter of our fiscal year quarter ending september  using the modified prospective method 
we are still in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas r will have on our consolidated financial statements 
however  we believe that upon adopting this statement  we will record stock based compensation expense of less than  during the quarter ending september  in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets sfas 
this statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal periods beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued 
we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on july   the fasb issued sfas  business combinations sfas and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june   to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in addition  it requires application of the provisions of sfas for goodwill and other intangible assets related to any business combinations completed after june   but prior to the adoption date of sfas sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
all other acquired intangibles are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  or exchanged  regardless of the company s intent to do so 
other intangibles are amortized over their useful lives 
sfas became effective for us on july   and had the following impacts we reclassified approximately  of unamortized workforce in place intangible assets  net of the associated deferred income taxes  into goodwill 

table of contents after the reclassification above  goodwill was no longer amortized 
we performed a transitional impairment test as of july  this impairment test required that we identified our reporting units  determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units  and determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
if the carrying value of any reporting unit exceeded its fair value  then the amount of any goodwill impairment was determined through a fair value analysis of each of the assigned assets excluding goodwill and liabilities 
we recorded a charge of  for impairment of goodwill associated with our acquisition of bluegill technologies  inc currently referred to as checkfree i solutions upon our adoption of sfas this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june  following the transitional impairment test  our goodwill balances are subject to annual impairment tests using the same process described above 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements where the results of our annual impairment test are discussed 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
discussion with the audit committee of the board of directors 
in determining which of our accounting policies and estimates warranted disclosure as critical in nature  our senior financial management team prepares an analysis of our accounting policies and reviews the policies in detail with our audit committee 
after discussing the level of management judgment required to comply with our accounting policies  the audit committee agrees with us that the following accounting policies are deemed to be critical in nature and should be disclosed as such 
accounting for goodwill 
over the past several years  we have acquired a number of businesses and the electronic billing and payment assets of bank of america  which resulted in significant goodwill balances 
as of june   the balance of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet totaled million and is spread across our three business segments as follows electronic commerce of million  software of million  and investment services of million 
in accordance with fas  we periodically evaluate goodwill for impairment no less than annually by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value using a two step impairment test 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the estimate of a reporting unit s fair value requires the use of assumptions and estimates regarding the reporting unit s future cash flows  growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
assumed growth rates generally ranged from to and varied by reporting unit based upon near and medium term growth opportunities 
the assumed weighted average cost of capital approximated 
any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these 
table of contents businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
we have approximately million of goodwill as of june   none of which is considered impaired  based on recent impairment testing 
given the significance of goodwill  an adverse change to the estimated fair value could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment review on april of each year 
no indicators of impairment were evident during our review for fiscal year intangible assets exclusive of goodwill 
we have recorded intangible assets that were initially recognized as a result of business combinations 
the intangible assets are amortized on a straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate  for impairment  the carrying value of acquired intangible assets by comparing the carrying value to the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the intangible asset 
if an intangible asset is impaired  the asset is written down to fair value 
intangible assets are evaluated in light of actual results from operations and related cash flows to ensure that the carrying value of these intangible assets is recoverable 
significant changes in our results from operations could result in an impairment charge 
we have approximately million of intangible assets  exclusive of goodwill  as of june  given the significance of intangibles  adverse changes to our operations could result in an impairment charge that could be material to the financial statements 
equity instruments issued to customers 
within our electronic commerce segment  from time to time  we have determined it appropriate to issue warrants to certain of our customers to provide an incentive for them to achieve mutually beneficial long term objectives 
these objectives can take the form of performance against long term growth targets  such as the number of the third party s customers that become active bill paying subscribers of our service or the number of bills distributed electronically to the third party s customers 
accounting standards for these types of warrants require us to record a charge when it becomes probable that the warrants will vest 
for milestone based warrants the amount of the charge would be the fair value of the portion of the warrants earned by the customer based on their progress towards achieving the milestone s required to vest in the warrants 
at each reporting date  we would determine the current fair value of the portion of the warrants previously earned and true up the charges previously recorded 
in addition  we would record a charge for the fair value of the additional portion of the warrants earned during that period  again based on the customer s progress towards the vesting milestones 
this would continue until the warrants vest  at which time a final fair value is determined and the charge is adjusted accordingly 
at the time we issued these warrants  accounting standards in place indicated that the charge for these type warrants be recorded as an expense 
since then  the eitf issued eitf this guidance became effective for financial statements issued after december   and is retroactively applied to existing equity instruments previously issued 
it requires that the charge for the fair value of these types of warrants be recorded against revenue up to the cumulative amount of revenue recognized for a customer instead of to expense as was previously the case 
management must use judgment in determining when the vesting of a warrant becomes probable 
as of june   we had five million unvested warrants outstanding that expire in october that could potentially result in a charge against our revenue that could be material to our financial statements 
income taxes and deferred income taxes 
like most companies  domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  including state and local taxes  we record reserves for probable reversals 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
the ultimate resolution of these matters may exceed or be below the amount we have recorded as a reserve 
as of june   we have million of deferred income tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  million of which are recorded in the current asset section of our consolidated balance sheet  
table of contents and million of which are recorded in the long term asset section of our consolidated balance sheet  and million of long term deferred tax liabilities in accordance with gaap 
deferred income tax assets represent future tax benefits we expect to be able to apply against future taxable income 
our ability to utilize the deferred tax benefits is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
sfas  accounting for income taxes requires us to record a valuation allowance against any deferred income tax benefits that we believe may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income to use them 
if we were to record a deferred tax benefit valuation allowance  it would have the effect of increasing our tax expense thereby decreasing our net income and decreasing our deferred tax asset balance on our consolidated balance sheet 
we use current estimates of future taxable income to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
projecting our future taxable income requires us to use significant judgment regarding the expected future revenues and expenses in each of our business segments 
in addition  we must assume that tax laws will not change sufficiently enough to materially impact the expected tax liability associated with our expected taxable income 
as of june   we have determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our foreign tax credits and state net operating loss carry forwards would not be utilized in the future 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance in the amount of million to reduce our net tax credit carry forwards to their estimated net realizable value 
while our current projections indicate we will be able to fully utilize our remaining deferred income tax benefits  should competitive pressures or other business risks result in a significant variance to our projected taxable income  we could be required to establish a valuation allowance for our remaining deferred tax asset balances 
investments 
a large portion of our investments is reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets based on quoted market prices or estimates from independent pricing services 
changes in estimated future cash flows or an issuer s credit quality will result in changes in fair value estimates 
fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and the impact of changes in fair value are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity of our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  fixed maturity securities are subject to our review to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary 
factors we consider in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include whether the decline is substantial  the duration of the decline  generally greater than six months  the reasons for the decline in value  whether it is a credit event or whether it is interest rate related  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that will allow for a recovery in value  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
when it is determined that a decline in value is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security is reduced to its estimated fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
this corresponding charge is referred to as an impairment and is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
the level of impairment losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation have not had a significant impact on our results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk with the acquisition of bluegill technologies  inc in april  we obtained operations in canada  and with the acquisitions of heliograph in november  and accurate in april  we now maintain multiple offices in the united kingdom  as well as offices in luxembourg and australia 
in june  we announced our plans to close our operations in canada effective october as a result  we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we utilize pounds sterling as the functional currency for the united kingdom  the canadian dollar as the functional currency for canada  the euro as the functional currency for luxembourg and the australian dollar as the functional currency for australia 
due to the relatively immaterial nature of the amounts involved  our economic exposure from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates is not significant enough at this time to engage in forward foreign exchange and other similar instruments 
while our international sales represented approximately two percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended june   we market  sell and license our products throughout the world 
as a result  our future revenue could be somewhat affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products 
our exposure to interest rate risk includes the yield we earn on invested cash  cash equivalents and investments and interest based revenue earned on products such as our abt product 
our outstanding lease obligations carry fixed interest rates 
as part of processing certain types of transactions  we earn interest from the time money is collected from our customers until the time payment is made to merchants 
these revenues  which are generated from trust account balances not included in our consolidated balance sheet  are included in processing and servicing revenue 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage the variability of cash flows related to this interest rate sensitive portion of processing and servicing revenue 
accordingly  we enter into interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our interest rate sensitive revenue 
as of june   we entered into interest rate swap transactions totaling million 
the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges  and they are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
because of the high degree of effectiveness between the interest rate swaps and underlying interest rate sensitive revenue  fluctuations in the fair value of the swaps are generally offset by the changes resulting from the variability of cash flows from the underlying interest rate sensitive revenue 
a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of derivatives by about million 
the decline in fair value of the swap would also result in a decrease in net cash inflows from our interest rate swaps 
our investment policy does not allow us to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we maintain a system of internal controls that includes policies and procedures covering the authorization  reporting and monitoring of derivative activity 
further  the policy allows us to enter into derivative contracts only with counter parties that meet certain credit rating and or financial stability criteria 
the counter parties to these contracts are major financial institutions  and we believe the risk of loss is remote
