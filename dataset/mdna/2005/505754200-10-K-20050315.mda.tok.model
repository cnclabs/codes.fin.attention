the company s estimated cash pension contribution is based upon the calculation of the company s independent actuary for there are no calculations beyond the company s actual cash expenditures for post retirement benefits has declined since and is projected to be relatively stable

critical accounting policies deferred income taxes the company has net deferred income tax assets totaling million 
the realization of these assets over time is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in future periods 
the company has net operating loss nol carryforwards that were generated prior to its reorganization pre reorganization completed on april  as well as nol carryforwards that were generated subsequent to reorganization and prior to the ownership change post reorganization  and nol carryforwards generated in through these nols are available to the company to reduce future taxable income 
the net realizable value of the related tax benefit of the nols is approximately million as of december  the amount of the nol carryforwards used through december  total million of the pre reorganization nols and million of the post reorganization nols 
federal nol carryforwards remaining as of december  total million of pre reorganization nols  million of post reorganization nols and million of nols generated in through wisconsin nol carryforwards remaining as of december  total million of pre reorganization nols  million of post reorganization nols and million of nols generated in through the company s ipo in march  created an ownership change as defined by the internal revenue service irs 
this ownership change generated an irs imposed limitation on the utilization of nol carryforwards  generated prior to the ownership change  to reduce future taxable income 
the annual use of the nol carryforwards is limited to the lesser of the company s taxable income or the amount of the irs imposed limitation 
since the ownership change  the total nol available for use is million annually 
to the extent less than million is used in any year  the unused amount is added to and increases the limitation in the succeeding year 
pre reorganization nols are further limited to an annual usage of million 
any unused amount is added to and increases the limitation in the succeeding year 
the pre reorganization nols of million expire as follows  million in and million in the post reorganization nols of million expire in there is no limitation on the usage of the million of nols generated in through and these nols expire in years through because of the annual limitations on the usage of pre reorganization nols and their earlier expiration dates  there is a greater risk of the loss of benefits recorded for these nols 
the net deferred tax asset recorded for the pre reorganization nols approximates million 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
requires establishment of a valuation allowance for all or a part of the nols unless it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in future periods to utilize the nols before they expire 
in determining that realization of the net deferred tax assets was more likely than not  the company gave consideration to a number of factors including its recent earnings history  expectations for earnings in the future  the timing of reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies available to the company and the expiration dates associated with nol carryforwards 
if  in the future  the company determines that it is no longer more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized  a valuation allowance will be established against all or part of the net deferred tax assets with an offsetting charge to the income tax provision 
pensions the company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans plans covering a majority of its employees 
the company contributed million to the plans in in  the company contributed million to the plans which consisted of million in cash and  shares of treasury stock with a fair market value of million 
the company intends to contribute  and million to the plans in  and  respectively 
the company plans on funding those contributions from cash on hand  cash generated from operations  working capital reductions  treasury stock contributions and  if necessary  from the facility 
no calculation has been made for payments into the plans beyond the plans assets are held in a trust and are primarily invested in us government securities  investment grade corporate bonds and marketable common stocks 
a number of the plans hold shares of the company s common stock which comprise less than ten percent of any individual plan s total assets 
the key assumptions the company considers with respect to the assets in the plans and funding the liabilities associated with the plans are the discount rate  the long term rate of return on plans assets  the projected rate of increase in compensation levels and the actuarial estimate of mortality of participants in the plans 
the most sensitive assumption is on discount rate 
for funding purposes  the company s independent actuaries assume an annual long term rate of return on plan assets of 
for the ten year period ending december   the company experienced an annual rate of return on plan assets of 
the discount rate assumption has declined for four consecutive years 
a decrease in the discount rate results in an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation at the measurement date which may also result in an increase in the additional minimum pension liability included as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income 
such a decrease also results in an actuarial loss which is amortized to pension expense in accordance with fasb statement no 
an increase in the discount rate will have the opposite effect in the pension liability and pension expense 
the company bases its discount rate on long maturity aa rated corporate debt securities 
the company cannot predict whether these interest rates will increase or decrease in future years 
goodwill goodwill of million  included in other assets on the company s balance sheets  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets relating to business acquisitions 
it is an asset with an indefinite life and therefore is not amortized to expense 
the company s assessment of fair value takes into account a number of factors including ebitda multiples of transactions in the company s industry as well as fair market value multiples of transactions of similarly situated enterprises 
the company tests the goodwill for impairment at least annually by fair value impairment testing 
no impairments were recognized in or should goodwill become impaired in the future  the amount of impairment will be charged to sg a expense
