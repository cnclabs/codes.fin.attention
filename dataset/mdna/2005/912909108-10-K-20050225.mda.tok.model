steel has approximately  active employees worldwide and provides defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits to approximately  retirees 
domestic integrated producers that have emerged from bankruptcy proceedings and mini mills do not have comparable fixed retiree obligations 
ussk and ussb conduct business primarily in central and western europe and are subject to market conditions in those areas which are influenced by many of the same factors that affect domestic markets  as well as matters peculiar to international markets such as quotas and tariffs 
ussk and ussb are affected by the worldwide overcapacity in the steel industry and the cyclical nature of demand for steel products and the sensitivity of that demand to worldwide general economic conditions 
in particular  ussk and ussb are subject to economic conditions  environmental regulations and political factors in europe  which if changed could negatively affect results of operations and cash flow 
these economic conditions  environmental regulations and political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  currency fluctuations  increased regulation  limits on emissions see environmental matters for a discussion regarding carbon dioxide emissions limits  which are applicable to european union eu member countries  and quotas  tariffs and other protectionist measures 
ussk and ussb are affected by the volatility of raw materials prices 
ussk and ussb are susceptible to these risks as they arise in slovakia and the union of serbia and montenegro  respectively 
ussk is subject to foreign currency exchange risks because its revenues are primarily in euros and its costs are primarily in us dollars and slovak koruna 
ussb is subject to foreign currency exchange risks because its revenues are primarily in euros and serbian dinars and its costs are primarily in us dollars and serbian dinars 
in response to the termination of the us section proceedings  on december   the european commission announced the termination of the definitive safeguard measures imposed on september  the eu safeguard proceedings  which were similar to the section proceedings  involved quota tariff measures restricting the import of certain steel products into the eu 
usse had been impacted by the quota tariff measures on four products non alloy hot rolled coils  hot rolled strip  hot rolled sheet and cold rolled flat products 
annual shipment quotas were set for all four products and tariffs imposed if the quotas were exceeded 
the measures were scheduled to expire on march   however  they would have ceased to impact ussk upon slovakia s accession into the eu  which occurred on may during  safeguard measures  similar to the eu measures  were also imposed by poland on march and hungary on march 
these measures ceased to affect ussk upon eu accession by slovakia  poland and hungary on may  flat rolled the acquisition of the assets of national on may   increased u

the executive environmental committee  which is comprised of officers of u 
s 
steel  is charged with reviewing its overall performance with various environmental compliance programs 
also  u 
s 
steel  largely through the american iron and steel institute  continues its involvement in the development of various air  water and waste regulations with federal  state and local governments concerning the implementation of cost effective pollution reduction strategies 
the domestic businesses of u 
s 
steel are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act caa with respect to air emissions  the clean water act cwa with respect to water discharges  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances 
in addition  all states where u 
s 
steel operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters 
these laws are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for laws such as rcra and the caa have not yet been promulgated or in certain instances are undergoing revision 
these environmental laws and regulations  particularly the caa  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and the cost of compliance for air  water  solid waste and remediation  see item legal proceedings environmental proceedings and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters  litigation and contingencies 
u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet caa obligations  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be adversely affected 
u 
s 
steel believes that its major domestic integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on u 
s 
steel s competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills and some foreign steel producers and producers of materials which compete with steel  which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s 
steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to its prior disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
domestic integrated facilities that have emerged from bankruptcy proceedings  mini mills and other competitors generally do not have similar liabilities

ussk is subject to the laws of slovakia and the european union eu 
the environmental requirements of slovakia and the eu are comparable to domestic environmental standards 
ussk s environmental expenses in included usage fees  permit fees and or penalties totaling approximately million 
there are no legal proceedings pending against ussk involving environmental matters 
ussk also has entered into an agreement with the slovak government to bring its facilities into environmental compliance  and expects to do so by in april  ussk submitted information to the slovak government regarding emissions of carbon dioxide co from u 
s 
steel s plant in kosice 
this information request related to requirements imposed by the european commission ec to establish carbon dioxide emission limits for member countries in preparation for the commencement of co emissions trading in january slovakia was required to submit to the ec for approval a national allocation plan nap specifying its total co allowances in tons of emissions for the period to slovakia submitted its proposed nap to the ec in early july on october   the ec approved an nap for slovakia that reduced slovakia s original proposed co allocation by approximately percent 
on december   ussk filed an application for annulment of the ec s october decision in the court of first 
table of contents instance of the european communities cfi contesting the ec s reduction of slovakia s original proposed nap 
ussk s application requests that the cfi maintain the co emissions allowances granted by the ec s october  decision pending the outcome of this litigation 
on february   ussk was advised informally by the slovak ministry of the environment ministry that it can expect to receive an amount of co allowances for the period to that is approximately percent less than the amount for ussk included in slovakia s proposed nap submitted in july following publication on the ministry web site of the reduced co allowances proposed for individual installations  on february   ussk filed comments with the ministry objecting to any reduction in the co allowances originally requested by ussk 
the slovak minister of environment announced  on february   that slovakia will not challenge at the european court of justice the ec s october decision and that industrial installations in slovakia would receive their co allocations for the period to within a week 
as of the filing of this report on form k  however  ussk had not been advised by the ministry of its co allocation 
the legal action by ussk against the ec will not stay the final decision of the ministry concerning ussk s allowances of co if the expected percent reduction is confirmed by the ministry  there are a number of alternatives available to ussk ranging from the potential purchasing of co allowances to reducing steel production 
the best alternative for ussk may vary depending upon a number of factors and it is not possible at this time to predict the results 
ussb is subject to the laws of the union of serbia and montenegro  which are currently less restrictive than either the eu or us standards  but this is expected to change over the next several years in anticipation of possible eu accession 
an environmental baseline study has been conducted at ussb s facilities 
under the terms of the acquisition  ussb will be responsible for only those costs and liabilities associated with environmental events occurring subsequent to the completion of that study 
the study was completed in june and submitted to the government of serbia in accordance with the terms of the acquisition 
the kyoto global climate change agreement produced by the united nations convention on climate change  which would have required restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the united states  has not been ratified by the us senate  and it appears unlikely that it will be implemented domestically in the near future 
it is unclear what international action will be taken concerning greenhouse gases or the economic impact of such programs  however  inter government discussions continue 
air the caa imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program and enhanced civil and criminal enforcement sanctions 
the principal impact of the caa on u

steel is on the cokemaking and primary steelmaking operations of u 
s 
steel  as described in this section 
the caa requires the regulation of hazardous air pollutants and development and promulgation of maximum achievable control technology mact standards 
it was determined in that the chrome electroplating mact did not apply to steel mill sources  however  the us environmental protection agency epa stated that mact standards applicable to these sources would be forthcoming 
to date  there has been no action taken 
potentially affected u 
s 
steel facilities are the electrolytic tinning lines at gary works and the tin free steel lines at east chicago tin and the midwest plant 
the epa finalized mact standards for integrated iron and steel plants on may   that require compliance by may  the taconite iron ore processing mact was finalized on october   and requires compliance by october  u 
s 
steel anticipates that additional emissions control equipment will be needed to comply with the taconite iron ore processing mact at minntac and keetac 
costs associated with compliance with these mact standards are included in the capital expenditures disclosed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters  litigation and contingencies 
the caa specifically addressed the regulation and control of coke oven batteries 
the national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants for coke oven batteries was finalized in october  setting forth the mact standard and  as an alternative  a lowest achievable emission rate laer standard 
effective january  u 
s 
steel elected to comply with the laer standards 
u 
s 
steel believes it will be able to meet the current laer standards 
the laer standards will be further revised in and additional health risk based standards are expected to be adopted in the epa finalized the phase ii coke mact for pushing  quenching and battery stacks on april   that requires compliance by april  u 
s 
steel is in the process of developing an estimate of the cost to comply 

table of contents in september  the epa adopted revisions to the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter  which are significantly more stringent than prior standards 
the epa is also developing regulations to address regional haze 
the impact of these revised standards could be significant to u 
s 
steel  but the cost cannot be reasonably estimated until the final regulations are promulgated and  more importantly  the states implement their state implementation plans covering their standards

item legal proceedings u 
s 
steel is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment 
certain of these matters are included below in this discussion 
the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to the financial statements 
however  management believes that u 
s 
steel will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably 
asbestos litigation u 
s 
steel is a defendant in approximately active cases  involving approximately  plaintiffs 
many of these cases involve multiple defendants typically from fifty to more than one hundred defendants 
more than  or approximately percent  of these claims are pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
based upon u 
s 
steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
these claims against u 
s 
steel fall into three major groups claims made under certain federal and general maritime laws by employees of the great lakes fleet or intercoastal fleet  former operations of u 
s 
steel  claims made by persons who allegedly were exposed to asbestos at u 
s 
steel facilities referred to as premises claims  and claims made by industrial workers allegedly exposed to products formerly manufactured by u 
s 
steel 
while u 
s 
steel has excess casualty insurance  these policies have multi million dollar self insured retentions 
to date  u 
s 
steel has not received any payments under these policies relating to asbestos claims 
in most cases  this excess casualty insurance is the only insurance applicable to asbestos claims 
these asbestos cases allege a variety of respiratory and other diseases based on alleged exposure to asbestos 
u 
s 
steel is currently a defendant in cases in which a total of approximately plaintiffs allege that they are suffering from mesothelioma 
the potential for damages against defendants may be greater in cases in which the plaintiffs can prove mesothelioma 
in many such cases in which claims have been asserted against u 
s 
steel  the plaintiffs have been unable to establish any causal relationship to u 
s 
steel or its products or premises 
in addition  in many asbestos cases  the plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any identifiable injury or compensable loss at all  that any injuries that they have incurred did in fact result from alleged exposure to asbestos  or that such alleged exposure was in any way related to u 
s 
steel or its products or premises 
in every asbestos case in which u 
s 
steel is named as a party  the complaints are filed against numerous named defendants and generally do not contain allegations regarding specific monetary damages sought 
to the extent that any specific amount of damages is sought  the amount applies to claims against all named defendants and in 
table of contents no case is there any allegation of monetary damages against u 
s 
steel 
historically  approximately percent of the cases against u 
s 
steel stated that the damages sought exceeded the amount required to establish jurisdiction of the court in which the case was filed 
jurisdictional amounts generally range from  to  approximately percent did not specify any damages sought at all  approximately percent alleged damages of million or less  another percent alleged damages between million and million  and percent alleged damages over million 
u 
s 
steel does not consider the amount of damages alleged  if any  in a complaint to be relevant in assessing its potential exposure to asbestos liabilities 
the ultimate outcome of any claim depends upon a myriad of legal and factual issues  including whether the plaintiff can prove actual disease  if any  actual exposure  if any  to u 
s 
steel products  or the duration of exposure to asbestos  if any  on u 
s 
steel s premises 
u 
s 
steel has noted over the years that the form of complaint including its allegations  if any  concerning damages often depends upon the form of complaint filed by particular law firms and attorneys 
often the same damage allegation will be in multiple complaints regardless of the number of plaintiffs  the number of defendants  or any specific diseases or conditions alleged 
u 
s 
steel aggressively pursues grounds for the dismissal of u 
s 
steel from pending cases and litigates cases to verdict where it believes litigation is appropriate 
u 
s 
steel also makes efforts to settle appropriate cases  especially mesothelioma cases  for reasonable  and frequently nominal  amounts 
at december   u 
s 
steel had a total of approximately  active claims outstanding 
in  u 
s 
steel settled  claims for a total of approximately  and had a total of  claims dismissed or otherwise resolved and new claims filed 
at december   u 
s 
steel had a total of approximately  active claims outstanding 
in  except for the aberrant result in the madison county case referred to in the following paragraph  u 
s 
steel settled claims for a total of approximately million  and had a total of  claims dismissed or otherwise resolved and added new cases or  new claims 
at december   u 
s 
steel had a total of approximately  active claims outstanding 
during  u 
s 
steel paid approximately million in settlements 
these settlements and voluntary and involuntary dismissals resulted in the disposition of approximately  claims 
new case filings added  claims 
at december   u 
s 
steel had a total of approximately  active claims outstanding 
on march   a jury in madison county  illinois returned a verdict against u 
s 
steel for million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
u 
s 
steel believes that the court erred as a matter of law by failing to find that the plaintiff s exclusive remedy was provided by the indiana workers compensation law 
u 
s 
steel believes that this issue and other errors at trial would have enabled u 
s 
steel to succeed on appeal 
however  in order to avoid the delay and uncertainties of further litigation and the posting of a large appeal bond in excess of the amount of the verdict  u 
s 
steel settled this case for an amount which was substantially less than the compensatory damages award and which represented a small fraction of the total award 
this settlement is reflected in the results for the quarter ended march   and for the year ended december  management views the verdict and resulting settlement in the madison county case as aberrational  and believes that the likelihood of similar results in other cases is remote  although not impossible 
u 
s 
steel has not experienced any material adverse change in its ability to resolve pending claims as a result of the madison county settlement 
the amount u 
s 
steel has accrued for pending asbestos claims is not material to u 
s 
steel s financial position 
u 
s 
steel does not accrue for unasserted asbestos claims because it believes it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable with respect to such claims or even to estimate the amount or range of any possible losses 
among the reasons that u 
s 
steel cannot reasonably estimate the number and nature of claims against it is that the vast majority of pending claims against it allege so called premises liability based exposure on u 
s 
steel s current or former premises 
these claims are made by an indeterminable number of people such as truck drivers  railroad workers  salespersons  contractors and their employees  government inspectors  customers  visitors and even trespassers 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  and although u 
s 
steel s results of operations and cash flows for a given period could be adversely affected by asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
among the factors considered in reaching this conclusion are that 
table of contents u 
s 
steel has been subject to a total of approximately  asbestos claims over the past years that have been administratively dismissed or are inactive due to the failure of the plaintiffs to present any medical evidence supporting their claims  that over the last several years  the total number of pending claims has generally declined  that it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals  including such matters since the madison county jury verdict and settlement in march the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
environmental proceedings the following is a summary of the proceedings of u 
s 
steel that were pending or contemplated as of december   under federal and state environmental laws 
except as described herein  it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
cercla remediation sites claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites 
cercla is intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault 
potentially responsible parties prps for each site include present and former owners and operators of  transporters to and generators of the substances at the site 
liability is strict and can be joint and several 
because of various factors including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred  it is impossible to reasonably estimate u 
s 
steel s ultimate cost of compliance with cercla 
projections  provided in the following paragraphs  of spending for and or timing of completion of specific projects are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions including  but not limited to  the factors provided in the preceding paragraph 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future spending for  or timing of completion of environmental projects may differ materially from what was stated in forward looking statements 
at december   u 
s 
steel had been identified as a prp at a total of cercla sites 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that u 
s 
steel s liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with of these sites will be between  and million per site  and for of these sites will be under  at the remaining two sites  management expects that u 
s 
steel s share in the remaining cleanup costs at each site will exceed million  although it is not possible to accurately predict the amount of sharing in any final allocation of such costs 
the following is a summary of the status of these sites in  u 
s 
steel and two other prps bethlehem steel corporation and william fiore agreed to the issuance of an administrative order by the us environmental protection agency epa to undertake emergency removal work at the municipal industrial disposal co 
site in elizabeth  pa 
the cost of such removal  which has been completed  was approximately million  of which u 
s 
steel paid million 
epa indicated that further remediation of this site would be required 
in october  the pennsylvania department of environmental resources pader placed the site on the pennsylvania state superfund list and began a remedial investigation ri  which was issued in after a feasibility study fs by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep and submission of a conceptual remedial action plan in by u

steel is responsible 
table of contents for remediation of this site 
on march   padep notified u 
s 
steel that the public comment period was concluded and the consent order and agreement is final 
u 
s 
steel estimates its future liability at the site to be million 
in november  u 
s 
steel received a cercla e request from epa requesting information on the former waste oil processing site named breslube penn located in coraopolis  pa 
u 
s 
steel joined a prp group and entered into an administrative order on consent along with six other prps to conduct a ri fs 
the ri has been completed and the fs  which was submitted to epa  is currently being reviewed by epa and padep 
the total cost to implement a remediation project based on the group s selection from the range of alternatives presented in the fs is estimated to be million 
of that total  u 
s 
steel s allocable share among the eight prps is approximately million 
in addition  u 
s 
steel s share of prp group costs is expected to be less than  in in addition  there are sites related to u 
s 
steel where information requests have been received or there are other indications that u 
s 
steel may be a prp under cercla  but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or to make any judgment as to the amount thereof 
other remediation activities the following is a discussion of other remediation activities at the major domestic u 
s 
steel facilities there are additional sites related to u 
s 
steel where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with of these sites will be under  per site  another sites have potential costs between  and million per site  and sites may involve remediation costs between million and million 
another sites  including the grand calumet river remediation at gary works  the closure of hazardous waste sites at gary works  the claim for investigation  restoration and compensation of injuries to sediments in the east branch of the grand calumet river near gary works  and corrective action and groundwater investigation at gary works  have or are expected to have costs for remediation  investigation  restoration or compensation in excess of million 
potential costs associated with remediation at the remaining sites are not presently determinable

overview u 
s 
steel is the second largest integrated steel producer in north america and has a broad and diverse mix of products and customers 
u 
s 
steel uses iron ore  coal  coke  and steel scrap to produce a wide range of steel products  concentrating on value added steel products for customers with demanding technical applications in the automotive  appliance  container  industrial machinery  construction and oil and gas industries 
in addition to its domestic facilities  u 
s 
steel has significant operations in central europe through u 
s 
steel kosice ussk  located in slovakia  and u 
s 
steel balkan ussb  located in serbia 
u 
s 
steel s financial results are primarily determined by the combined effects of shipment volume  selling prices  production costs  and value added product mix  since these products typically provide a higher profit margin than more commodity type steel products 
the primary drivers for u 
s 
steel are economic conditions in the united states  europe and  to a lesser extent  other steel consuming regions  the levels of worldwide steel production and consumption  pension and other postretirement benefits opeb costs  and raw material iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc and tin and energy natural gas and electricity costs 
u 
s 
steel s long term success depends on its ability to implement the strategy described below 
some of the other key issues which will impact the global steel industry  and u 
s 
steel in particular  include the sustainability of higher steel prices  the steep increase in the cost of purchased raw materials  the level of unfunded pension and opeb liabilities  the magnitude and durability of the world economic recovery  and the impact of production and consumption of steel in china  which has led to much of the recent volatility in steel raw material supplies and global steel pricing 
steel imports to the united states increased significantly during and could continue to increase depending on the relative strength of the us dollar  market pricing  and consumption in the united states versus other regions 
strategy u 
s 
steel s business strategy is to continue to grow its investment in high end finishing assets  expand its global business platform  reduce its costs and become a world leader in safety performance 
in north america  u 
s 
steel is focused on providing value added steel products to its target markets where management believes that u 
s 
steel s leadership position  production and processing capabilities and technical service provide a competitive advantage 
these products include advanced high strength steel and coated sheets for the automotive and appliance industries  sheets for the manufacture of motors and electrical equipment  galvanized and galvalume sheets for the construction industry  improved tin mill products for the container industry and oil country tubular goods 
u 
s 
steel continues to enhance its value added businesses through the upgrading and modernization of its key production facilities 
u 
s 
steel continues to be interested in participating in further consolidation of the north american steel industry if it would be beneficial to customers  shareholders  creditors and employees 
u 
s 
steel continues to explore additional opportunities for steel and raw materials investments in europe 
u 
s 
steel s strategy is to be a leading european steel producer and the prime supplier of steel to growing 
table of contents european markets  to grow its customer base in europe by providing reliable delivery of high quality steel and to invest in value added facilities  including a planned automotive hot dip galvanizing line  to improve usse s product mix 
expansion opportunities in europe and north america would be attractive to u 
s 
steel 
south america  china and india are also possible areas of interest 
in  u 
s 
steel concentrated on successfully integrating the businesses acquired in discussed below  improving its balance sheet  increasing liquidity and continuing to strengthen its core steel businesses in order to be better positioned for further expansion and continued improvements to its existing facilities 
an equity offering of million common shares was completed in march for net proceeds of million  which were primarily used to redeem certain senior notes 
in april  u 
s 
steel redeemed million principal amount of its senior notes  resulting in a reduction of the principal amount outstanding to million  and redeemed million principal amount of its senior notes  resulting in a reduction of the principal amount outstanding to million 
in addition  ussk retired million of long term debt in in total these debt repayments reduced annualized interest expense by approximately million 
also during  u 
s 
steel made voluntary contributions of million to its main domestic defined benefit pension plan and million to a voluntary employee benefit association trust 
in october  u 
s 
steel s million revolving credit facility was amended and restated to extend the maturity to october  increase the borrowing base  reduce the pricing for both borrowings and undrawn commitments  and limit the application of many of the restrictive covenants 
in february  u 
s 
steel continued to divest its non core assets when it sold substantially all of the remaining mineral interests administered by the real estate segment for million 
in  u 
s 
steel engaged in several significant transactions aimed at strengthening its core steel businesses 
on may   u 
s 
steel acquired out of bankruptcy substantially all of the integrated steelmaking assets of national steel corporation national 
see note to the financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition 
the facilities that were acquired included two integrated steel plants  granite city works in granite city  illinois  and great lakes works in ecorse and river rouge  michigan  the midwest plant in portage  indiana  procoil company llc procoil in canton  michigan  a percent equity interest in double g coatings company  lp double g near jackson  mississippi  the iron ore pellet operations in keewatin  minnesota keetac  and the delray connecting railroad company delray in michigan 
this acquisition increased annual domestic raw steel production capability by million net tons tons to million tons 
u 
s 
steel and the united steelworkers of america uswa reached a five year labor agreement that was effective upon the completion of the national acquisition and which covers both u 
s 
steel and former national employees 
this agreement allowed for a workforce restructuring aimed at achieving a percent productivity improvement  expanded profit based variable compensation  provided cost sharing mechanisms for employee and retiree health care expenses  and provided a joint mechanism to consider further acquisitions of steel and steel related assets in north america 
on september   u 
s 
steel acquired out of bankruptcy sartid ad in bankruptcy  an integrated steel company located in the union of serbia and montenegro  and certain of its subsidiaries collectively  sartid 
u 
s 
steel is operating these facilities as ussb

steel contributed timber cutting rights with an appraised value of million to its defined benefit pension plan 
straightline source straightline was closed to new business effective december   and was shut down in critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of u 
s 
steel s financial condition and results of operations is based upon u 
s 
steel s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year 
management regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for deferred income taxes  potential tax deficiencies  environmental obligations  potential litigation claims and settlements  and assets and obligations related to employee benefits 
management estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
pensions and opeb the recording of net periodic benefit costs credits for defined benefit pensions and opeb are based on  among other things  assumptions of the expected annual return on plan assets  discount rate  escalation or other changes in retiree health care costs and plan participation levels 
changes in the assumptions or differences between actual and expected changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of u 
s 
steel s plans could cause net periodic benefit costs to increase or decrease materially from year to year as discussed below 
u 
s 
steel bases its estimate of the annual expected return on plan assets on the historical long term rate of return experienced by u 
s 
steel s plan assets  the investment mix of plan assets between debt  equities and other investments  and its view of market returns expected in the future 
based on a review of these factors  u 
s 
steel has kept the expected annual return on pension plan assets for its main pension plan at percent for net periodic pension cost  excluding multiemployer plans  is expected to total million in a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets for would have decreased or increased  respectively  the expected net periodic pension cost by million 
u 
s 
steel determines the discount rate applied to pension and opeb obligations at each year end or required interim period based on a number of external barometers used to measure the status of high quality bond rates consistent with the expected payout period of the obligations 
based on this evaluation at december   u 
s 
steel lowered the discount rate used to measure both pension and opeb obligations from percent to percent 
lower discount rates increase the actuarial losses of the plans and will unfavorably impact net periodic benefit costs by approximately million for pensions in principally due to the impact of required amortization amounts 
total opeb costs in are expected to be approximately million 
a percentage point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the estimated net periodic pension and opeb costs by approximately million and million  respectively 
a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the estimated net periodic pension and opeb costs by approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   a percentage point increase in the discount rate would have decreased pension and opeb liabilities by million and million  respectively 
a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased pension and opeb liabilities by million and million  respectively 
u 
s 
steel determines the escalation trend in per capita health care costs based on historical rate experience under u 
s 
steel s insurance plans 
assumed health care cost trend rates no longer have a significant effect on 
table of contents the amounts reported for u 
s 
steel s health care plans  other than the benefit plan offered to retired mineworkers  since a cost cap was negotiated in with the uswa  which freezes steelworker retiree medical costs after the base year 
most salaried benefits are limited to flat dollar payments that are not affected by escalation 
for measurement purposes  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
a percentage point increase in the escalation trend would have increased expected net periodic opeb costs by approximately million in a percentage point decrease in the escalation trend would have decreased expected net periodic opeb costs by approximately million in changes in the assumptions for expected annual return on plan assets and the discount rate do not impact the funding calculations used to derive minimum funding requirements for the pension plans 
for further cash flow discussion  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition  cash flows and liquidity liquidity 
asset impairments asset impairments are recognized when the carrying value of those productive assets exceeds their aggregate projected undiscounted cash flows 
these undiscounted cash flows are based on management s long range estimates of market conditions and the overall performance associated with the individual asset or asset grouping 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if the probability of disposition of the assets differs from that previously estimated by management  additional asset write downs may be required 
taxes u 
s 
steel records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should u 
s 
steel determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of net foreign deferred tax assets recorded as of december   was million  net of an established valuation allowance of million 
see note to the financial statements 
u 
s 
steel expects to generate future taxable income to realize the benefits of these net deferred tax assets 
u 
s 
steel makes no provision for deferred us and certain foreign income taxes on the undistributed earnings of ussk and other consolidated foreign subsidiaries because management intends to permanently reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
while u 
s 
steel is currently studying the impact of the one time favorable foreign dividend provisions recently enacted as part of the american jobs creation act of  as of december  and based on the tax laws in effect at that time  it was u 
s 
steel s intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest undistributed foreign earnings and  accordingly  no deferred tax liability has been recorded in connection therewith 
undistributed foreign earnings at december  amounted to approximately million 
if such earnings were not permanently reinvested  a us deferred tax liability of approximately million would be required 
u 
s 
steel records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on management s judgment of the risk of loss should those items be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that tax related items would not be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered potential tax deficiencies as a result of an audit  tax ruling or other positions or authority  an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
environmental remediation u 
s 
steel provides for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
u 
s 
steel regularly monitors the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 
as of december   total accruals for environmental remediation were million  excluding liabilities related to asset retirement obligations under statement of financial accounting standards fas no

the slovak income tax act provides an income tax credit  which is available to ussk if certain conditions are met 
in order to claim the tax credit in any year  percent of ussk s sales must be export sales and ussk must reinvest the tax credits claimed in qualifying capital expenditures during the five years following the year in which the tax credit is claimed 
the provisions of the slovak income tax act permit ussk to claim a tax credit of percent of ussk s tax liability for years through and percent of the current statutory rate of percent for the years through management believes that ussk fulfilled all of the necessary conditions for claiming the tax credit for the years for which it was claimed and anticipates meeting such requirements in as a result of claiming these tax credits and management s intent to reinvest earnings in foreign operations  virtually no income tax provision  except for the two million tax payments discussed below  is recorded for ussk income 
in connection with slovakia joining the european union eu  the total tax credit granted to ussk for the period through was limited to million  and ussk agreed to make tax payments of million in and  the first of which was paid in june also  additional conditions for claiming the tax credit were established 
these new conditions limit ussk s annual production of flat rolled product and its sales of all products into the countries that were members of the eu prior to slovakia and other nations joining the eu in may management believes the future impact of these changes will be minimal because slovak tax laws have been modified and tax rates have been reduced since the acquisition of ussk  and the production and sales limits  which provide for annual increases through  are not materially burdensome

the valuation allowance for domestic taxes was reversed through equity in at december   the amount of net foreign deferred tax assets recorded was million  net of an established valuation allowance of million 
net foreign deferred tax assets will fluctuate as the value of the us dollar changes with respect to the slovak koruna 
a full valuation allowance is recorded for serbian deferred tax assets due to the lack of historical information and the losses experienced in the months immediately following the acquisition of ussb 
if ussb continues to generate income  the valuation allowance of million for serbian taxes could be partially or fully reversed at such time that it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
management will continue to monitor and assess taxable income  deferred tax assets and tax planning strategies to determine the need for  and the appropriate amount of  any valuation allowance

steel accrues an annual cost for these benefit obligations under plans covering its active and retiree populations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these obligations will require corporate cash in future years to the extent that trust assets are restricted or insufficient and to the extent that company contributions are required by law or union labor agreement 
amounts in the years through reflect our current estimate of corporate cash outflows and are net of the projected use of funds available from asset trusts 
the accuracy of this forecast of future cash flows depends on various factors such as actual asset returns  the mix of assets within the asset trusts  medical escalation and discount rates used to calculate obligations  the availability of surplus pension assets allowable for transfer to pay retiree medical claims and company decisions or voluntary employee benefit association restrictions that impact the timing of the use of trust assets 
also  as such  the amounts shown could differ significantly from what is actually expended and  at this time  it is impossible to make a reliable prediction of cash requirements beyond five years 
g amount of contractual cash obligations is not determinable because other post retirement benefit cash obligation estimates are not reliable beyond five years  as discussed in f above

steel management believes that u 
s 
steel s liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future  including obligations to complete currently authorized capital spending programs 
future requirements for u 
s 
steel s business needs  including the funding of acquisitions and capital expenditures  scheduled debt maturities  contributions to employee benefit plans  and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies  are expected to be financed by a combination of internally generated funds including asset sales  proceeds from the sale of stock  borrowings  refinancings and other external financing sources 
increases in interest rates can increase the cost of future borrowings and make it more difficult to raise capital 
this opinion is a forward looking statement based upon currently available information 
to the extent that operating cash flow is materially lower than current levels or external financing sources are not available on terms competitive with those currently available  future liquidity may be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements in  u

environmental matters  litigation and contingencies u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet clean air act obligations  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that its major domestic integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on u 
s 
steel s competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills and some foreign steel producers and producers of materials which compete with steel  which may not be required 
table of contents to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods

steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to its prior disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
domestic integrated facilities that have emerged from bankruptcy proceedings  mini mills and other competitors generally do not have similar liabilities 
ussk is subject to the laws of slovakia and the european union eu 
the environmental requirements of slovakia and the eu are comparable to domestic environmental standards

this information request related to requirements imposed by the european commission ec to establish carbon dioxide emission limits for member countries in preparation for the commencement of co emissions trading in january slovakia was required to submit to the ec for approval a national allocation plan nap specifying its total co allowances in tons of emissions for the period to slovakia submitted its proposed nap to the ec in early july on october   the ec approved an nap for slovakia that reduced slovakia s original proposed co allocation by approximately percent 
on december   ussk filed an application for annulment of the ec s october decision in the court of first instance of the european communities cfi contesting the ec s reduction of slovakia s original proposed nap 
ussk s application requests that the cfi maintain the co emissions allowances granted by the ec s october  decision pending the outcome of this litigation 
on february   ussk was advised informally by the slovak ministry of the environment ministry that it can expect to receive an amount of co allowances for the period to that is approximately percent less than the amount for ussk included in slovakia s proposed nap submitted in july following publication on the ministry web site of the reduced co allowances proposed for individual installations  on february   ussk filed comments with the ministry objecting to any reduction in the co allowances originally requested by ussk 
the slovak minister of environment announced  on february   that slovakia will not challenge at the european court of justice the ec s october decision and that industrial installations in slovakia would receive their co allocations for the period to within a week 
as of the filing of this report on form k  however  ussk had not been advised by the ministry of its co allocation 
the legal action by ussk against the ec will not stay the final decision of the ministry concerning ussk s allowances of co if the expected percent reduction is confirmed by the ministry  there are a number of alternatives available to ussk ranging from the potential purchasing of co allowances to reducing steel production 
the best alternative for ussk may vary depending upon a number of factors and it is not possible at this time to predict the results

u 
s 
steel is a defendant in approximately active asbestos cases  involving approximately  plaintiffs 
many of these cases involve multiple defendants typically from fifty to more than one hundred defendants 
more than  or approximately percent  of these claims are pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
based upon u 
s 
steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
while u 
s 
steel has excess casualty insurance  these policies have multi million dollar self insured retentions 
to date  u 
s 
steel has not received any payments under these policies relating to asbestos claims 
in most cases  this excess casualty insurance is the only insurance applicable to asbestos claims 
on march   a jury in madison county  illinois returned a verdict against u 
s 
steel for million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
u 
s 
steel believes that the court erred as a matter of law by failing to find that the plaintiff s exclusive remedy was provided by the indiana workers compensation law 
u 
s 
steel believes that this issue and other errors at trial would have enabled u 
s 
steel to succeed on appeal 
however  in order to avoid the delay and uncertainties of further litigation and the posting of a large appeal bond in excess of the amount of the verdict  u 
s 
steel settled this case for an amount which was substantially less than the compensatory damages award and which represented a small fraction of the total award 
this settlement is reflected in the results for the quarter ended march  management views the verdict and resulting settlement in the madison county case as aberrational  and believes that the likelihood of similar results in other cases is remote  although not impossible 
u 
s 
steel has not experienced any material adverse change in its ability to resolve pending claims as a result of the madison county settlement 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  and although u 
s 
steel s results of operations and cash flows for a given period could be adversely affected by asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on u 
s 
steel s financial condition 
among the factors considered in reaching this conclusion are that u 
s 
steel has been subject to a total of approximately  asbestos claims over the past years that have been administratively dismissed or are inactive due to the failure of the plaintiffs to present any medical evidence supporting their claims  that over the last several years  the total number of pending claims has generally declined  that it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured electric cable  and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals  including such matters since the madison county jury verdict and settlement in march the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
u 
s 
steel is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment  certain of which are discussed in note to the financial statements 
the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to the u

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments u 
s 
steel uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its price risk 
management has authorized the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options to manage exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase of natural gas  heating oil and nonferrous metals and also certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
derivative instruments used for trading and other activities are marked to market and the resulting gains or losses are recognized in the current period in income from operations 
while u 
s 
steel s risk management activities generally reduce market risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for raw material purchases and products sold  such activities can also encompass strategies that assume price risk 
management believes that the use of derivative instruments  along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls  does not expose u 
s 
steel to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect u

steel s non derivative financial instruments is provided in the following table dollars in millions as of december non derivative financial instruments a fair value b incremental increase in fair value c fair value b incremental increase in fair value c financial assets investments and long term receivables d financial liabilities long term debt e f a fair values of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  notes payable  accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short term maturity of the instruments 
accordingly  these instruments are excluded from the table 
b see note to the financial statements for carrying value of instruments 
c reflects  by class of financial instrument  the estimated incremental effect of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates at december   and december   on the fair value of u 
s 
steel s non derivative financial instruments 
for financial liabilities  this assumes a percent decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of u 
s 
steel s long term debt at december   and december  d for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
e includes amounts due within one year 
f fair value was based on market prices where available  or estimated borrowing rates for financings with similar maturities 
for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
at december   u 
s 
steel s portfolio of long term debt was comprised primarily of fixed rate instruments 
therefore  the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations 
this sensitivity is illustrated by the million increase in the fair value of long term debt assuming a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates 
however  u 
s 
steel s sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases 
table of contents in the fair value of its debt portfolio would unfavorably affect u 
s 
steel s results and cash flows only to the extent that u 
s 
steel elected to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its fixed rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value 
foreign currency exchange rate risk u 
s 
steel  primarily through usse  is subject to the risk of price fluctuations due to the effects of exchange rates on revenues and operating costs  firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than us dollars  in particular the euro  the slovak koruna and the serbian dinar 
u 
s 
steel has not generally used derivative instruments to manage this risk 
however  u 
s 
steel has made limited use of forward currency contracts to manage exposure to certain currency price fluctuations 
at december   u 
s 
steel had open euro forward sale contracts for both us dollars total notional value of approximately million and slovak koruna total notional value of approximately million 
a percent increase in the december  euro forward rates would result in a million charge to income 
safe harbor u 
s 
steel s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward looking statements with respect to management s opinion about risks associated with u 
s 
steel s use of derivative instruments 
these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for steel products and certain raw materials 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future outcomes with respect to u 
s 
steel s hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements
