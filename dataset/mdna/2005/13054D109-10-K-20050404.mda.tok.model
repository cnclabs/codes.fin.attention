item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of financial statements on february   the office of the chief accountant of the sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa expressing its views regarding certain lease related accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
following the release of the sec letter  many restaurant companies and retailers reviewed their previous interpretations of these lease accounting issues and announced that they would restate their results for previous periods 
on march   management and the audit committee of the board of directors concluded that certain of our historical methods of accounting for operating leases were not in accordance with gaap  and we would restate certain of our previously issued consolidated financial statements 
we had historically recognized rent expense for our operating leases using a lease term that commenced when actual rent payments began  and generally coincided with a point in time near the date our restaurants opened 
this generally had the effect of excluding the build out period of our restaurants which typically preceded the commencement of the lease term from the calculation of the period over which rent was expensed 
as a result of our review of the sec s guidance provided in the february  letter and financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with schedule rent increases  we will now recognize rent over a lease term that includes the build out period 
in addition  we will now capitalize rent during the build out period as a cost of constructing the related leasehold improvements 
rent from the date the premises are ready for their intended use through the restaurant opening date are included as rent expense in pre opening expenses 
further  in prior periods  consolidated balance sheets reflected the unamortized portion of tenant improvement allowances funded by landlords as a reduction of the related leasehold improvements 
in keeping with the sec s february  letter and fasb technical bulletin no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  tenant improvement allowances will now be recognized as deferred rent credits and amortized over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense on the consolidated statements of income and as a component of operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
prior to the issuance of this guidance by the sec  we followed common industry practice in the restaurant and retail industries in our lease accounting practices 
these specific lease accounting practices were established early in our history and have always received unqualified audit opinions 
ernst young llp has been our independent auditors since and previously issued unqualified audit opinions on our financial statements 
prior to the sec letter  neither management  nor the audit committee of the board of directors  had ever received any comment that would cause us to question our accounting for leases with respect to these issues 
management and the audit committee reacted promptly and diligently to assess the impact of the sec s february  letter and concluded that restatement of prior years results would be required 
we did not amend our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the restatement  and the financial statements and related financial information contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon 
prior to the sec s issuance of the february  letter  we issued a press release on february  setting forth our unaudited consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended january  the net earnings reported on the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended january  contained in this annual report on form k is higher than the previously issued unaudited results by  resulting in no change to diluted earnings per share 
this increase resulted from the change in accounting for operating leases associated with the holiday rent and tenant improvement allowance restatements noted above  the accrual of additional management bonuses related to performance in the fiscal year  and the accrual of additional audit and legal fees associated with the restatement 

table of contents see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a summary of the effects of these changes on the company s consolidated balance sheets as of december   as well as on the company s consolidated statements of income  stockholders equity and statements of cash flows for fiscal years and the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
overview as of april   we own  license or franchise restaurants in states  the district of columbia and five foreign countries  of which are company owned and operate under the names california pizza kitchen and california pizza kitchen asap  and the remaining of which operate under franchise or license arrangements 
during our years of operating history  we believe we have developed strong brand awareness and demonstrated the appeal of our concept in a wide variety of geographic areas 
our concept was  and remains  to take our customers favorite food cravings and put them on a pizza to figuratively put the world on a pizza 
we opened our first casual dining restaurant in in beverly hills  california and grew steadily to restaurants by early our concept  with its signature line of innovative  premium pizzas  open flame ovens in exhibition style kitchens and excellent guest service  attracted pepsico  inc pepsico  which bought a controlling interest in our company in may during the approximate five year period when pepsico was our controlling stockholder  we opened restaurants  of which were subsequently closed 
we experimented with different locations and different restaurant sizes  ranging from  square feet to more than  square feet 
our rapid expansion strained our infrastructure  resulted in a variety of management and operational changes  diverted our attention from the execution of our concept and led to disappointing operating results and financial performance  including a decline in comparable restaurant sales in at the end of  pepsico concluded that it would sell or otherwise divest all of its restaurant businesses  including california pizza kitchen 
in september  we consummated a series of transactions to effect a merger and leveraged recapitalization through which an investor group led by bruckmann  rosser  sherrill co  lp acquired pepsico s interest in our company 
in  we instituted an accelerated growth plan  focusing largely on further penetrating our existing markets 
between january and december  we opened new company owned  full service restaurants and three asap restaurants 
in july  richard rosenfield and larry flax  co founders and co chairmen of the board  reassumed the responsibilities of co chief executive officers 
in connection with this management change  we reviewed our restaurant portfolio  as well as our operations and growth strategy  and decided to slow down our new restaurant opening schedule  emphasizing quality and profitability 
in we introduced our new prototype full service restaurant  which is larger than our former prototype 
the new prototype is approximately  to  square feet  has approximately indoor and outdoor seats and has been designed to create a more comfortable experience that will enhance our dinner business 
these new restaurants will require on average a higher net investment than historical restaurants 
however  we expect corresponding sales to be higher and ultimately generate a higher restaurant return on investment 
pre opening expenses for each of these new restaurants is expected to range from approximately  to  pre opening costs now include rent expense incurred from the time the restaurant build out period is complete  and the restaurant is ready for its intended use  through the restaurant opening date 
this is an increase from previous estimates that totaled  newly opened restaurants experience higher cost of sales  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs for approximately their first to days of operations in both percentage and dollar terms when compared with our mature restaurants 
accordingly  the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had  and is 
table of contents expected to continue to have  an impact on pre opening expenses  cost of sales  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs until our restaurant operating base is large enough to mitigate these opening costs and inefficiencies 
our revenues are comprised of restaurant sales  franchise royalties and other income 
our restaurant sales are comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales 
our franchise royalties and other revenues consist primarily of monthly royalty income  initial franchise fees and license fees from our trademark license agreement with kraft 
cost of sales is comprised of food  beverage and paper supply expenses 
the components of cost of sales are variable and increase with sales volume 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  bonuses and taxes and benefits for restaurant employees 
direct operating and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  marketing costs  fixed rent  percentage rent  common area maintenance charges  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related restaurant costs 
direct operating and occupancy costs generally increase with sales volume but decline as a percentage of restaurant sales 
general and administrative costs include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries and related employee benefits  travel and relocation costs  information systems  training  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees 
depreciation and amortization principally include depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants 
pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of hiring and training the initial work force  travel  the cost of food used in training  marketing costs  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a restaurant 
in calculating comparable company owned restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for months 
as of january   we had full service company owned restaurants that met this criterion 
in addition  we have included the month comparable base in our management discussion and analysis 
as of january   we had full service company owned restaurants that met this criterion

table of contents in line with the company s continuing effort to increase transparency and as a result of variations in performance among our restaurants opened within the past three years when compared to our more mature restaurants  we now present supplemental operating data for our restaurants which has been grouped according to class in an effort to better clarify unit level economics

depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation of five restaurants in three newly opened restaurants  and the purchase of two previously franchised restaurants during the first quarter of and revised estimates of useful lives which accelerated the depreciation on certain restaurant assets targeted for remodels 
additionally  we revised the estimated useful life of our current point of sale system which will be replaced by a new system in the first half of the new point of sale system is expected to increase information flow which is forecasted to allow operations to manage the business with greater precision and accuracy 
the accelerated depreciation due to the remodels and the point of sale replacement was million  compared to no accelerated depreciation in the prior year

table of contents conditions 
in the past we have experienced significant variability in pre opening costs from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations are primarily a function of the timing of restaurant openings 
we typically incur the most significant portion of pre opening costs associated with a given restaurant in the month of opening 
in addition  our experience to date has been that labor and direct operating and occupancy costs associated with a newly opened restaurant during the first three to four months of operation are often materially greater than what will be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales 
accordingly  the number and timing of new restaurant openings in any quarter has had  and is expected to continue to have  a significant impact on quarterly pre opening costs  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs 
our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  we expect our highest earnings to occur in those periods 
as a result of all of these factors  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years we have funded our capital requirements primarily through cash flow from operations and proceeds from the initial public offering of our stock in august in  net cash flow provided by operating activities was million compared to million in and million in net cash flow provided by operating activities exceeded net income for primarily due to the effects of depreciation and amortization and the net changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities in was primarily due to an increase in our prepaid expenses and other assets resulting from prepaid rent and a decrease in accounts payable  offset by an increase in accrued liabilities 
in both and  net cash flow provided by operating activities exceeded net income due to the effects of depreciation and amortization and loss on impairment of property and equipment and restaurant closures 
we use cash to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and remodel our existing restaurants 
net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million in we opened three new restaurants in and purchased two previously franchised restaurants during the first quarter of compared to opening restaurants in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of million in compared to million in  which was the result of million spent on new restaurants compared to million in and million spent on capitalized maintenance and remodels compared to million in additionally  we invested million of our cash equivalents into short term marketable securities during to maximize interest income 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and consisted of employee common stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
additionally  in august  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire company common stock from time to time in open market purchases and through privately negotiated transactions 
under the program  up to million of company common stock may be reacquired 
as of january    shares were repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of million 
as of january  we have a million revolving line of credit  of which no balance is currently outstanding 
the line of credit expires on june  and bears interest at either the bank base rate minus or libor plus 
availability under the credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit  which totaled million as of january  in addition  the credit facility includes financial and non financial covenants  with which we were in full compliance as of january  and as of the date of this report 
our capital requirements  including costs related to opening additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
we anticipate total capital expenditures between million and million in  with the majority of expenditures associated with a minimum of and two new full service and asap restaurant openings  respectively 
other capital expenditures are expected to be higher than prior year trends and will be primarily directed toward maintenance capital associated with existing and mature stores  remodels and 
table of contents planned information technology upgrades 
we expect to fund all capital requirements using operating cash flow 
additionally  we anticipate pre opening costs per restaurant to range from approximately  to  pre opening costs now include rent expense incurred from the time the restaurant build out period is complete  and the restaurant is ready for its intended use  through the restaurant opening date 
this is an increase from previous estimates that totaled  any unexpected delays in construction  labor shortages or other factors could result in higher than anticipated pre opening costs 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our current cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from operations and funds anticipated to be available from our credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements on a short term and long term basis 
changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses or other events may cause us to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any unconsolidated vie transactions 
contractual commitments the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of january  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations represents aggregate minimum lease payments 
most of the leases also require contingent rent in addition to the minimum rent based on a percentage of sales and require expenses incidental to the use of the property 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost 
property and equipment is depreciated over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the related lease  whichever is shorter 
the lives for furniture  fixtures  and equipment are ten years 
the lives for buildings and leasehold improvements are the shorter of years or the term of the related operating lease 

table of contents long lived asset impairments we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including restaurant sites and other assets  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset group may not be recoverable 
the asset impairment review process assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows assets are expected to generate 
management has determined that restaurants with operating cash flows of less than a defined amount should be regularly monitored to determine if impairment charges should be taken 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset if any are less than the related asset s carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their fair values 
the net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset are determined by independent quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal specialists 
estimates of future cash flows and expected sales are judgments based on our experience and knowledge of local operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment  capital spending decisions and inflation 
for any properties that are planned to be closed and are under long term lease agreements  the present value of any remaining liability under the lease  discounted using risk free rates and net of expected sublease rental that could be reasonably obtained for the property is recognized as a liability and expensed when the criteria for sfas no 
have been met 
the value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect net recoverable values 
internal specialists estimate the subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on their historical experience and knowledge of the market in which the store to be closed is located  the results of our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and the current economic conditions 
specific real estate markets  the economic environment and inflation affect the actual cost of disposition for these leases and related assets 
during the year ended december   we determined that certain identified property and equipment was impaired and  as such  incurred impairment charges of million 
there was no remaining net book value associated with any of these properties at january  we did not incur any impairment charges for the year ended january  self insurance our business is primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile and general liability costs 
we record our self insurance liability  determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
any actuarial projection of ultimate losses is subject to a high degree of variability 
sources of this variability are numerous and include  but are not limited to  future economic conditions  court decisions and legislative actions 
our workers compensation future funding estimates anticipate no change in the benefit structure 
statutory changes could have a significant impact on future claim costs 
our workers compensation liabilities are from claims occurring in various states 
individual state workers compensation regulations have received a tremendous amount of attention from state politicians  insurers  employers and providers  as well as the public in general 
recent years have seen an escalation in the number of legislative reforms  judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting our business 
the changes in state political and economic environment increase the variability in unpaid claim liabilities 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 

table of contents for information regarding our provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  changes in the geographic composition of our income from operations  changes in our estimates of credits or deductions including those that may result from the american jobs creation act of  and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 
restaurant and franchise revenues revenues from the operation of company owned restaurants are recognized when sales occur 
all fees from franchised operations are included in revenue as earned 
royalty fees are based on franchised restaurants revenues and we record these fees in the period the related franchised restaurants revenues are earned 
pre opening costs we follow statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which was issued by the accounting standards executive committee and provides guidance on the financial reporting of start up costs and organization costs 
the sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
stock based compensation sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  encourages but does not require a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments 
sfas no 
allows an entity to elect to continue to measure compensation costs under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  but requires pro forma disclosure of net earnings as if the fair value based method of accounting had been applied 
we elected to follow apb no 
and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options for because the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb no 
 because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
this is a revision of sfas no 
and requires a fair value measurement of all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and recognition of those expenses in the statements of income 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and focuses on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
in addition  sfas no 
r will require the recognition of compensation expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award 
sfas no 
r is effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we plan to adopt this statement in the third quarter of  however  we have not determined the method of adoption under sfas no 
r and whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
new accounting standards the fasb recently issued several statements of financial accounting standards 
the statements relevant to our line of business and the impact on us are as follows in december  the fasb issued a revision of fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of the interpretation is to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with vies 
businesses that have a controlling financial interest in a vie should include in its consolidated financial statements the 
table of contents assets  liabilities and results of the activities of the vie 
we currently have no vies and therefore the adoption did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and focuses on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we plan to adopt this statement in the third quarter of in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets 
this statement eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   although earlier application is permitted 
we are still evaluating the components of this new standard and whether it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than three months as of the date of purchase 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in market prices related to our investments in marketable securities 
as of january  we had million in cash and marketable securities consisting of million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  we have a million line of credit agreement with bank of america  na that expires on june  interest on the line of credit is calculated on either the bank base rate minus or libor plus
