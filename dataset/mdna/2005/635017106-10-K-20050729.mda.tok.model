over the last several years  we have focused on increasing penetration of our brands in the convenience channel through company owned and independent distributors 
the convenience channel is composed of convenience stores  gas stations and other smaller up and down the street accounts 
because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail  we have undertaken specific measures to expand distribution in this channel

beverage industry sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer months 
additionally  our operating results are subject to numerous factors  including fluctuations in the costs of raw materials  changes in consumer preference for beverage products and competitive pricing in the marketplace 

table of contents results of operations net sales during fiscal  we initiated a series of price increases to offset unprecedented raw material cost increases  especially in the latter part of the year as sustained increases in fuel and resin continued to rise to historical new highs 
price increases tend to have an adverse effect on case volume and the industry generally experienced reduced case volume  especially for carbonated soft drinks 
as a result  our branded case volume was relatively flat for the year while net pricing was up slightly  due to higher selling prices and a change in product mix 
this product mix change included increased sales of our alternative beverages as obesity and other health issues caused consumers to consume less carbonated soft drinks 
also impacting sales was a nineteen percent volume decline in allied branded products related to a retailer s change in philosophy  which affected their sales and our earlier decision to eliminate certain lower margin business 
net sales included million received from a customer relative to the recovery of pricing and promotional allowances for product shipped in a previous year 
net sales for fiscal increased approximately million  or  to million 
this sales growth was due primarily to increased volume of national beverage s branded soft drinks and favorable changes in product mix 
this improvement was partially offset by a decline in lower margin allied branded business 
fiscal and fiscal consisted of weeks while fiscal consisted of weeks 
gross profit gross profit approximated of net sales for fiscal and for fiscal this decline was due to the effect of the sales decrease and higher cost of goods sold

gross profit  approximating of net sales for both fiscal and  increased million in fiscal an increase in higher margin business and a reduction in certain fixed manufacturing costs were partially offset by increases in certain raw material costs 
shipping and handling costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses  the classification of which is consistent with many beverage companies 
however  our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents liquidity we continually evaluate capital projects designed to expand capacity and improve efficiency at our manufacturing facilities 
in fiscal  we incurred increased capital expenditures to enhance packaging capabilities and improve manufacturing efficiencies 
such programs are expected to continue in fiscal  however  capital expenditures in fiscal should not exceed fiscal amounts 
in january  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  shares of national beverage common stock

contributions were million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal we maintain self insured and deductible programs for certain liability  medical and workers compensation exposures 
other long term liabilities include known claims and estimated incurred  but not reported  claims not otherwise covered by insurance  based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience 
since the timing and amount of claims settlement varies significantly  we are not able to reasonably estimate future payments for the periods indicated 
we have standby letters of credit aggregating million related to our self insurance programs  which expire in fiscal we expect to renew these standby letters of credit until they are no longer required 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  they may ultimately differ from actual results 
we believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs affect the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
credit risk we sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
exposure to losses on receivables varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer 
we monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances  credit conditions  and historical write offs and collections 
impairment of long lived assets all long lived assets  excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization  are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner in accordance with sfas no 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount  or for goodwill  the carrying amount of its reporting unit  is greater than its fair value 
income taxes our effective income tax rate and the tax bases of assets and liabilities are based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable 
deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
valuation allowances are established when it is deemed  more likely than not  that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
insurance programs we maintain self insured and deductible programs for certain liability  medical and workers compensation exposures 
accordingly  we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance  based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience 
sales incentives we offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers  which require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets 
in those circumstances when the incentive is paid in advance  we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume 
when the incentive is paid in arrears  we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume 
the recognition of expense for these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based 
table of contents on historical experience and other factors 
sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of revenues and actual amounts may vary from reported amounts

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodities we purchase various raw materials  including aluminum cans  plastic bottles  high fructose corn syrup  and various juice concentrates  the prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
interest rates we had no outstanding debt or debt related interest rate exposure during fiscal our investment portfolio is comprised of highly liquid securities consisting primarily of short term money market instruments and auction rate securities  the yields of which fluctuate based largely on short term treasury rates 
if the yield of these instruments had changed by basis points  interest income for fiscal would have changed by approximately
