risk factors the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
risks due to investment in real estate decreased revenues or increased operating expenses may cause decreased yields from an investment in real property 
real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
the yields available from investments in real estate depend upon the amount of revenues generated and expenses incurred 
if properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet operating expenses  including debt service and capital expenditures  our results from operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected 
the performance of the economy in each of the areas in which the properties are located affects occupancy  market rental rates and expenses 
these factors consequently can have an impact on revenues from the properties and their underlying values 
the financial results and labor decisions of major local employers may also have an impact on the revenues from and value of certain properties 
other factors may further adversely affect revenues from and values of our properties 
these factors include the general economic climate  local conditions in the areas in which properties are located such as an oversupply of apartment units or a reduction in the demand for apartment units  the attractiveness of the properties to residents  competition from other multifamily communities and our ability to provide adequate facilities maintenance  services and amenities 
our revenues would also be adversely affected if residents were unable to pay rent or we were unable to rent apartments on favorable terms 
if we were unable to promptly relet or renew the leases for a significant number of apartment units  or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting were significantly lower than expected rates  then our funds from operations would  and our ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt may  be adversely affected 
there is also a risk that as leases on the properties expire  residents will vacate or enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us 
operating costs  including real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  and mortgage payments  if any  do not  in general  decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a property 
we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the property  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet our mortgage payments 
in addition  applicable laws  including tax laws  interest rate levels and the availability of financing also affect revenues from properties and real estate values 
if we are unable to implement our growth strategy  or if we fail to identify  acquire or integrate new acquisitions  our results may suffer 
our future growth will be dependent upon a number of factors  including our ability to identify acceptable properties for development and acquisition  complete acquisitions and developments on favorable terms  successfully integrate acquired and newly developed properties  and obtain financing to support expansion 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategy  that growth will continue at historical levels or at all  or that any expansion will improve operating results 
the failure to identify  acquire and integrate new properties effectively could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
development and construction projects may not be completed or completed successfully 
as a general matter  property development and construction projects typically have a higher  and sometimes substantially higher  level of risk than the acquisition of existing properties 
we intend to actively pursue development and construction of multifamily apartment communities 
we cannot assure that we will complete development of the properties currently under development or any other development project that we may undertake 
risks associated with our development and construction activities may include the following development opportunities may be abandoned  construction costs of multifamily apartment communities may exceed original estimates  possibly making the communities uneconomical  occupancy rates and rents at newly completed communities may not be sufficient to make the communities profitable  financing for the construction and development of projects may not be available on favorable terms or at all  construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  and expenses of operating a completed community may be higher than anticipated 
in addition  development and construction activities  regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful  typically require a substantial portion of management s time and attention 
development and construction activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
investments in newly acquired properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
in the normal course of business  we typically evaluate potential acquisitions  enter into non binding letters of intent  and may  at any time  enter into contracts to acquire and may acquire additional properties 
however  we cannot assure that we will have the financial resources to make suitable acquisitions or those properties that satisfy our investment policies will be available for acquisition 
acquisitions of properties entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations 
estimates of the costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property might prove inaccurate 
other risks may include rehabilitation costs exceeding original estimates  possibly making a project uneconomical  financing not being available on favorable terms or at all  and rehabilitation and lease up not being completed on schedule 
in addition  there are general real estate investment risks associated with any new real estate investment  including environmental risks 
although we undertake an evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment before it is acquired  certain defects or necessary repairs may not be detected until after the investment is acquired 
this could significantly increase our total acquisition costs  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 
illiquidity of real estate and reinvestment risk may reduce economic returns to investors 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  tend to limit our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
additionally  the internal revenue code places certain limits on the number of properties a reit may sell without adverse tax consequences 
to effect our current operating strategy  we have in the past raised  and will seek to continue to raise additional funds  both through outside financing and through the orderly disposition of assets that no longer meet our investment criteria 
depending upon interest rates  current development and acquisition opportunities and other factors  generally we will reinvest the proceeds in additional multifamily properties  although such funds may be employed in other uses 
in the markets we have targeted for future acquisition of multifamily properties  there is considerable buying competition from other real estate companies  many of who may have greater resources  experience or expertise than we 
in many cases  this competition for acquisition properties has resulted in an increase in property prices and a decrease in property yields 
due to the relatively low capitalization rates currently prevailing in the pricing of potential acquisitions of multifamily properties which meet our investment criteria  we cannot assure that the proceeds realized from the disposition of assets  which no longer meet our investment criteria  can be reinvested to produce economic returns comparable to those being realized from the properties disposed of  or that we will be able to acquire properties meeting our investment criteria 
if we are unable to reinvest proceeds from the assets that no longer meet our investment criteria  or if properties acquired with such proceeds produce a lower rate of return than the properties disposed of  our results of operations may be materially affected 
in addition  a delay in reinvestment of such proceeds may have a material adverse effect on us 
we may seek to structure future dispositions as tax free exchanges  where appropriate  utilizing the non recognition provisions of section of the internal revenue code to defer income taxation on the disposition of the exchanged property 
for an exchange of these properties to qualify for tax free treatment under section of the internal revenue code  certain technical requirements must be met 
given the competition for properties meeting our investment criteria  it may be difficult for us to identify suitable properties within the applicable time frames in order to meet the requirements of section of the internal revenue code 
even if we can structure a suitable tax deferred exchange  as noted above  we cannot assure that we will reinvest the proceeds of any of these dispositions to produce economic returns comparable to those currently being realized from the properties which were disposed of 
substantial competition among multifamily properties and real estate companies may adversely affect our rental revenues and development and acquisition opportunities 
all of the properties currently owned by us are located in developed areas 
there are numerous other multifamily properties and real estate companies  many of which have greater financial and other resources than we have  within the market area of each of our properties which compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities 
the number of competitive multifamily properties and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on our ability to rent the apartments and the rents charged  and development and acquisition opportunities 
the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
our operations are concentrated in the western united states  we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate 
our portfolio is primarily located in the san francisco bay area  los angeles orange county  san diego  sacramento  seattle  the denver area and phoenix 
our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in  and other factors relating to  these geographic areas  including supply and demand for apartments in these areas  zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other properties and alternative forms of housing 
in that regard  certain of these areas have in the recent past or are currently experiencing economic recessions and depressed conditions in the local real estate or rental markets 
to the extent general economic or social conditions in any of these areas further deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters  the value of the portfolio  our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt could be materially adversely affected 
our insurance coverage is limited and may not cover all losses to our properties 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  mold  extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties with certain policy specifications  limits and deductibles 
while as of december   we carried flood and earthquake insurance for our properties with an aggregate annual limit of  subject to substantial deductibles  we cannot assure that this coverage will be available on acceptable terms or at an acceptable cost  or at all  in the future  or if obtained  that the limits of those policies will cover the full cost of repair or replacement of covered properties 
in addition  there may be certain extraordinary losses such as those resulting from civil unrest or terrorist acts that are not generally insured or fully insured against or underinsured losses such as those resulting from claims in connection with the occurrence of mold  asbestos  and lead because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured or underinsured loss occur to a property  we could be required to use our own funds for restoration or lose all or part of our investment in  and anticipated revenues from  the property and would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness on the property 
any such loss could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 
one property  red hawk ranch apartments  a unit operating community in fremont  california  requires extensive replacement work to correct damage we believe was caused by construction defects 
we estimate that the costs of remediation will approximate up to  we are currently pursuing litigation against the third party builder and various sub contractors 
however  we may be required to seek insurance coverage for some or all of the remediation costs 
if we are not able to recover these costs either through litigation or from our insurance coverage  it would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
adverse changes in laws may affect our potential liability relating to our properties and our operations 
increases in real estate taxes and income  service and transfer taxes cannot always be passed through to residents or users in the form of higher rents  and may adversely affect our cash available for distribution and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
similarly  changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions  as well as changes in laws affecting development  construction and safety requirements  may result in significant unanticipated expenditures  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 
in addition  future enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs 
compliance with laws benefiting disabled persons may require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures or impact our investment strategy 
a number of federal  state and local laws including the americans with disabilities act and regulations exist that may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features which add to the cost of buildings under construction 
legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons 
the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial  and limits or restrictions on construction or completion of certain renovations may limit implementation of our investment strategy in certain instances or reduce overall returns on our investments  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
we review our properties periodically to determine the level of compliance and  if necessary  take appropriate action to bring such properties into compliance 
we believe  based on property reviews to date  that the costs of such compliance should not have a material adverse effect on us 
these conclusions are based upon currently available information and data  and we cannot assure that further review and analysis of our properties  or future legal interpretations or legislative changes  will not significantly increase the costs of compliance 
the operations of bre property investors llc are limited 
thirteen of our properties are held by bre property investors llc  which is referred to in this annual report on form k as the operating company 
we are the sole managing member of the operating company and  as of december   held approximately a equity interest in it 
third parties as non managing members hold the remaining equity interests in the operating company 
under the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing the operations of the operating company  the operating company is required to maintain certain debt service coverage  debt to asset and other financial ratios intended to protect the members rights to receive distributions 
in addition  with respect to the outstanding debt for certain properties  the operating company is restricted from repaying its debt or taking certain other specified actions that could have adverse tax consequences for the members 
further  we  as the managing member  are restricted from taking certain other specified actions either absolutely or without the consent of a majority in interest of the non managing members or of the non managing members affected thereby including  but not limited to  any actions that would make it impossible to carry out the business of the operating company  that would subject a non managing member to liability as a managing member  or that would cause the operating company to institute bankruptcy proceedings or permit an automatic judgment to be entered against it by a creditor 
the requirement to maintain financial ratios and the restrictions on the actions of the operating company and us as managing member could have a material adverse affect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
further  under the terms of the operating company s limited liability company agreement  the operating company must obtain the consent of a majority in interest of the non managing members in order to dispose of any of the properties held by the operating company of which there are properties with a gross cost of  in a taxable sale or exchange prior to respective dates which are specified in the operating company s limited liability company agreement for each of the properties  ranging from eight to years from november   or dissolve the operating company other than in certain limited circumstances specified in the operating company s limited liability company agreement  such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets  or any merger  consolidation or other combination by us with or into another person  or reclassification  recapitalization or change of our outstanding equity interests 
these restrictions on our ability to dispose of a portion of our properties and to dissolve the operating company  even when such a disposition or dissolution of the operating company would be in our best interest  could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
the operating company also must distribute all available cash as defined in the operating company s limited liability company agreement on a quarterly basis as follows first  a priority distribution to members other than us until each member has received  cumulatively on a per operating company unit basis  distributions equal to the cumulative dividends declared with respect to one share of bre common stock over the corresponding period subject to adjustment from time to time as applicable to account for stock dividends  stock splits and similar transactions affecting bre common stock  and second  the balance to us 
if the operating company s available cash in any quarterly period is insufficient to permit distribution of the full amount of the priority distribution described above for that quarter  we are required to make a capital contribution to the operating company in an amount equal to the lesser of the amount necessary to permit the full priority distribution  or an amount equal to the sum of any capital expenditures made by the operating company plus the sum of any payments made by the operating company on account of any loans to or investments in  or any guarantees of the obligations of  bre or our affiliates for that quarterly period 
we may not voluntarily withdraw from the operating company or transfer all or any portion of our interest in the operating company without the consent of all of the non managing members  except in certain limited circumstances  such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets  or any merger  consolidation or other combination by us with or into another person  or any reclassification  recapitalization or change of our outstanding equity interests 
such restrictions on our withdrawal as the managing member of the operating company  and on our ability to transfer our interest in the operating company  could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
survey exceptions to certain title insurance policies may result in incomplete coverage in the event of a claim 
we have not obtained updated surveys for all of the properties we have acquired or developed 
because updated surveys were not always obtained  the title insurance policies obtained by us may contain exceptions for matters that an updated survey might have disclosed 
such matters might include such things as boundary encroachments  unrecorded easements or similar matters  which would have been reflected on a survey 
moreover  because no updated surveys were prepared for some properties  we cannot assure that the title insurance policies in fact cover the entirety of the real property  buildings  fixtures  and improvements which we believe they cover  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
risks due to real estate financing we anticipate that future developments and acquisitions will be financed  in whole or in part  under various construction loans  lines of credit  and other forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of additional debt or equity by us 
we expect periodically to review our financing options regarding the appropriate mix of debt and equity financing 
equity  rather than debt  financing of future developments or acquisitions could have a dilutive effect on the interests of our existing shareholders 
similarly  there are certain risks involved with financing future developments and acquisitions with debt  including those described below 
in addition  if new developments are financed through construction loans  there is a risk that  upon completion of construction  permanent financing for such properties may not be available or may be available only on disadvantageous terms or that the cash flow from new properties will be insufficient to cover debt service 
if a newly developed or acquired property is unsuccessful  our losses may exceed our investment in the property 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
we may be unable to renew  repay or refinance our outstanding debt 
we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing  including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  the risk that indebtedness on our properties  or unsecured indebtedness  will not be able to be renewed  repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness 
if we were unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms  or at all  we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms  which might result in losses to us 
such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 
furthermore  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property  appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies  all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value 
foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds  thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the internal revenue code 
rising interest rates would increase the cost of our variable rate debt 
we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness and interest rate hedges that bear interest at variable rates 
accordingly  increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of our common shares to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us  which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
we may incur additional debt in the future 
we currently fund the acquisition and development of multifamily communities partially through borrowings including our lines of credit as well as from other sources such as sales of properties which no longer meet our investment criteria or the contribution of property to joint ventures which may in turn secure debt 
our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur 
accordingly  subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements  we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt and in an increased risk of default on our obligations 
the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately billion 
our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to minimum net worth  interest coverage ratios  maximum secured debt  and total debt to capital  among others 
in the event that an event of default occurs  our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations 
we sometimes seek to take advantage of interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements  such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements  with the objective of lowering our overall borrowing costs 
these agreements involve risks  such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements  that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our borrowing costs  and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable 
hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments 
failure to hedge effectively may materially adversely affect our results of operations 
potential liability under environmental laws under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in  on  around or under such property 
such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of  or failure to remediate properly  hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect the owner s or operator s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person 
certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials into the air  and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances 
federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks 
in connection with the current or former ownership direct or indirect  operation  management  development and or control of real properties  we may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and  therefore  may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as certain other costs  including governmental fines  and claims for injuries to persons and property 
our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each property we seek to acquire and to proceed accordingly 
we cannot assure  however  that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future properties will reveal all or the full extent of potential environmental liabilities  that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition unknown to us  that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of such properties  or that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period 
a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability 
thus  we may have liability with respect to properties previously sold by our predecessors or us 
recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate 
some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements 
insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately 
we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers mold related claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold 
to the extent not covered by our pollution policy  the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage  health concerns  or allegations thereof  arise 
risks associated with our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 
the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors  misstatements or misrepresentations 
as part of management s on going review of our accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting  on january   management determined that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to recognition of certain costs and expenses as incurred rather than as paid 
this weakness resulted in certain expenses being recorded out of period and led to the restatement in this annual report on form k of our results for the years ended december    and  and the interim periods presented herein 
in connection with correcting this error  management has taken appropriate action to modify our system of internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weakness 
while management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  we can not assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time 
other deficiencies  particularly a material weakness  in internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations  restatements of our financial statements  a decline in our stock price  or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  reputation  results of operation  financial condition or liquidity 
ranking of securities and subordination of claims a portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries  including the operating company 
our cash flow and the consequent ability to make distributions and other payments on our equity securities and to service our debt will be partially dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us  or upon loans or other payments of funds made by our subsidiaries to us 
in addition  debt or other arrangements of our subsidiaries may impose restrictions that affect  among other things  our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make other distributions or loans to us 
likewise  a portion of our consolidated assets is owned by our subsidiaries  effectively subordinating certain of our unsecured indebtedness to all existing and future liabilities  including indebtedness  trade payables  lease obligations and guarantees of our subsidiaries 
the operating company has guaranteed amounts due under our  bank credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
likewise  any other of our subsidiaries with assets or net income which  when multiplied by our effective percentage ownership interest in such subsidiary exceeds  or of our consolidated net income  respectively  is required to guarantee the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility 
the operating company and other of our subsidiaries may also  from time to time  guarantee other of our indebtedness 
therefore  our rights and rights of our creditors  including the holders of other unsecured indebtedness  to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary s creditors  except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary  in which case our claims would still be effectively subordinate to any security interests in or mortgages or other liens on the assets of such subsidiary and would be subordinate to any indebtedness of such subsidiary senior to that held by us 
provisions in our charter and bylaws that could limit a change in control or deter a takeover in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  not more than in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities 
in order to protect us against risk of losing our status as a reit due to a concentration of ownership among our shareholders  our charter provides that any shareholder must  upon demand  disclose to our board of directors in writing such information with respect to such shareholder s direct and indirect ownership of the shares of our stock as we deem necessary to permit us to comply or to verify compliance with the reit provisions of the internal revenue code  or the requirements of any other taxing authority 
our charter further provides  among other things  that if our board of directors determines  in good faith  that direct or indirect ownership of bre stock has or may become concentrated to an extent that would prevent us from qualifying as a reit  our board of directors may prevent the transfer of bre stock or call for redemption by lot or other means affecting one or more shareholders selected in the sole discretion of our board of directors of a number of shares of bre stock sufficient in the opinion of our board of directors to maintain or bring the direct or indirect ownership of bre stock into conformity with the requirements for maintaining reit status 
these limitations may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without consent of our board of directors 
in addition  certain other provisions contained in our charter and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may thereby inhibit a change in control 
our charter includes provisions granting our board of directors the authority to issue preferred stock from time to time and to establish the terms  preferences and rights of such preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders  restrictions on our shareholders ability to remove directors and fill vacancies on our board of directors  restrictions on unsolicited business combinations and restrictions on our shareholders ability to amend our charter 
our bylaws contain restrictions on our shareholders ability to call special meetings of our board of directors and to take action without a meeting  provisions granting our board of directors the power to amend our bylaws  provisions allowing our board of directors to increase its size  and restrictions on the transfer of shares of our capital stock with respect to the preservation of our reit status 
such provisions may deter tender offers for bre stock  which offers may be attractive to our shareholders  or deter purchases of large blocks of bre stock  thereby limiting the opportunity for shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of bre stock over then prevailing market prices 
tax risks we may be subject to tax liabilities if we fail to qualify as a reit 
although management believes that we are organized and are operating so as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  we cannot assure that we have in fact operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain so qualified 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
for example  in order to qualify as a reit  at least of our taxable gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources  and we must make distributions to shareholders aggregating annually at least of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains 
thus  to the extent revenues from non qualifying sources such as income from third party management represents more than of our gross income in any taxable year  we will not satisfy the income test and may fail to qualify as a reit  unless certain relief provisions apply 
even if those relief provisions apply  a tax would be imposed with respect to our excess non qualifying income  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
additionally  in order to qualify as a reit  we must meet certain tests with respect to the nature of our assets 
if we fail to meet any of the asset tests and do not cure such failure within the applicable period  unless certain relief provisions apply  we would not qualify as a reit  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at corporate rates  which would likely have a material adverse effect on us  our share price and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
in addition  unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
this treatment would reduce funds available for investment or distribution to our shareholders because of the additional tax liability to us for the year or years involved 
in addition  we would no longer be required to make distributions to our shareholders 
to the extent that distributions to our shareholders would have been made in anticipation of qualifying as a reit  we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate certain investments to pay the applicable tax 
finally  we cannot assure that new legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification

this is more reflective of the operating performance of the real estate  and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets 
in addition  because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures  with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate  noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets 
however  because noi excludes depreciation and does not capture the change in the value of our communities resulting from operational use and market conditions  nor the level of capital expenditures required to adequately maintain the communities all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations  the utility of noi as a measure of our performance is limited 
other equity reits may not calculate noi consistently with our definition and  accordingly  our noi may not be comparable to such other reits noi 
accordingly  noi should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance 
noi should not be used as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
noi also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap

item legal proceedings on april   we purchased red hawk ranch apartments  a unit operating community in fremont  california  from an unrelated third party builder 
the community now requires extensive replacement work to correct damage we believe was caused by construction defects 
on march   we filed suit in the alameda county superior court against the builder and other parties to protect against statutes of limitation 
we have conducted testing to determine the extent of the damage 
based upon the testing that has been performed to date  we have discovered that the exterior shell of each building at the community has been compromised 
as a result  during second quarter we expanded the size and scope of the lawsuit 
we plan to commence reconstruction during the first six months of and expect to have the community restored during the next to months 
we are actively pursuing the litigation against the third party builder and various sub contractors 
while management expects that costs of remediation will approximate up to  and future plaintiff litigation costs may exceed million  due to the preliminary nature of the damage assessment  claims and litigation  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of legal actions  nor is it reasonably possible to accurately estimate the full range of costs associated with the matter at this time 
in addition to the legal proceeding described above  we are defending various claims and legal actions that arise in our normal course of business 
while it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters  in the opinion of management  none of these actions will have a material adverse effect on us

ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income or loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition 
we believe that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  as reflected through depreciation 
because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental performance measure because it excludes historical cost depreciation  as well as gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated property  from gaap net income 
by excluding depreciation and gains or losses on sales of real estate  management uses ffo to measure returns on its investments in real estate assets 
however  because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of our properties  all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations  the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 
management also believes that ffo  combined with the required gaap presentations  is useful to investors in providing more meaningful comparisons of the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and is not intended to indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of a reit s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
our ffo may not be comparable to the ffo of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the nareit definition

executive summary we are a self administered equity real estate investment trust or reit focused on the development  acquisition and management of multifamily apartment communities in seven metropolitan markets of the western united states 
at december   our portfolio had real estate assets with a net book value of approximately billion that included wholly or majority owned completed apartment communities  aggregating  units  two multifamily communities owned in joint ventures  comprised of apartment units  and eight apartment communities in various stages of construction and development  totaling  units 
we earn revenue and generate cash primarily by collecting monthly rent from our apartment residents 
our and operating results reflect deteriorating national and regional economic conditions and the corresponding impact on our market level rents and occupancy  with modest recovery reflected in operating metrics toward the end of  including market rents  occupancy and turnover  reflected national and regional economic cycles at peak levels  just prior to entering a recessionary phase 
recessionary pressures and weakening employment conditions that accelerated during continued throughout and  resulting in depressed market rents  flat average occupancy levels and higher than normal resident turnover levels 
in  the economic factors stabilized in most of our markets  resulting in flat to modest improvement in operating metrics 
we have experienced sustained growth in our southern california markets  which comprised of our real estate net operating income in market rents in southern california have increased over the past three years and occupancy and turnover have remained stable 
management has focused its efforts on growth in the southern california markets due to these market dynamics  and has acquired  units  completed the development of units and commenced construction on another  units in the region during the last two years 
economic conditions and continued job losses had the greatest impact in our san francisco bay area market 
during  market level rents in our san francisco bay area communities continued to decline from peak levels 
market rent in our bay area portfolio peaked in the third quarter of at approximately  per unit and has declined sequentially each of the past four years  to an average of  per unit in management does not expect market rents to recover in this region until there is discernable job growth 
we continue to closely monitor and act upon the key operating metrics market rent  occupancy  and turnover in each of our markets 
our wholly or majority owned apartment communities can be categorized as follows to better understand our overall results  units in communities were completed and stabilized for all of and same store communities   units in nine communities were acquired in or and as a result did not have comparable year over year operating results   units in four development communities were completed and stabilized during and and as a result did not have comparable year over year operating results  units in three communities are classified as held for sale at december   and units in one community require significant reconstruction 
in addition to year over year economic operating performance  our results of operations for the three years ended december  were affected by income derived from acquisitions and completions of apartment communities  offset by the cost of capital associated with financing these transactions 
our book capitalization grew to billion at december   from billion at december   reflecting capital raised through offerings of debt  perpetual preferred stock and common stock

net income available to common shareholders as a result of the various factors mentioned above  net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share  as compared with  or per diluted share for the year ended december  and  or per diluted share for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources depending upon the availability and cost of external capital  we anticipate making additional investments in multifamily apartment communities 
these investments are expected to be funded through a variety of sources 
these sources may include internally generated cash  temporary borrowings under our revolving unsecured line of credit  proceeds from asset sales  public and private offerings of debt and equity securities  and in some cases the assumption of secured borrowings 
to the extent that these additional investments are initially financed with temporary borrowings under our revolving unsecured line of credit  we anticipate that permanent financing will be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities  proceeds from asset sales and secured debt 
we believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations  meet debt service and dividend requirements  and finance future investments

restatement of real estate expense  general and administrative expense and construction in progress this annual report on form k restates previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  through december   and the quarterly periods ended march   june  and september   to properly reflect accruals of payroll and certain other real estate costs and expenses at the end of each reporting period 
during management s review of our accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting  management determined that we should have recognized these costs as incurred rather than as paid 
our management determined that the internal control deficiency that resulted in this restatement represents a material weakness  as defined by the public company accounting oversight board s auditing standard no 
in connection with correcting this error  management has taken appropriate action to modify our system of internal control over financial reporting to remediate this internal control deficiency 
going forward  management will estimate and record accruals for payroll and the other real estate expenses that were not previously accounted for in this manner  as well as for development and construction costs for services performed but not yet billed  at the end of each reporting period 
a description of this control deficiency and the related remediation measures that have been undertaken by us is set forth in part ii  item a  controls and procedures of this form k 
investments in rental properties rental properties are recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation  less an adjustment  if any  for impairment 
a land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately  or based on market research if acquired in a merger or in an operating community acquisition 
we have a development group which manages the design  development and construction of our apartment communities 
projects under development are carried at cost  including direct and indirect costs incurred to ready the assets for their intended use and which are specifically identifiable  including capitalized interest and property taxes until units are placed in service 
direct investment development projects are considered placed in service as certificates of occupancy are issued and the units become ready for occupancy 
depreciation begins as units are placed in service 
land acquired for development is capitalized and reported as land under development until the development plan for the land is formalized 
once the development plan is determined and construction contracts are signed  the costs are transferred to the balance sheet line item construction in progress 
costs of replacements  such as appliances  carpets and drapes  are expensed 
improvements and betterments that increase the value of the property or extend its useful life are capitalized 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which generally range from to years for buildings and three to ten years for other property 
the determination as to whether expenditures should be capitalized or expensed  and the period over which depreciation is recognized  requires management s judgment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our investments in real estate are periodically evaluated for indicators of impairment 
the evaluation of impairment and the determination of values are based on several factors  and future events could occur which would cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and a reduction in carrying value to estimated fair value is warranted 
there were no assets for which an adjustment for impairment in value was made in  or in the normal course of business  we will receive offers for sale of our properties  either solicited or unsolicited 
for those offers that are accepted  the prospective buyer will usually require a due diligence period before consummation of the transaction 
it is not unusual for matters to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process 
we classify real estate as held for sale when all criteria under sfas no 
have been met 
sfas no 
also requires that the assets and liabilities and the results of operations of any communities that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in all periods presented 
the community specific real estate classified as held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal costs 
depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale 
derivatives and hedging activities we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business with the objective of lowering our overall borrowing costs 
as of december   we had four interest rate swap agreements with a notional value aggregating approximately  which are used to attain a floating rate of interest on a portion of our fixed rate debt  maturing in these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
a third party values the instruments 
the values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
we have adopted the prospective method as provided for in sfas  under which the provisions of sfas are applied prospectively to all awards granted  modified or settled after january  prior to  we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  which resulted in no expense recognition 
under sfas  we include in general and administrative expense a charge based on the implied value of options vesting in the current period 
the change in accounting method did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the options are valued using the black scholes option pricing model 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we expect to adopt sfas r on july  and do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
in december  the fasb modified fin to make technical corrections and address implementation issues that had arisen 
fin provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities vies and determining when a company should include the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements 
fin applies immediately to arrangements created after january  and  with respect to arrangements created before february   the interpretation was applied to bre as of january  under fin  a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk in the entity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or ii the entity s equity holders as a group either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity  b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur  or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
if an entity is deemed to be a vie pursuant to fin  the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of the expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
expected losses and residual returns for vies are calculated based on the probability of estimated future cash flows as defined in fin the adoption of fin did not have any effect on bre s financial position or results of operations 
based on the provisions of fin  we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we i enter into option agreements for the purchase of land from an entity and pay a non refundable deposit or ii enter into an arrangement with a financial partner for the formation of joint ventures which engage in multifamily real estate projects  a vie may be created under condition ii in the previous paragraph 
for each vie created  we compute expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows 
if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  the assets  liabilities and operations of the vie will be consolidated with our financial statements 
we consolidate entities not deemed as vies which we have the ability to control 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of bre and controlled subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
impact of inflation approximately of our total revenues for were derived from apartment properties 
due to the short term nature of most apartment unit leases typically one year or less  we may seek to adjust rents to mitigate the impact of inflation upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases  although we cannot assure that we will be able to adjust rents in response to inflation 
in addition  market rates may also fluctuate due to short term leases and other permitted and non permitted lease terminations 
dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders and distributions to minority members a cash dividend has been paid to common shareholders each quarter since our inception in the payment of distributions by bre is at the discretion of the board of directors and depends on numerous factors  including our cash flow  financial condition and capital requirements  reit provisions of the internal revenue code and other factors 
cash dividends per common share were in   and total cash dividends paid to common shareholders for the three years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
in  and  respectively    and  in dividends were paid to preferred shareholders 
distributions to minority members and operating company unit holders were  in   in  and  in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
we do not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our lines of credit 
we primarily enter into fixed and variable rate debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and development  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we continuously evaluate our level of variable rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including our assessment of the current and future economic environment 
we utilize four interest rate swap agreements to attain a floating rate of interest on a portion of our fixed rate debt 
the objective of the agreements is to lower our overall borrowing costs 
the swaps hedge the fair market value of a portion of our debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the hedges are perfectly effective and  therefore  changes in the derivative fair value and the change in fair value of the hedged items during the hedging period exactly offset with no valuation impact on our current earnings 
the notional amount of the interest rate swaps and their termination dates  shown in the table below  match the principal amounts and maturities of the hedged fixed rate debt balances 
as a result of the interest rate swaps  the effective interest rate for the twelve months ended december  on the aggregate hedged debt was reduced from a weighted average stated rate of to 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps was approximately  at december  table of interest rate swaps maturity notional amount in thousands fixed interest rate on debt fixed rate received on swap variable rate paid on swap effective interest rate on debt february july july october the fair values of our financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash  other assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses  and lines of credit approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature  terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates 
the fair value of mortgage loans payable and unsecured senior notes is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses with an interest rate similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements 
the estimated fair value of our mortgage loans and unsecured senior notes is approximately  at december   as compared with a carrying value of  at that date 
we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates would have had an annualized unfavorable impact of approximately  on our earnings and cash flows based on these period end debt levels and our average variable interest rates for each of the twelve months ended december  and we cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt and  therefore  our exposure to neither market risk  nor can we assure that fixed rate  long term debt will be available to us at advantageous pricing 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
