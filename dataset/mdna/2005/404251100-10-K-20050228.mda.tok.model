the company s patents covering its hearth and home products  protect various technical innovations and expire at various times  depending upon each patent s date of filing 
while the acquisition of patents reflects hearth home technologies inc s position in the market as an innovation leader  the company believes that neither any individual hearth and home product s patent nor the company s hearth and home patents in the aggregate are material to the company s business as a whole 
the company applies for patent protection when it believes the expense of doing so is justified  and the company believes that the duration of its registered patents is adequate to protect these rights 
the company also pays royalties in certain instances for the use of patents on products and processes owned by others 
the company actively protects its trademarks that it believes have significant value 
sales and distribution customers in  the company s ten largest customers represented approximately of its consolidated net sales 
the substantial purchasing power exercised by large customers may adversely affect the prices at which the company can successfully offer its products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its customer relationships as consolidation of its customers occur 
the company today sells its products through five principal distribution channels 
the first channel  independent  local office furniture and office products dealers  specialize in the sale of a broad range of office furniture and office furniture systems  mostly to small and medium sized businesses  branch offices of large corporations  and home office owners 
a portion of these dealers specialize in selling to federal  state and local government offices and school districts 
the second distribution channel comprises national office product distributors including office max incorporated  corporate express inc  a buhrmann company  office depot  and staples 
these distributors sell furniture along with office supplies through a national network of dealerships and sales offices which assist their customers with the evaluation of office space requirements  systems layout and product selection  and design and office solution services provided by professional designers 
all except corporate express inc also sell through retail office products superstores 
the third distribution channel  corporate accounts  is where the company has the direct selling relationship with the end user 
installation is normally provided through a dealer 
the fourth distribution channel  wholesalers  serve as distributors of the company s products to independent dealers  national supply dealers and superstores 
the company sells to the nation s largest wholesalers  united stationers and sp richards  as well as to regional wholesalers 
wholesalers maintain inventory of standard product lines for resale to the various retailers 
they also special order products from the company in customer selected models and colors 
the company s wholesalers maintain warehouse locations throughout the united states  which enable the company to make its products available for rapid delivery to retailers anywhere in the country 
one customer  united stationers  accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated net sales in and  and in the fifth distribution channel consists of direct sales of the company s products to federal  state and local government offices

sales managers and salespersons are compensated by a combination of salary and incentive bonus 
office products dealers  national wholesalers and retailers market their products over the internet and through catalogs published periodically 
these catalogs are distributed to existing and potential customers 
the company believes that the inclusion of the company s product lines in customer catalogs and e business offers strong potential for increased sales of the listed product items due to the exposure provided 
the company also makes export sales through hni international to office furniture dealers and wholesale distributors serving select foreign markets 
distributors are principally located in latin america and the caribbean 
sales outside of the united states and canada represented approximately of net sales in fiscal limited quantities of select finished goods inventories built to order awaiting shipment are at the company s principal manufacturing plants and at its various distribution centers

the company has a field sales organization of regional sales managers  salespersons  and firms of independent manufacturers representatives 
as of january   the company had an order backlog of approximately million which will be filled in the ordinary course of business within the first few weeks of the current fiscal year 
this compares with million as of january   and million as of december  backlog  in terms of percentage of net sales  was   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the company s products are typically manufactured and shipped within a few weeks following receipt of order 
the dollar amount of the company s order backlog is therefore not considered by management to be a leading indicator of the company s expected sales in any particular fiscal period 
for a discussion of the seasonal nature of the company s sales  see operating segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition the office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a significant number of competitors offering similar products 
the company competes by emphasizing its ability to deliver compelling value products and unsurpassed customer service 
in executing this strategy  the company has two significant classes of competitors 
first  the company competes with numerous small and medium sized office furniture manufacturers that focus on more limited product lines and or end user segments and include global furniture inc a canadian company  kimball office furniture co  chromcraft  and teknion a canadian company  as well as global imports 
second  the company competes with the large office furniture manufacturers which control a substantial portion of the market share in the project oriented office furniture market  such as steelcase inc  haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  and knoll  inc 
products and brands offered by these project oriented office furniture market participants have strong acceptance in the market place and have developed  and may continue to develop product designs to compete with the company 
the company also faces significant price competition from its competitors and may encounter competition from new market entrants 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in its markets in the future 
hearth products  consisting of prefabricated fireplaces and related products  are manufactured by a number of national and regional competitors 
the company competes primarily against other large manufacturers  including cfm majestic inc a canadian company and lennox industries inc 
both office furniture and hearth products compete on the basis of performance  quality  price  complete and on time delivery to the customer  and customer service and support 
the company believes that it competes principally by providing compelling value products designed to be among the best in their price range for product quality and performance  superior customer service  and short lead times 
this is made possible  in part  by the company s significant on going investment in product development  highly efficient and low cost manufacturing operations  and an extensive distribution network 
the company is one of the largest office furniture manufacturers in the united states  and believes that it is the largest provider of furniture to small and medium sized workplaces 
the company is also the largest manufacturer and marketer of fireplaces in the united states 
for further discussion of the company s competitive situation  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
effects of inflation certain business costs may  from time to time  increase at a rate exceeding the general rate of inflation 
during  the company experienced an increase in steel prices in excess of percent driven by global supply and demand 
the company s objective is to offset the effect of inflation on its costs primarily through productivity increases in combination with certain adjustments to the selling price of its products as competitive market and general economic conditions permit 
investments are routinely made in modernizing plants  equipment  support systems  and for rci programs 
these investments collectively focus on business simplification and increasing productivity which helps to offset the effect of rising material and labor costs 
ongoing cost control disciplines are also routinely employed 
in addition  the last in  first out lifo valuation method is used for most of the company s inventories  which ensures the changing material and labor costs are recognized in reported income  and more importantly  these costs are recognized in pricing decisions 
environmental the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges of air and water  the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials  and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances 
although the company believes it is in material compliance with all of the various regulations applicable to its business  there can be no assurance that requirements will not change in the future or that the company will not incur material costs to comply with such regulations 
the company has trained staff responsible for monitoring compliance with environmental  health  and safety requirements 
the company s environmental professionals work with responsible personnel at each manufacturing facility  the company s environmental legal counsel  and consultants on the management of environmental  health and safety issues 
the company s ultimate goal is to reduce and  when practical  eliminate the generation of environmental pollutants in its manufacturing processes 
compliance with federal  state  and local environmental regulations has not had a material effect on the capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position of the company to date 
the company does not anticipate that financially material capital expenditures will be required during fiscal year for environmental control facilities 
it is management s judgment that compliance with current regulations should not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  the uncertainty of new environmental legislation and technology in this area makes it impossible to know with confidence

item legal proceedings the company is involved in various kinds of disputes and legal proceedings that have arisen in the course of its business  including pending litigation  preferential payment claims in customer bankruptcies  environmental remediation  taxes  and other claims 
the company currently has a claim for approximately million pending against it arising out of the bankruptcy of a customer filed in the company was named a critical vendor by the bankruptcy court and  accordingly  was paid in full for all outstanding receivables 
the claim alleges that the company received preferential payments from the customer during the ninety days before the customer filed for bankruptcy protection 
the claim was brought in february the company has recorded an accrual with respect to this contingency  in an amount substantially less than the full amount of the claim  which represents the best estimate within the range of likely exposure and intends to vigorously defend against the claim 
given the nature of this claim  it is possible that the ultimate outcome could differ from the recorded amount 
it is our opinion  after consultation with legal counsel  that additional liabilities  if any  resulting from these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  although such matters could have a material effect on our quarterly or annual operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future period

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s historical results of operations and of its liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and related notes 
overview the company has two reportable core operating segments office furniture and hearth products 
the company is the second largest office furniture manufacturer in the united states and the nation s leading manufacturer and marketer of gas and wood burning fireplaces 
the company changed its name  with the approval of its shareholders  from hon industries inc to hni corporation effective may  the company believes that changing its name will allow it to accomplish three important goals as it moves forward with its strategy of managing multiple distinct and independent brands create a corporate identity that clearly represents who it is today the parent company for many of the leading brand name companies in the office furniture and hearth markets  establish a corporate brand that better reflects the company s strategic growth program product line extensions  market expansion  and strategic acquisitions  and eliminate the confusion in the marketplace  resulting from the use of hon in both the corporate name and in the name of its largest operating company  and clarify the ownership of our other operating companies and their relationship with the hon company

the housing market remained strong during  which positively impacted the company s hearth segment 
the company gained market share by providing strong brands  innovative products and services and greater value to its end users

the company generated million in cash flow from operating activities during  compared to million in the company paid dividends of million and repurchased million of its common stock  while investing million in strategic acquisitions and million in net capital expenditures and repaying million of debt in critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year end the company follows a week fiscal year which ends on the saturday nearest december fiscal year ended on january   ended on january   and ended on december  the financial statements for fiscal year are based on a week period and fiscal years and are on a week basis 
a week year occurs approximately every sixth year 
revenue recognition revenue is normally recognized upon shipment of goods to customers 
in certain circumstances revenue is not recognized until the goods are received by the customer or upon installation and customer acceptance based on the terms of the sale agreement 
revenue includes freight charged to customers  related costs are included in selling and administrative expense 
rebates  discounts  and other marketing program expenses directly related to the sale are recorded as a reduction to net sales 
marketing program accruals require the use of management estimates and the consideration of contractual arrangements subject to interpretation 
customer sales that reach certain award levels can affect the amount of such estimates  and actual results could differ from these estimates 
future market conditions may require increased incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction in net sales at the time the incentive is offered 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on several factors including overall customer credit quality  historical write off experience and specific account analysis that project the ultimate collectibility of the account 
as such  these factors may change over time causing the reserve level to adjust accordingly 
when it is determined that a customer is unlikely to pay  a charge is recorded to bad debt expense in the income statement and the allowance for doubtful accounts is increased 
when it becomes certain the customer cannot pay  the receivable is written off by removing the accounts receivable amount and reducing the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
as of january   there was approximately million in outstanding accounts receivable and million recorded in the allowance for doubtful accounts to cover potential future customer non payments 
however  if economic conditions deteriorate significantly or one of our large customers were to declare bankruptcy  a larger allowance for doubtful accounts might be necessary 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million at year end and  respectively 
inventory valuation the company values of its inventory by the last in  first out lifo method 
additionally  the company evaluates inventory reserves in terms of excess and obsolete exposure 
this evaluation includes such factors as anticipated usage  inventory turnover  inventory levels and ultimate product sales value 
as such  these factors may change over time causing the reserve level to adjust accordingly 
the reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were million  million  and million at year end   and  respectively 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the amount of the asset reflected in the company s balance sheet may not be recoverable 
an estimate of undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset  or the appropriate group of assets  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about future operating performance 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
asset impairment charges associated with the company s restructuring activities are discussed in the restructuring related charges note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the company s continuous focus on improving the manufacturing process tends to increase the likelihood of assets being replaced  therefore  the company is constantly evaluating the expected useful lives of its equipment which can result in accelerated depreciation 
additionally  the company recorded losses on the disposal of assets in the amount of million and million in and  respectively  as a result of its rapid continuous improvement initiatives 
goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis based on values at the end of third quarter or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the company has evaluated its goodwill for impairment and has determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value  so no impairment of goodwill was recognized 
goodwill of approximately million is shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of fiscal management s assumptions about future cash flows for the reporting units require significant judgment and actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those forecasted today 
we believe our assumptions used in discounting future cash flows would have no impact on the reported carrying amount of goodwill 
the estimated future cash flow for any reporting unit could be reduced by without decreasing the fair value to less than the carrying value 
the company also determines the fair value of indefinite lived trademarks on an annual basis or whenever indication of impairment exist
