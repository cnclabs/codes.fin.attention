item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto of the company included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks relating to our business in this section 
overview we were founded in and opened our first store in carlsbad  california 
in september  two funds managed by apax partners  lp  a private equity firm  together with bernard zeichner  acquired the business 
mr 
zeichner undertook several strategic initiatives for a national new store expansion program  including hiring a number of other senior executives with national retail experience  and upgrading our information systems  distribution systems and facilities 
in september  we launched our second distinct retail concept by acquiring stores and a license to use the rampage name on retail stores 
in august  we further enhanced our management team with the addition of mark hoffman as chief operating officer 
mr 
hoffman began a strategic evaluation of our infrastructure needs  including senior management  systems  distribution facilities and merchandising strategy 
in july  mr 
hoffman was promoted to chief executive officer  and mr 
zeichner became chairman of the board of directors 
we consider a store comparable after it has been open for full months 
at the end of fiscal  of the charlotte russe stores were included in the comparable store base  compared to of the stores open at the end of fiscal at the end of fiscal  of the rampage stores were included in the comparable store base  compared to of the stores open at the end of fiscal in the five fiscal years ended september   we grew from stores to stores  representing a compound annual growth rate of  and increased our annual revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we experienced successive quarters of comparable store sales declines through the first quarter of fiscal that resulted in a decline in average annual sales per store 
as a result  beginning in late fiscal  we began to initiate a series of management and operational changes intended to improve our merchandise assortments  in store presentation and financial performance 
our sales trends improved during the second and third quarters of fiscal which contributed to improved profitability 
during the fourth quarter ending in september  however  sales slowed down as offerings at the charlotte russe stores failed to reflect enough wear now summer fashion due to an early conversion to early fall assortments 
at the same time  the repositioning of the rampage brand had become more difficult as more of the merchandise reflected elevated initial retail prices and corresponding elevations of product quality  fabrication  fit and detailing 
management acknowledged that it would take time to attract targeted customers to the elevated assortments  and it estimated that the rampage stores would continue to experience negative comparable sales trends during the first half of fiscal sales for the first half of fiscal were disappointing 
offerings at the charlotte russe stores had not met with customer acceptance and the anticipated progression of improvements at the rampage stores had not materialized 
however  during the third quarter of fiscal  the success of the rampage brand repositioning was evidenced by the return to positive comparable store sales  while sales at the charlotte russe stores benefited from our decision to increase the presentation of denim in our stores 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the charlotte russe chain experienced improved selling of apparel merchandise  in particular our refuge branded denim and fast fashion tops  while the rampage chain continued to focus on repositioning of the brand and build customer recognition for assortments that target aspirational branded retailers 
comparable store sales increased for the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to a decrease of for the fourth quarter of fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of sales  and store information for the periods indicated 
fiscal year net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses store closing costs operating income interest income  net other charges  net income before income taxes income taxes net income number of stores open at end of period fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
our net sales increased to million from million  an increase of  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase reflects million of additional net sales from the new stores opened during fiscal as well as other stores opened in prior fiscal years that did not qualify as comparable stores 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales  which resulted in decreased sales of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
gross profit 
gross profit represents net sales less cost of goods sold  which includes buying  distribution and occupancy costs 
our gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily the result of higher net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to from 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales was principally due to decreased product gross margins as higher markdown expense more than offset higher initial markup 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was attributable to new store expansion and increased corporate expenses  specifically higher store payroll and operating expenses and higher central office payroll and related expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to from primarily due to higher corporate expenses including the costs for the tentative settlement of two class action lawsuits 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was 
this rate is lower than last year s rate as we adjusted our tax liabilities to reflect the reassessment of tax contingency balances for fiscal net income 
our net income decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily due to an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  which was partially offset by an increase in gross profit and a decrease in income taxes 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales

as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to from primarily due to higher store payroll expenses 
store closing costs 
fiscal includes a pre tax reversal of  of costs previously incurred in fiscal associated with the closure of charlotte s room stores 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate of approximates our statutory income tax rates 
net income 
our net income increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit which was partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  reduction in store closing costs  and an increase in income taxes 
quarterly results and seasonality we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by strong sales during the back to school  easter and winter holiday seasons 
the strength of each of these three seasons generally provides relatively balanced sales during our first  third and fourth fiscal quarters 
we typically experience lower net sales and net income during the second quarter of each fiscal year 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays  as well as other factors discussed in the section entitled risks relating to our business 
the following table includes our unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters during the two year period ended september  this data has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
we believe that this information has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and that all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

our capital requirements result primarily from capital expenditures related to new store openings 
we have historically satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations  although we have also used borrowings under prior credit facilities in the past for acquisitions  including our acquisition and the acquisition of the rampage stores 
due to the rapid turnover of our inventory  we generate trade payables and other accrued liabilities sufficient to offset most  if not all  of our working capital requirements  and this allows us to generally operate with limited working capital 
as of september   we had working capital of approximately million which included cash and cash equivalents of million 
during fiscal years  and  our net cash provided by operations amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal year  our net cash provided by operations decreased as a result of lower net income  a decrease in deferred tax assets and net changes in working capital accounts  offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and an increase in landlord construction allowances 
our net cash used in investing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the primary component related to purchases of fixed assets  which consists of new store openings  the upgrade of our information systems and other corporate expenditures 
we opened a total of  and new stores during the fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to invest in capital expenditures to support our growth 
based on our experience with store openings for our two concepts  we estimate that the average net investment to open these new stores is approximately  which includes capital expenditures  net of landlord contributions  and initial inventory  net of payables 
all new stores opened since our acquisition in fiscal generated average net sales of approximately million and store level operating cash flow of approximately  during their first year of operation representing an average cash return on investment of approximately 
for the stores opened in the three years ended fiscal  we achieved average net sales of approximately million and store level operating cash flow of approximately  during their first year of operation representing an average cash return on investment of approximately 
after taking into account new store construction  existing store remodeling  distribution center expenditures  and other corporate capital projects  total capital expenditures for fiscal year are projected to range from approximately to million 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
financing activities primarily consist of the proceeds of stock option exercises 
we currently have a million secured revolving credit facility the credit facility with bank of america  na  which expires on june  under the term of the credit facility  we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit of million less any outstanding letters of credit  and we have set the initial loan ceiling amount at million 
interest on the credit facility is payable quarterly  at our option  at either i the bank s prime rate plus to base rate  or ii to over the average interest settlement rate for deposits in the london interbank market banks eurodollar rate subject to certain adjustments 
our ability to receive loan advances under the credit facility is subject to our continued compliance with various covenants  representations and warranties  and conditions  including but not limited to negative covenants against the incurrence of debt or liens 
the credit facility also contains events of default customary for facilities of this type and provides that  upon the occurrence of an event of default  payment of all outstanding loans may be accelerated and or the lenders commitments may be terminated 
pursuant to this agreement  we and our wholly owned subsidiaries have i provided an unconditional guarantee of the full and punctual payment of obligations under the credit facility  ii pledged certain securities of the company s subsidiaries to the collateral agent as security for the full payment and performance of our obligations under the credit facility and iii granted a security interest in essentially all of our personal property as security for the full payment and performance of our obligations under the credit facility 
at september   there was no outstanding debt under the credit facility and we were in compliance with the terms of the bank credit agreement 
as of september   we had million of borrowing availability under the credit facility 
we believe that cash flows from operations  our current cash balance and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated capital expenditure requirements for fiscal if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
letters of credit pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  the company can issue up to million of documentary or standby letters of credit 
the outstanding commitments under this agreement at september  totaled approximately million  including million in standby letters of credit 
contractual obligations the company s commitment to make future payments under long term contractual obligations was as follows  as of september  contractual obligations total less than year years years after years dollars in thousands operating leases other long term obligations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments regarding inventories  receivables  fixed assets  intangible assets  accrued liabilities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results from this evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  alternative estimates and judgments could be derived which would differ from the estimates being used by management 
actual results could differ from any or all of these estimates 
as a retailer of women s apparel and accessories  our financial statements are affected by several critical accounting policies  many of which affect management s use of estimates and judgments  as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we sell merchandise directly to retail customers and recognize revenue at the point of sale 
customers have the right to return merchandise to us  and we maintain a reserve for the financial impact of returns which occur subsequent to the current reporting period 
our policy with respect to gift cards is to record revenue as the gift cards are redeemed for merchandise 
prior to their redemption  unredeemed gift cards are recorded as a liability  included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
revenue recognized from gift card forfeitures is based upon an expected forfeiture rate determined from historical trends and for each period presented has had an immaterial financial statement impact 
our merchandise is initially offered for sale at a regular price  but is often marked down prior to the ultimate sale of all such units 
we utilize the retail method of accounting for our inventory valuation that inherently reduces the inventories carrying value as markdowns are initiated 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for the financial impact of markdowns that we believe are likely to be encountered in the future 
if actual demand or market conditions are more or less favorable than those projected by management  the level of the reserve for future markdowns would be subject to change in subsequent reporting periods 
we also provide for estimated inventory losses for damaged  lost or stolen inventory for the period from the last physical inventory to the financial statement date 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other factors 
we receive certain allowances from our vendors primarily related to distribution center handling expenses or defective merchandise 
these allowances are reflected as a reduction of merchandise inventory in the period they are received and allocated to cost of sales during the period in which the items were sold 
we have recorded a goodwill asset that arose from the acquisition of our business in september this asset is tested for possible impairment on at least an annual basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
the carrying value of investments in our stores  principally leasehold improvements and equipment  and other operations is reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in prior years  we established reserves for stores which have been closed  and no other stores are contemplated for closure at this time 
our estimates in testing for possible impairment may be based upon a number of factors  including assumptions about the projected future cash flows  discount rate  growth rate or changes to our business operations 
changes in our estimates may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 
rent expense on noncancellable leases containing known future scheduled rent increases are recorded on a straight line basis over the respective leases beginning when we receive possession of the leased property for construction purposes 
the difference between rent expense and rent paid is accounted for as deferred rent 
landlord construction allowances and other such lease incentives are recorded as deferred lease credits  and are amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction to rent expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and supersedes fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior periods presented  sfas no 
requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods  sfas no 
requires that the new accounting principle be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
sfas no 
shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the provisions of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value  effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  the fasb concluded that companies can adopt the new standard in one of two ways the modified prospective transition method  in which the company would recognize share based employee compensation from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date  or the modified retrospective transition method  in which a company would recognize employee compensation cost for periods presented prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  pursuant to which a company would recognize employee compensation cost in the amounts reported in the pro forma disclosures provided in accordance with sfas no 
we will adopt sfas no 
r during the first quarter of fiscal and will use the modified prospective transition method 
the impact of this statement on our financial statements or our results of operations in and beyond will depend upon various factors  including the amount of awards granted and the fair value of those awards at the time of grant 
we currently expect to incur incremental pre tax expense of approximately million during fiscal as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our statement of income and our cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of september   we had no borrowings against our credit facility 
however  we may borrow additional funds under our revolving credit facility as needed 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are considered to be cash equivalents and are shown that way on our balance sheet 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we believe our market risk exposure is minimal 
forward looking statements we have made statements under the captions  business  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and risks relating to our business  as well as in other sections of this annual report on form k  that are forward looking statements 
you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as may  will  expect  intend  anticipate  believe  estimate and continue or similar words 
these forward looking statements may also use different phrases 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
these forward looking statements  which are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions about us  may include  among other things  projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition  our anticipated growth strategies  successful repositioning of our rampage brand  integration of our recently hired senior executives  and general and regional economic conditions  industry trends  consumer demands and preferences  competition from other retailers and uncertainties generally associated with women s apparel and accessory retailing 
there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or which we do not fully control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
because these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements  including shopping mall traffic and shopping patterns  timing of openings for new shopping malls or our stores  fashion trends  national or regional economic influences  and weather 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this annual report on form k might not occur 
risks relating to our business our success depends on our ability to identify and rapidly respond to consumer fashion tastes 
the apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends and shifting consumer demands 
accordingly  our success is heavily dependent both on the priority our target customers place on fashion and on our ability to anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends in a timely manner 
current fashion tastes place significant emphasis on a fashionable look 
in the past this emphasis has increased and decreased through fashion cycles and decreased emphasis has adversely affected our results 
if we do not anticipate  identify or react appropriately and timely to changes in styles  trends  desired images or brand preferences  it may lead to  among other things  excess inventories and higher markdowns  as well as decreased appeal of our brands 
we intend to continue to open new stores  which could strain our resources and cause us to operate our business less effectively 
our growth will largely depend on successfully opening and operating new stores 
during fiscal  we opened new stores and closed rampage store representing a net increase from the number of stores open at the end of fiscal we plan to open up to new charlotte russe stores during fiscal  an increase of from total stores opened as of september  we intend to continue to increase our number of stores for at least the next several years 
in order to support our planned expansion we will need to continually monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems 
this expansion also will place increased demand on our managerial  operational  and administrative resources 
these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less effectively  which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our individual stores and slow our new store growth 
our planned expansion involves a number of risks that could prevent or delay the successful opening of new stores as well as impact the performance of our existing stores 
our ability to open and operate new stores successfully depends on many factors  including  among others  our ability to identify suitable store locations  the availability of which is outside of our control  negotiate acceptable lease terms  including desired tenant improvement allowances  source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores  hire  train and retain store personnel  successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations  and identify and satisfy the fashion preferences of new geographic areas 
in addition  some of our new stores will be opened in regions of the united states in which we currently have few or no stores 
the expansion into new markets may present competitive  merchandising and distribution challenges that are different from those currently encountered in our existing markets 
any of these challenges could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent our new store openings are in existing markets  we may experience reduced net sales volumes in existing stores in those markets 
a decline in general economic conditions may lead to reduced consumer demand for our apparel and accessories 
consumer spending habits  including spending for the fashionable apparel and related accessories that we sell  are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
a general slowdown in the united states economy and an uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect consumer spending habits and mall traffic  which could result in lower net sales than expected and could cause us to slow our expansion plans 
our stores are heavily dependent on the customer traffic generated by shopping malls 
most of our store locations are not sufficiently concentrated to make significant marketing expenditures cost effective 
as a result  we depend heavily on locating our stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls in order to generate customer traffic 
we cannot control the development of new shopping malls  the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls or the success of individual shopping malls 
our market share may be adversely impacted at any time by a significant number of competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by low barriers to entry 
we compete against a diverse group of retailers  including national and local specialty retail stores  regional retail chains  traditional department stores and  to a lesser extent  mass merchandisers 
our market share and results of operations may be adversely impacted by this significant number of competitors 
many of our competitors also are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do 
we rely on our good relationships with vendors to implement our business strategy successfully 
our business is dependent on continued good relations with our vendors 
in particular  we believe that we generally are able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors because we are perceived as a desirable customer 
our test and reorder merchandise strategy also relies in large part on our ability to obtain much of our merchandise from our vendors within three to six weeks from the date of order 
our failure to maintain good relations with our vendors could increase our exposure to changing fashion cycles  which may in turn lead to increased inventory markdown rates 
certain members of our senior management team have limited tenure with us 
our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization in order to timely deliver and display fashionable merchandise in appropriate quantities in our stores 
this execution requires experienced and talented management 
if we fail to attract  motivate and retain qualified and talented key personnel  it may adversely affect our business and inhibit our plans for future growth 
during fiscal  we hired a new senior vice president of apparel for charlotte russe and a vice president of stores 
each of these individuals has significant experience in these and similar roles with other apparel retailers  although they have limited tenure with our company 
if at any time our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations decline or do not meet the expectations of research analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
our quarterly results of operations for our individual stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
for instance  our quarterly comparable store sales percentages have ranged as high as positive and as low as negative over the past two years 
our net sales and operating results are typically lower in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to the traditional retail slowdown immediately following the winter holiday season 
our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings and the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores  efforts to reposition the targeted customer for our rampage stores  fashion trends  calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  the effectiveness of our test and reorder strategy in maintaining appropriate inventory levels  changes in our merchandise mix  timing of promotional events  general economic conditions and  in particular  the retail sales environment  actions by competitors or mall anchor tenants  weather conditions  and the level of pre opening expenses associated with new stores 
our business and reputation may be adversely affected if our rampage stores are associated with negative publicity related to the use of the rampage trademark by other parties 
in connection with the acquisition of our rampage stores  we acquired the exclusive right within the united states to use the rampage trademark on exterior and interior signage identifying our rampage stores  as well as the non exclusive right within the united states to use the rampage trademark for promotional and advertising materials 
we do not  however  have the right to use the rampage trademark on our merchandise 
the right to market merchandise under the rampage trademark was retained by rampage clothing company 
further  nothing in our license agreement with rampage clothing company prohibits the sale of merchandise bearing the rampage trademark by other parties or the licensing of the rampage trademark to other parties 
in fact  rampage clothing company has licensed the trademark to other parties 
we believe a positive rampage brand image is important to our success 
accordingly  if the merchandise sold by the rampage clothing company or other parties under the rampage trademark is of low quality or if the rampage clothing company or these parties otherwise engage in activities that negatively affect the rampage trademark or are otherwise inconsistent with our rampage store concept  consumers could lose confidence in our merchandise and our reputation and business could be materially adversely affected 
the failure to efficiently complete the planned replacement of certain of our technology and information systems could negatively impact our business 
the efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent on information systems 
in particular  we rely upon technology and information systems for inventory control and other critical information 
we periodically review  improve and  under certain circumstances  replace information systems to provide enhanced support to all operating areas 
if such upgrades and enhancements are not successfully implemented  then the current systems may not be able to continue to adequately support our information requirements 
we have recently initiated the replacement of our existing inventory software systems 
if we are unable to complete this conversion in an efficient and timely manner  our business could be negatively impacted 
our operations  as well as a substantial number of our stores  are concentrated in the southwest and other heavily populated regional areas  which makes us susceptible to adverse conditions in these regions 
our headquarters and distribution centers are located in california  and a substantial number of our stores are located in california  florida and texas 
as a result  our business may be more susceptible to regional factors than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors 
these factors include  among others  economic and weather conditions  demographic and population changes  and fashion tastes 
further  a natural disaster or other catastrophic event  such as an earthquake affecting southern california  or hurricanes affecting the southeastern states and texas  could significantly disrupt our operations 
the loss of  or disruption of operations in  either of our two distribution centers could negatively impact our business 
our merchandise is distributed through two modern facilities that use automated systems for sorting apparel and shipping merchandise 
we depend on the orderly operation of our facilities and distribution processes  as well as sufficient shipping resources 
disruptions in these operations due to fire  earthquake or other catastrophic events  employee matters including work stoppages  shipping problems or other events could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores 
our business could be adversely impacted by unfavorable international conditions 
we receive apparel and other merchandise from foreign sources  both purchased directly in foreign markets and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources 
to the extent that any of our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products  any event causing a disruption of imports  including the imposition of import restrictions  could harm our ability to source product 
this disruption could materially limit the merchandise that we would have available for sale and reduce our revenues and earnings 
the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability  or war  in or affecting any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured or through which they flow 
trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas  or both  that are applicable to the products that we sell also could affect the import of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us 
any material increase in tariff levels  or any material decrease in quota levels or available quota allocation  could negatively impact our business 
further  changes in tariffs or quotas for merchandise imported from individual foreign countries could lead us to shift our sources of supply among various countries 
any such shift we undertake in the future could result in a disruption of our sources of supply and lead to a reduction in our revenues and earnings 
supply chain security initiatives undertaken by the us government that impede the normal flow of product could also negatively impact our business 
the effects of war or acts of terrorism could adversely affect our business 
the continued threat of terrorism  heightened security measures and military action in response to an act of terrorism has disrupted commerce and has intensified the uncertainty of the united states economy 
any further acts of terrorism  particularly directed at malls  or new or extended hostilities may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence  which could negatively impact our sales by causing mall traffic or consumer spending to decline
