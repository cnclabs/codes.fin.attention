overview from to our revenues grew at an annual compounded growth rate of approximately 
this was achieved by implementing our three part growth strategy of new product development  strategic partnerships and acquisitions 
generally  this strategy has historically provided us with strong organic growth in good economic times  and in tough economic times  such as we experienced in and  it has provided us with strong revenue growth through acquisitions 
for our revenue growth is below our historic levels  which is primarily due to a decline of million in sales at our genomic solutions subsidiary 
our revenue grew approximately in over during and  although we continued with new product development and strategic partnerships  which did contribute to revenues  our revenue growth was primarily attributable to acquisitions 
with the acquisitions of union biometrica in may  genomic solutions in october  genemachines in march and biorobotics in september  an increasing portion of our revenues is the result of sales of relatively high priced products  considered to be capital equipment 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from capital equipment products 
the capital equipment market has a tendency to be volatile and is much more seasonal compared to our traditional catalog business and as such  we believe we have experienced  and we believe we will continue to experience  substantial fluctuations in our quarterly revenues 
reduced demand  delays in purchase orders  receipt  manufacture or shipment of products or receivables collection of these relatively high priced products have lead to substantial variability in our revenues  operating results and working capital requirements from quarter to quarter 
additionally  the cyclical buying pattern of the capital equipment purchasing market could mask or exaggerate the economic trends underlying the market for our capital equipment product lines 
specifically  a decline in any quarter that is typically a quarter that we would expect to contribute less than one fourth of the projected revenue for the year  could be misinterpreted if the decline is instead attributable to a negative trend in the market and or in the demand for our products 
conversely  an increase in capital equipment purchasing in any quarter that is typically a quarter which we would expect to contribute less than one quarter of projected revenue for the year  could be misinterpreted as a favorable trend in the market and or in the demand for our products 
in general  we believe that we have seen  particularly in the last half of and in  a strengthening in the economy 
however  we do believe that the economy is still uncertain  with the outlook for the genomics and proteomics markets looking particularly uncertain 
while we are optimistic that we can return to solid organic growth in addition to growth from acquisitions  we are unable to determine if the growth in the areas we have seen is a trend that is likely to continue  or are even a trend 
additionally  the revenues we achieved in the genomics  proteomics and high throughput screening product lines were lower than that achieved in  not just due to an uncertain economy  but also we believe due to the lack of focus devoted to these product lines in and in the first half of we are continuing to monitor both the market  as well as our internal resources  as we pursue our goal of maintaining and or improving the operating metrics of the company  and accordingly during the second quarter of  we implemented an action plan  including a restructuring plan at our genomic solutions subsidiary  which we believe will enable us to bring our genomics  proteomics and high throughput screening product lines back in line with our goal of solid operating metrics and profitability across all product lines and operations 
the costs associated with this action plan had an adverse impact on the earnings results 
generally  management evaluates the financial performance of its operations before the effects of stock compensation expense and before the effects of purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions 
our goal is to develop and sell products that profitably accelerate drug discovery and as such we monitor the operating metrics of the company and when appropriate effect organizational changes to leverage infrastructure and distribution channels 
these changes may be effected as a result of various events  including acquisitions  weakened economy  soft market conditions and personnel changes 
during we entered into a million revolving credit facility with brown brothers harriman co  under which we have drawn down approximately million as of december  we believe that the financial covenants contained in the credit facility involving income  debt coverage and cash flow  as well as minimum working capital requirements are covenants that we will continue to be in compliance with under current operating plans 
the credit facility also contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
additionally  the facility requires creditor approval for acquisitions funded with cash in excess of million and for those which may be funded with equity in excess of million 
we do not believe that these requirements will be a significant constraint on our operations or on the acquisition portion of our growth strategy 
as of december   we had available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million 
historically  we have funded acquisitions with debt  capital raised by issuing equity and cash flow from operations 
in order to continue the acquisition portion of our three part growth strategy beyond what our current cash balances and cash flow from operations can support we will need to raise more capital  either by incurring additional debt  issuing equity or a combination 
currently  we are prohibited from accessing the public debt or equity markets until we are able to provide historical audited financial statements for a previous acquisition or until such financial statements are no longer required to be provided by sec regulations 
we are in the process of seeking to complete these audited financial statements and  once we complete these audited financial statements  we will be able to register our debt or equity securities using form s or other appropriate form of registration statement 
however  until this matter is resolved  our ability to raise capital may be limited to private equity transactions and or additional borrowing and may result in entering into an agreement on less than favorable terms 
in the table below  we provide an overview of the selected operating metrics 
selected operating metrics in thousands of revenue of revenue of revenue total revenues    cost of product revenues sales and marketing expense    research and development expense    general administrative expense   revenues 
we generate revenues by selling instruments  devices and consumables through our catalog  our direct sales force  our distributors and our website 
for products primarily priced under  every one to three years  we intend to distribute a new  comprehensive catalog initially in a series of bulk mailings  first to our existing customers  followed by mailings to targeted markets of potential customers 
over the life of the catalog  distribution will also be made periodically to potential and existing customers through direct mail and trade shows and in response to e mail and telephone inquiries 
from time to time  we also intend to distribute catalog supplements that promote selected areas of our catalog or new products to targeted subsets of our customer base 
future distributions of our comprehensive catalog and our catalog supplements will be determined primarily by the incidence of new product introductions  which cannot be predicted 
our end user customers are research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and government laboratories 
revenue from catalog sales in any period is a function of time elapsed since the last mailing of the catalog  the number of catalogs mailed and the number of new items included in the catalog 
we launched our latest comprehensive catalog in march  with approximately  pages and approximately  copies printed 
revenues direct to end users  derived through our catalog and the electronic version of our catalog on our website  represented approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we do not currently have the capability to accept purchase orders through our website 
products sold under brand names of distributors including ge healthcare formerly amersham biosciences  are typically priced in the range of   they are mainly scientific instruments like spectrophotometers and plate readers that analyze light to detect and quantify a very wide range of molecular and cellular processes or apparatus like gel electrophoresis units 
we also use distributors for both our catalog products and our higher priced products  for sales in locations where we do not have subsidiaries or where we have distributors in place for acquired businesses 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from sales to distributors 
for our higher priced products  which are typically priced over  and deemed capital equipment  we have direct sales organizations which consist of sales and marketing personnel  customer support  technical support and field application service support 
these organizations have been structured to attend to the specific needs associated with the promotion and support of higher priced capital equipment customers 
the combined expertise of both our sales and technical support staff provide a balanced skill set when promoting the relevant products at seminars  on site demonstrations and exhibitions which are done routinely 
the expertise of our field service personnel provides complete post sale customer support for instrument specific service  repair and maintenance  and applications support 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from sales by our direct sales force 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from products we manufacture or from collaboration and research grant projects 
the remaining and  respectively  of our revenues for the years ended december  and  were derived from complementary products we distribute in order to provide the researcher with a single source for all equipment needed to conduct a particular experiment 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from sales made by our non us operations 
a large portion of our international sales during this period consisted of sales to ge healthcare formerly amersham biosciences  the distributor for our spectrophotometers and plate readers 
ge healthcare distributes these products to customers around the world  including to many customers in the united states  from its distribution center in upsalla  sweden 
as a result  we believe our international sales would have been a lower percentage of our revenues if we had shipped our products directly to our end users 
changes in the relative proportion of our revenue sources between catalog sales  direct sales  and distribution sales are the result of a different sales proportion of acquired companies 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  obsolescence charges  packaging costs  warranty costs  shipping costs and royalties 
our costs of product revenues may vary over time based on the mix of products sold 
we sell products that we manufacture and products that we purchase from third parties 
the products that we purchase from third parties have higher cost of goods sold because the profit is effectively shared with the original manufacturer 
we anticipate that our manufactured products will continue to have a lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues as compared with the cost of non manufactured products for the foreseeable future 
additionally our cost of product revenues as a percent of product revenues will vary based on mix of direct end user sales and distributor sales 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology and human relations functions 
other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting services  restructuring costs  facility costs  investor relations  insurance and provision for doubtful accounts 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in sales  marketing and customer support functions 
we also incur costs for travel  trade shows  demonstration equipment  public relations and marketing materials  consisting primarily of the printing and distribution of our approximately  page catalog  supplements and various other specialty catalogs  and the maintenance of our websites 
we may from time to time expand our marketing efforts by employing additional technical marketing specialists in an effort to increase sales of selected categories of products in our catalog 
we may also from time to time expand our direct sales organizations in an effort to increase and or support sales of our higher priced capital equipment instruments or to concentrate on key accounts or promote certain product lines 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel and capital resources used to develop and enhance our products and to support collaboration agreements 
other research and development expense includes fees for consultants and outside service providers  and material costs for prototype and test units 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue to make these investments in order to realize the potential of new technologies that we develop  license or acquire 
stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense resulting from stock option grants to our employees represents the difference between the fair market value and the exercise price of the stock options on the grant date for those options considered fixed awards 
stock compensation is amortized as a charge to operations using an accelerated vesting method in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  which results in decreasing compensation expense from the date of the stock option grant until the vesting dates 
in addition  upon the acceleration of vesting pursuant to separation agreements  the company will record stock compensation expense equal to the difference between the fair market value and the exercise price related to the options which were accelerated 
stock compensation expense is included as a component of cost of product sales  sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  and general and administrative expenses as appropriate 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period of the increase in revenues was primarily due to the acquisitions of hoefer and kd scientific which increased revenues by approximately million and a positive impact from sales denominated in foreign currencies which increased revenues by approximately million  a majority of which was at biochrom 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales at genomic solutions of approximately million 
the favorable foreign exchange effect for the year ended december  is due primarily to the strengthening of the british pound sterling and the euro against the us dollar 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues increased million or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in the cost of product revenues was primarily due to the factors which contributed to the growth in revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  cost of product revenues for the years ended december  and was for both periods 
for the year ended december   approximately million of the cost of product revenues was related to fair value adjustments of inventory and backlog acquired from biorobotics and hoefer for products which were sold in for the year ended december   approximately million of the cost of product revenues was related to fair value adjustments of inventory and backlog acquired from genomic solutions  btx  genemachines  biorobotics and hoefer for products which were sold in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in approximately million of the increase is attributable to additional costs of sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and approximately million of the increase is attributable to acquisitions made in and in addition  approximately million of the increase is the result of restructuring costs at our biochrom  genomic solutions and warner instruments subsidiaries  due to the closure of facilities and realignment of our business strategy 
we expect the costs of sarbanes oxley compliance efforts to be approximately million in sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased million  or  to million in from million in due primarily to a general increase in spending on sales and marketing initiatives and acquisitions made in and partially offset by approximately million due to the closing of the genomic solutions japanese sales office 
research and development expense 
research and development spending  which includes expenses related to research revenues  was million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to acquisitions made in and amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangibles was million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in this increase is primarily attributed to acquisitions made in and other income expense  net 
other expense  net  for of  included approximately  net interest expense compared to net interest expense of  for the same period in this increase in net interest expense is due to cash and interest bearing debt being increasingly used to fund acquisitions since other expense  net  for also included a  foreign exchange gain compared to a  gain for the same period last year 
other than intercompany debt that is considered as long term in nature  these exchange gains are primarily the result of currency fluctuations on intercompany transactions between our subsidiaries 
other expense for included approximately  in charges related to the settlement of an arbitration award in favor of the former shareholders of our union biometrica subsidiary 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rates were for and for the decrease in the effective income tax rate is principally due to the company incurring a lesser amount of nondeductible expenses in the united states while incurring operating losses in jurisdictions that have greater higher effective income tax rates  principally the united states  and earning operating income in foreign jurisdictions with lower effective income tax rates 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in revenues was primarily due to the acquisition of genomic solutions and genemachines which increased revenues by approximately million and a positive impact from sales denominated in foreign currencies which increased revenues by approximately million  a majority of which was at biochrom 
the favorable foreign exchange effect for the year is due primarily to the strengthening of the british pound sterling and the euro against the us dollar 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in approximately million of increase in cost of product revenues is primarily due to our acquisition of genomic solutions in october and genemachines in as a percentage of total revenues  cost of product revenues for was and for was 
for  approximately million of the cost of product revenues was related to fair value adjustments of inventory and backlog acquired from genomic solutions  btx  genemachines  biorobotics and hoefer for products which were sold in for  approximately of the cost of product revenues was related to fair value adjustments of inventory and backlog acquired from genomic solutions for products which were sold in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in from million in a portion of the increase is due to the effects of our acquisitions and our acquisitions having a full year impact on spending compared to a partial year impact in approximately million 
the balance of the increase in spending over was due primarily to increased costs for insurance partially offset by a decrease in bonus earned under the bonus plan compared to the bonus plan approximately million and legal expense related to arbitration proceedings approximately million 
these increases were offset by restructuring expenses of approximately million incurred during for restructuring at our union biometrica and genomic solutions subsidiaries 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expense decreased from in to in sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased million  or  to million in from million in due primarily to the acquisitions of genomic solutions and genemachines made during and as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expense was in compared to in this increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to the higher costs associated with the direct sales force at our genomic solutions subsidiary of approximately million  which we acquired in october  compared to the traditional spending rate for sales through a catalog or through distributors that we have historically experienced 
research and development expense 
research and development spending  which includes expenses related to research revenues  was million in compared to million for the same period in this net increase is primarily due to acquisitions made during and as a percentage of revenues  research and development was for both and in process research and development expense 
as of the date of the acquisition of genomic solutions in  we recorded million of in process research and development expense representing the estimated fair value of acquired research and development projects with no alternative future use 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of intangibles  including amortization of acquired technologies  was million in compared to million in this increase is primarily attributed to acquisitions made in and other income expense  net 
other expense  net for of million included approximately million in charges related to an arbitration award in favor of the former stockholders of union biometrica 
other expense  net for also included net interest expense of approximately million compared to net interest income of million for this shift from interest income to interest expense is due to cash and interest bearing debt being increasingly used to fund acquisitions since other expense  net for also included a million foreign exchange gain compared to a million gain for the same period last year 
other than intercompany debt that is treated as a long term investment  these exchange gains and losses are primarily related to transactions between our subsidiaries 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rates were for and for notwithstanding the effects of the nondeductible charges related to a one time arbitration award in  in process research and development charges for and certain stock compensation expense for and the company s effective income tax rates were for and for liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our business through cash provided by operating activities  the issuance of common stock and preferred stock  and bank borrowings 
our liquidity requirements have arisen primarily from investing activities  including funding of acquisitions and capital expenditures 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million which represents an increase of approximately million from december  primarily driven by positive operating cash flow 
as of december   we had approximately million outstanding under our credit facility  an increase of approximately million from december  the net increase in the credit facility primarily resulted from million of borrowings to fund the acquisition of kd scientific offset by million of cash repayments 
overview of cash flows for the year ended december  in thousands cash flows from operations net income   adjust non cash items    changes in assets and liabilities    cash provided by operations   investing activities acquisition of businesses    other investing activities    cash used in investing activities    financing activities cash provided by debt  net    other financing activities  cash provided by used in financing activities   exchange effect on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   our operating activities generated cash of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase in cash flow from operations was primarily the result of decreases in accounts receivable due to improved collection efforts  a decrease in other assets due to the timing of cash payments and an increase in deferred revenue 
these items were offset by a decrease in trade accounts payable which was primarily due to the timing of cash payments 
our investing activities used cash of million in compared to million for the same period in in  approximately million was used to fund the acquisition of kd scientific which is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements and approximately million in additions of property  plant and equipment 
during the next twelve months the company expects to spend between million and million on capital expenditures 
our financing activities have historically consisted of borrowings under a revolving credit facility  long term debt and the issuance of preferred stock and common stock  including the common stock issued in our initial public offering 
financing activities provided cash of million during compared to million during we ended the year with approximately million drawn against our million credit facility  an increase of approximately million since december  the net increase in the credit facility resulted from million of borrowings to fund the acquisition of kd scientific offset by million of cash repayments 
during  we entered into a million bridge loan with brown brothers harriman co 
in anticipation of closing the million credit facility 
the bridge loan was repaid in full with the proceeds of the million credit facility which we entered into in november as of december   we had available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
based on our current operations and current operating plans  we expect that our available cash  cash generated from current operations and debt capacity will be sufficient to finance current operations and capital expenditures for months and beyond 
however  we may use substantial amounts of capital to accelerate product development or expand our sales and marketing activities 
we may need to raise additional capital in order to make significant acquisitions 
additional capital raising activities will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we raise capital by issuing equity securities 
currently  we are prohibited from accessing the public debt or equity markets until we are able to provide historical audited financial statements for a previous acquisition or until such financial statements are no longer required to be provided by sec regulations 
we are in the process of seeking to complete these audited financial statements and  once we complete these audited financial statements  we will be able to register our debt or equity securities using form s or other appropriate form of registration statement 
however  until this matter is resolved  our ability to raise capital may be limited to private equity transactions and or additional borrowing and may result in entering into an agreement on less than favorable terms 
in addition  our credit facility with brown brothers harriman contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requires creditor approval for acquisitions funded with cash in excess of million and for those which may be funded with equity in excess of million 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital on favorable terms or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations the following schedule represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligation total and beyond in s notes payable capital leases  including imputed interest operating leases     total      critical accounting policies we believe that our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  inventory  valuation of identifiable intangible assets and in process research and development in business combinations  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and accounting for income taxes revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue of products when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
sales of some of our products include provisions to provide additional services such as installation and training 
the company evaluates all sales with multiple deliverables  including our collaboration agreements  to determine if more than one unit of accounting exists  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when the company determines that there is more than one unit of accounting  and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
in situations where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value s of the undelivered item s in an arrangement but no such evidence for the delivered item s the company applies the residual method to allocate fair value 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item s equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered item s 
revenue for each unit of accounting is recorded once all applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
service agreements on our equipment are typically sold separately from the sale of the equipment 
revenues on these service agreements are recognized ratably over the life of the agreement  typically one year  in accordance with fasb technical bulletin ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
the company accounts for shipping and handling fees and costs in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  which requires all amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling to be classified as revenues 
the company s costs incurred related to shipping and handling are classified as cost of product revenues 
warranties and product returns are estimated and accrued for at the time sales are recorded 
the company has no obligations to customers after the date products are shipped or installed  if applicable  other than pursuant to warranty obligations and service or maintenance contracts 
the company provides for the estimated amount of future returns upon shipment of products or installation  if applicable  based on historical experience 
while product returns and warranty costs have historically not been significant  they have been within our expectations and the provisions established  however  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same return rates and warranty repair costs that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product return rates or a significant increase in the cost to repair our products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or increased costs materialize 
accounting for income taxes 
we are required to determine our annual income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves determining our current and deferred income tax expense as well as accounting for differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the future tax consequences attributable to these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to the extent we believe that recovery does not meet this more likely than not standard as required in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we must establish a valuation allowance 
if a valuation allowance is established or increased in a period  we must allocate the related income tax expense to income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of operations to the extent those deferred tax assets originated from continuing operations 
to the extent income tax benefits are allocated to stockholders equity  the related valuation allowance also must be allocated to stockholders equity 
management judgment and estimates are required in determining our income tax provision  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have established a valuation allowance attributable to certain temporary differences as we believe that a portion of the deferred tax assets at december  are not more likely than not to be realized in the carryback and carryforward periods based on the criteria set forth in sfas no 
we review the recoverability of deferred tax assets during each reporting period by reviewing previous estimates of future taxable income and comparing them to current estimates  and when appropriate  by reviewing possible tax planning strategies that would prevent the loss of the recoverability of any portion of the deferred tax asset that may occur due to expiration 
the company makes estimates evaluating its allowance for doubtful accounts 
on an ongoing basis  the company monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically not been significant  they have been within our expectations and the provisions established  however  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventory 
the company values its inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase first in  first out method and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost  based primarily on its estimated forecast of product demand 
since forecasted product demand quite often is a function of previous and current demand  a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  the company s industry is subject to technological change and new product development  and technological advances could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant adverse impact on the value of the company s inventory and its reported operating results 
valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks and acquired technology 
such intangible assets arise from the allocation of the purchase price of businesses acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on their respective fair market values 
amounts assigned to such identifiable intangible assets are primarily based on independent appraisals using established valuation techniques and management estimates 
the value assigned to trademarks was determined by estimating the royalty income that would be negotiated at an arm s length transaction if the asset were licensed from a third party 
a discount factor  ranging from to  which represents both the business and financial risks of such investments  was used to determine the present value of the future streams of income attributable to trademarks 
the specific approach used to value trademarks was the relief from royalty rfr method 
the rfr method assumes that an intangible asset is valuable because the owner of the asset avoids the cost of licensing that asset 
the royalty savings are then calculated by multiplying a royalty rate times a determined royalty base  ie  the applicable level of future revenues 
in determining an appropriate royalty rate  a sample of guideline  arm s length royalty and licensing agreements are analyzed 
in determining the royalty base  forecasts are used based on management s judgments of expected conditions and expected courses of actions 
the value assigned to acquired technology was determined by using a discounted cash flow model which measures what a buyer would be willing to pay currently for the future cash stream potential of existing technology 
the specific method used to value the technologies involved estimating future cash flows to be derived as a direct result of those technologies  and discounting those future streams to their present value 
the discount factors used  ranging from to  reflects the business and financial risks of an investment in technologies 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on management s judgment of expected conditions and expected courses of action 
valuation of in process research and development acquired in business combinations 
purchase price allocation to in process research and development represents the estimated fair value of research and development projects that are reasonably believed to have no alternative future use 
the value assigned to in process research and development was determined by independent appraisals by estimating the cost to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially feasible products  estimating the percentage of completion at the acquisition date  estimating the resulting net risk adjusted cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the discount rates used in determining the in process research and development expenditures reflects a higher risk of investment because of the higher level of uncertainty due in part to the nature of the company and the industry to constantly develop new technology for future product releases and ranged from to 
the forecasts used by the company in valuing in process research and development were based on assumptions the company believed at the time to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
given the uncertainties of the development process  no assurance can be given that deviations from the company s estimates will occur and no assurance can be given that the in process research and development projects identified will ever reach either technological or commercial success 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles with finite lives and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in who our competitors are and what they do  significant changes in our relationship with ge healthcare formerly amersham biosciences  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we were to determine that the value of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives was not recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the aforementioned factors  then the recoverability of those assets to be held and used would be measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of those assets to undiscounted future net cash flows before tax effects expected to be generated by those assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose 
in june  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets was issued 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other things  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but rather tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
the goodwill impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the company s reporting units with their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the company is required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that goodwill may be impaired 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of the intangible asset shall be its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
for unamortizable intangible assets if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset  the company would write down the unamortizable intangible asset to fair value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company performed its annual impairment tests on december   which did not indicate any impairment 
impact of foreign currencies we sell our products in many countries and a substantial portion of our sales  costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  especially the united kingdom pound sterling and the euro 
during and the us dollar weakened against these currencies resulting in increased consolidated revenue and earnings growth 
the gain associated with the translation of foreign equity into us dollars was approximately million  net of tax  for and  for  approximately million 
in addition  the currency fluctuations resulted in approximately  and  in foreign currency gains in and  respectively 
historically  we have not hedged our foreign currency position 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
however  as our sales expand internationally  we plan to evaluate our currency risks and we may enter into foreign exchange contracts from time to time to mitigate foreign currency exposure 
backlog our order backlog was approximately million as of december  and million as of december  we include in backlog only those orders for which we have received valid purchase orders 
purchase orders may be cancelled at any time prior to shipment 
our backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
we typically ship our backlog at any given time within days 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no

in december  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  was issued 
sfas no 
revised prescribes employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans 
the statement retains and revises the disclosure requirements contained in the original sfas no 
it also requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
the statement was generally effective for fiscal years ending after december   however as all of the company s pension plans covered by this statement are outside of the united states the provisions of sfas no 
were not applicable until the company adopted the applicable interim disclosure requirements of sfas no

the statement is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
impact of inflation we believe that our revenues and results of operations have not been significantly impacted by inflation during the past three years 
important factors that may affect future operating results our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on a number of factors  including our quarterly revenues will likely be affected by various factors  including the timing of capital equipment purchases by customers and the seasonal nature of purchasing in europe 
our quarterly revenues will likely be affected by various factors  including the volatility and seasonal timing of capital equipment purchases by customers and the volatile and seasonal nature of purchasing in europe 
our revenues may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including the seasonal nature of the capital equipment market  the timing of catalog mailings and new product introductions  future acquisitions and our substantial sales to european customers  who in summer months often defer purchases 
with the acquisitions of union biometrica in may  genomic solutions in october  genemachines in march and biorobotics in september  an increasing portion of our revenues are the result of sales of relatively high priced products  considered to be capital equipment 
the capital equipment market is very volatile and seasonal and as such  we will experience substantial fluctuations in our quarterly revenues 
additionally  reduced demand  delays in purchase orders  receipt  manufacture  shipment or receivables collection of these relatively high priced products could lead to substantial variability in revenues  operating results and working capital requirements from quarter to quarter  which could adversely affect our stock price 
in particular  delays or reduction in purchase orders from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could have a material adverse effect on us 
if we engage in any acquisition  we will incur a variety of costs  and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
our business strategy includes the future acquisition of businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
if we undertake any acquisition  the process of integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition as rapidly as expected or at all 
future acquisitions could reduce stockholders ownership  cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization expenses related to intangible assets with definite lives 
uncertain economic trends may adversely impact our business 
we have experienced and may continue to experience reduced demand for our products as a result of the uncertainty in the general economic environment in which we and our customers operate 
we cannot project the extent of the impact of the economic environment specific to our industry 
if economic conditions worsen or if an economic slowdown occurs  we may experience a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may misinterpret trends of our capital equipment product lines due to the cyclical nature of the capital equipment purchasing market 
the cyclical buying pattern of the capital equipment purchasing market could mask or exaggerate the economic trends underlying the market for our capital equipment product lines 
specifically  a decline in any quarter that is typically a quarter that we would expect to contribute less than one quarter projected revenue for the year  could be misinterpreted if the decline was due instead to a negative trend in the market or in the demand for our products 
conversely  an increase in any quarter that is typically a quarter that we would expect to contribute less than one quarter of projected revenue for the year  could be misinterpreted as a favorable trend in the market and in the demand for our products 
this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we may not realize the expected benefits of our recent acquisitions of btx  genemachines  biorobotics  hoefer and kd scientific due to difficulties integrating the businesses  operations and product lines 
our ability to achieve the benefits of our recent acquisitions of btx  genemachines  biorobotics  hoefer and kd scientific will depend in part on the integration and leveraging of technology  operations  sales and marketing channels and personnel 
the integration process is a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
the challenges involved in this integration include the following demonstrating to customers and suppliers that the acquisitions will not result in adverse changes in client service standards or business focus and addressing any perceived adverse changes in business focus 
we may have difficulty successfully integrating the acquired businesses  the domestic and foreign operations or the product lines  and as a result  we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
additionally  we cannot assure that our growth rate will equal the growth rates that have been experienced by us and the acquired companies  respectively  operating as separate companies in the past 
genomic solutions  our subsidiary acquired in october  has a history of losses and may not be able to regain or sustain profitability 
prior to our acquisition  genomic solutions incurred net losses of million for the six months ended june   million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as of june   genomic solutions had an accumulated deficit of million 
in september  genomic solutions instituted a restructuring plan designed to reduce its operating expenses 
in july  genomic solutions announced a further restructuring of its operations 
however  even with these restructurings  genomic solutions needs to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
genomic solutions revenue growth depends on many factors  many of which are beyond its control  including factors discussed in this risk factors section 
additionally  genomic solutions may not regain or sustain revenue growth  as evidenced during  due to difficulties in integrating its acquisitions of genemachines and biorobotics which resulted in a further restructuring in june even if genomic solutions does achieve profitability  it may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
as an acquisitive company  we may be the subject of lawsuits from either an acquired company s previous stockholders or our current stockholders 
as an acquisitive company  we may be the subject of lawsuits from either an acquired company s previous stockholders or our current stockholders 
these lawsuits could result from the actions of the acquisition target prior to the date of the acquisition  from the acquisition transaction itself or from actions after the acquisition 
defending potential lawsuits could cost us significant expense and detract management s attention from the operation of the business 
additionally  these lawsuits could result in the cancellation of or the inability to renew  certain insurance coverage that would be necessary to protect our assets 
accounting for goodwill may have a material adverse effect on us 
we have historically amortized goodwill resulting from our acquisitions on a straight line basis ranging from five to years 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from acquisitions after june  and existing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from acquisitions prior to july  that remain as of december  are no longer amortized  but instead are evaluated annually  or more frequently  if events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment  to determine whether any portion of the remaining balance of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
if it is determined in the future that a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives is impaired  we will be required to write off that portion of the asset according to the methods defined by sfas no 
which could have an adverse effect on net income for the period in which the write off occurs 
at december   we had goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of million  or of our total assets 
if our accounting estimates are not correct  our financial results could be adversely affected 
management judgment and estimates are necessarily required in the application of our critical accounting policies 
we discuss these estimates in the subsection entitled critical accounting policies beginning on page if our estimates are incorrect  our future financial operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our business is subject to economic  political and other risks associated with international revenues and operations 
since we manufacture and sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our revenues from our non us operations represented approximately of total revenues for we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues 
in addition  a number of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which resulted in a foreign currency gain of approximately  for and an increase in foreign equity of approximately million  for the year ended december   changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  including western europe and japan  in particular  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws affecting the ability to expatriate profits  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  and unfavorable labor regulations applicable to european operations  such as severance and the unenforceability of non competition agreements in the european union 
we may lose money when we exchange foreign currency received from international revenues into us dollars 
for the year ended december   approximately of our business was conducted in functional currencies other than the us dollar  which is our reporting currency 
as a result  currency fluctuations among the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
in the future  we may undertake to manage foreign currency risk through additional hedging methods 
we recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in managing foreign currency risk or in predicting the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
failure to complete all aspects of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting required by the sarbanes oxley act of may result in a decrease in our stock price 
in addition to our responsibilities with respect to an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures  we  under the supervision and with the participation of our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  are in the process of performing the assessments required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission collectively  the section requirements 
we are required to include a report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report on form k or form k a filed within forty five days after march  our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
while we have been and continue to devote significant resources to prepare for the section requirements  we cannot assure you that our management will be able to complete all aspects of its assessment by the filing deadline or that our independent auditor will be able to complete all aspects of the testing necessary to attest to management s assessment 
further  since testing of key controls is still in process we cannot assure you that  once completed  management s assessment and the auditor s attestation will not report any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in addition to those already identified 
additional costs for complying with recent changes in securities and exchange commission  nasdaq stock market and accounting rules could adversely affect our profits 
recent changes in the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq rules including the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as changes in accounting rules  will cause us to incur significant additional costs including professional fees  as well as additional personnel costs  in order to keep informed of the changes and operate in a compliant manner 
these additional costs which were approximately million during  may be significant enough to cause our growth targets to be reduced  and consequently  our financial position and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
we expect the cost of our sarbanes oxley compliance efforts to be approximately million during we plan significant growth  and there is a risk that we will not be able to manage this growth 
our success will depend on the expansion of our operations both through organic growth and acquisitions 
effective growth management will place increased demands on management  operational and financial resources and expertise 
to manage growth  we must expand our facilities  augment our operational  financial and management systems  and hire and train additional qualified personnel 
failure to manage this growth effectively could impair our ability to generate revenue or could cause our expenses to increase more rapidly than revenue  resulting in operating losses or reduced profitability as evidenced in our results 
if we fail to retain key personnel and hire  train and retain qualified employees  we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in reduced revenue or increased costs 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of key management  technical and scientific personnel 
our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time upon short notice 
the loss of the services of any member of the senior management team  including the chief executive officer  chane graziano  the president  david green  the chief operating officer  susan luscinski  the chief financial officer  bryce chicoyne or any of the managerial  technical or scientific staff may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of product development and other business objectives 
we maintain key person life insurance on messrs 
graziano and green 
our future success will also depend on our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the technology area is intense  and we operate in several geographic locations where labor markets are particularly competitive  including boston  massachusetts and london and cambridge  england  and where demand for personnel with these skills is extremely high and is likely to remain high 
as a result  competition for qualified personnel is intense  particularly in the areas of general management  finance  information technology  engineering and science  and the process of hiring suitably qualified personnel is often lengthy and expensive  and may become more expensive in the future 
if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced 
our competitors and potential competitors may develop products and technologies that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products 
we expect to encounter increased competition from both established and development stage companies that continually enter the market 
we anticipate that these competitors will include companies developing and marketing life sciences research tools  health care companies that manufacture laboratory based tests and analyzers  diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  analytical instrument companies and companies developing drug discovery technologies 
currently  our principal competition comes from established companies that provide products that perform many of the same functions for which we market our products 
our competitors may develop or market products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  operational  marketing and technical resources than we do 
moreover  these competitors may offer broader product lines and tactical discounts  and may have greater name recognition 
in addition  we may face competition from new entrants into the field 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
our products compete in markets that are subject to rapid technological change  and therefore one or more of our products could be made obsolete by new technologies 
because the market for drug discovery tools is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions  our product lines may be made obsolete unless we are able to continually improve existing products and develop new products 
to meet the evolving needs of its customers  we must continually enhance our current and planned products and develop and introduce new products 
however  we may experience difficulties that may delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements 
in addition  our product lines are based on complex technologies that are subject to rapid change as new technologies are developed and introduced in the marketplace 
we may have difficulty in keeping abreast of the rapid changes affecting each of the different markets we serve or intend to serve 
our failure to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing technology  market demands or the requirements of our customers could cause our product sales to decline  and we could experience significant losses 
we offer and plan to offer a broad product line and have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses for development of new products and enhanced versions of our existing products 
the speed of technological change in our market may prevent us from being able to successfully market some or all of our products for the length of time required to recover development costs 
failure to recover the development costs of one or more products or product lines could decrease our profitability or cause us to experience significant losses 
we entered into a million credit facility in november which contains certain financial and negative covenants the breach of which may adversely affect our financial condition 
we anticipate that our operations will support the covenants required as part of the million revolving credit facility with brown brothers harriman 
however  if we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants  in addition to other actions the creditor may require  the amounts drawn on the million facility may become immediately due and payable 
this immediate payment may negatively impact our financial condition and we may be forced by our creditor into actions which may not be in our best interests 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to implement our acquisition strategy  expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenue 
we anticipate that our financial resources which include available cash  cash generated from operations  and debt and equity capacity  will be sufficient to finance operations and capital expenditures for at least twelve months 
however  this expectation is premised on the current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors  including market acceptance of new products and future opportunities with collaborators 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise capital could seriously harm our business and product development and acquisition efforts 
if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt or equity linked securities  existing percentages of ownership in our common stock will be reduced 
in addition  these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock 
we may issue securities that have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements  we may relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products  or grant licenses to third parties on terms that are unfavorable 
we may be unable to raise additional funds on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  our credit facility with brown brothers harriman contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requires creditor approval for acquisitions funded with cash in excess of million and for those which may be funded with equity in excess of million 
currently  we are prohibited from accessing the public debt or equity markets until we are able to provide historical audited financial statements for a previous acquisition or until such financial statements are no longer required to be provided by sec regulations 
we are in the process of seeking to complete these audited financial statements and  once we complete these audited financial statements  we will be able to register our debt or equity securities using form s or other appropriate form of registration statement 
however  until this matter is resolved  our ability to raise capital may be limited to private equity transactions and or additional borrowing and may result in entering into an agreement on less than favorable terms 
if future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  we may have to curtail operations or change our business strategy 
if we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property  third parties may use our technology  which would impair our ability to compete in our markets 
our continued success will depend in significant part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for certain of our products throughout the world 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
we own us patents and have patent applications pending in the us we also own numerous us registered trademarks and trade names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending 
we rely on patents to protect a significant part of our intellectual property and to enhance our competitive position 
however  our presently pending or future patent applications may not issue as patents  and any patent previously issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
furthermore  the claims in patents which have been issued or which may be issued to us in the future may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar to our products 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology  our ability to be commercially competitive will be materially impaired 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we generally seek to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners upon the commencement of a relationship 
however  we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances 
in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information  these agreements  even if obtained  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information 
in addition  adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information 
the loss or exposure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents that would be expensive and time consuming 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties 
we may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions 
several of our products are based on patents that are closely surrounded by patents held by competitors or potential competitors 
as a result  we believe there is a greater likelihood of a patent dispute than would be expected if our patents were not closely surrounded by other patents 
the defense and prosecution  if necessary  of intellectual property suits  interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings would be costly and divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities 
we may not prevail in any of these suits 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
for example  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
securities analysts or investors may perceive these announcements to be negative  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others 
we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others  including the patent rights  trademarks and trade names of third parties 
intellectual property litigation is costly and the outcome is uncertain 
if we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity  or obtain a license to or design around the intellectual property in question 
if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms  or are unable to design around any third party patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products and services  which could result in reduced revenue 
we are dependent upon our licensed technologies and may need to obtain additional licenses in the future to offer our products and remain competitive 
we have licensed key components of our technologies from third parties 
while we do not currently derive a material portion of our revenue from products that depend on these licensed technologies  we may in the future 
if our license agreements were to terminate prematurely or if we breach the terms of any licenses or otherwise fail to maintain our rights to these technologies  we may lose the right to manufacture or sell our products that use these licensed technologies 
in addition  we may need to obtain licenses to additional technologies in the future in order to keep our products competitive 
if we fail to license or otherwise acquire necessary technologies  we may not be able to develop new products that we need to remain competitive 
many of our current and potential customers are from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and are subject to risks faced by those industries 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we expect that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies will continue to be one of our major sources of revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are subject to risks and uncertainties that affect the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  such as pricing pressures as third party payers continue challenging the pricing of medical products and services  government regulation  ongoing consolidation and uncertainty of technological change  and to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries 
in particular  several proposals are being contemplated by lawmakers in the united states to extend the federal medicare program to include reimbursement for prescription drugs 
many of these proposals involve negotiating decreases in prescription drug prices or imposing price controls on prescription drugs 
if appropriate reimbursement cannot be obtained  it could result in customers purchasing fewer products from us as they reduce their research and development expenditures 
in particular  the biotechnology industry has been faced with declining market capitalization and a difficult capital raising and financing environment 
if biotechnology companies are unable to obtain the financing necessary to purchase our products  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
as it relates to both the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  many companies have significant patents that have expired or are about to expire  which could result in reduced revenues for those companies 
if pharmaceutical companies suffer reduced revenues as a result of these patent expirations  they may be unable to purchase our products  and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we are dependent  both directly and indirectly  upon general health care spending patterns  particularly in the research and development budgets of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  as well as upon the financial condition and purchasing patterns of various governments and government agencies 
many of our customers  including universities  government research laboratories  private foundations and other institutions  obtain funding for the purchase of products from grants by governments or government agencies 
there exists the risk of a potential decrease in the level of governmental spending allocated to scientific and medical research which could substantially reduce or even eliminate these grants 
if government funding necessary to purchase our products were to decrease  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to achieve and sustain market acceptance of our target validation  high throughput screening  assay development and admet screening products across their broad intended range of applications  we will not generate expected revenue growth and profits could be adversely affected 
our business strategy depends  in part  on successfully developing and commercializing our admet screening  molecular biology  high throughput high content screening  and genomics  proteomics and high throughput screening to meet customers expanding needs and demands  an example of which is the copas and mias technologies obtained from the acquisition of union biometrica 
market acceptance of this and other new products will depend on many factors  including the extent of our marketing efforts and our ability to demonstrate to existing and potential customers that our technologies are superior to other technologies or techniques and products that are available now or may become available in the future 
if our new products do not gain market acceptance  or if market acceptance occurs at a slower rate than anticipated  it could materially adversely affect our business and future growth prospects and could result in a goodwill and or intangible impairment loss 
if ge healthcare formerly amersham biosciences terminates its distribution agreements with us or fails to perform its obligations under the distribution agreements  it could impair the marketing and distribution efforts for some of our products and result in lost revenues 
during  general electric acquired amersham plc  the parent of amersham biosciences 
in connection with the acquisition  amersham biosciences was renamed ge healthcare ge 
while ge has indicated its intention to continue amersham s presence in the life science market  and we believe our relationship with ge is good  we cannot guarantee that the distribution agreements will be renewed  that ge will aggressively market our products in the future or that ge will continue the partnership 
for  approximately of our revenues were generated through two distribution agreements with ge 
the first distribution agreement was renegotiated in august under this agreement  ge acts as the primary marketing and distribution channel for the majority of the products of our biochrom subsidiary and  as a result  we are restricted from allowing another person or entity to distribute  market and sell the majority of the products of our biochrom subsidiary into the life sciences market 
we are also restricted from making or promoting sales of the majority of the products of our biochrom subsidiary to any person or entity other than ge or its authorized sub distributors 
we have little or no control over ge s marketing and sales activities or the use of its resources 
ge may fail to purchase sufficient quantities of products from us or perform appropriate marketing and sales activities 
the failure by ge to perform these activities could materially adversely affect our business and growth prospects during the term of this agreement 
in addition  our inability to maintain our arrangement with ge for product distribution could materially impede the growth of our business and our ability to generate sufficient revenue 
our agreement with ge may be terminated with days notice under certain circumstances 
this agreement has an initial term of three years  commencing august   after which it will automatically renew for an additional two years  unless terminated earlier by either party 
in addition  the agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms by either party upon months prior written notice 
the second distribution agreement  between hoefer  inc  our subsidiary  and ge was entered into in november in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of the hoefer d gel electrophoresis business  including the hoefer name  from amersham bioscience 
the agreement provides that hoefer will be the exclusive supplier of d gel electrophoresis products to ge 
hoefer also has the right to develop  manufacture and market d gel electrophoresis products  which would be offered to ge for sale under the ge brand name 
hoefer has the right to sell any of its products  under the hoefer brand name or any other non ge brand name  through other distribution channels  both direct and indirect 
the initial term of the agreement is five years with an automatic five year renewal period 
ge may terminate the agreement during the renewal period if they decide to cease all activities in d gel electrophoresis or if hoefer fails to deliver new d gel electrophoresis products 
customer  vendor and employee uncertainty about the effects of any of our acquisitions could harm us 
we and the acquired companies customers may  in response to the consummation of the acquisitions  delay or defer purchasing decisions 
any delay or deferral in purchasing decisions by customers could adversely affect our business 
similarly  employees of acquired companies may experience uncertainty about their future role until or after we execute our strategies with regard to employees of acquired companies 
this may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing and technical personnel following an acquisition 
a significant portion of the sales cycle for our products is lengthy and we may spend significant time on sales opportunities with no assurance of success 
our ability to obtain customers for our products  specifically for products made by union biometrica and genomic solutions  depends in significant part upon the perception that our products can help accelerate drug discovery and development efforts 
the sales cycle for these systems is typically between three and six months due to the education effort that is required 
our sales efforts often require sales presentations to various departments within a single customer  including research and development personnel and key management 
in addition  we may be required to negotiate agreements containing terms unique to each customer 
we may expend substantial funds and management effort with no assurance that we will successfully sell our systems or products to the customer 
ethical concerns surrounding the use of our products and misunderstanding of the nature of our business could adversely affect our ability to develop and sell our existing products and new products 
genetic screening of humans is used to determine individual predisposition to medical conditions 
genetic screening has raised ethical issues regarding the confidentiality and appropriate uses of the resulting information 
government authorities may regulate or prohibit the use of genetic screening to determine genetic predispositions to medical conditions 
additionally  the public may disfavor and reject the use of genetic screening 
genomic and proteomic research is used to determine the role of genes and proteins in living organisms 
our products are designed and used for genomic and proteomic research and drug discovery and are generally not well suited for human screening 
however  it is possible that government authorities and the public may fail to distinguish between the genetic screening of humans and genomic and proteomic research 
if this occurs  our products and the processes for which our products are used may be subjected to government regulations intended to affect genetic screening 
further  if the public fails to distinguish between the two fields  it may pressure our customers to discontinue the research and development initiatives for which our products are used 
additionally  some of our products may be used in areas of research involving cloning  stem cell use  organ transplants  animal research and other techniques presently being explored in the drug discovery industry

public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
we also have a staggered board of directors that makes it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year

the merger with genomic solutions may fail to qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes  resulting in the recognition of taxable gain or loss in respect of our treatment of the merger as a taxable sale 
both we and genomic solutions intended the merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
although the internal revenue service  or irs  will not provide a ruling on the matter  genomic solutions obtained a legal opinion from its tax counsel that the merger constitutes a reorganization for federal income tax purposes 
this opinion does not bind the irs or prevent the irs from adopting a contrary position 
if the merger fails to qualify as a reorganization  the merger would be treated as a deemed taxable sale of assets by genomic solutions for an amount equal to the merger consideration received by genomic solutions stockholders plus any liabilities assumed by us 
as successor to genomic solutions  we would be liable for any tax incurred by genomic solutions as a result of this deemed asset sale

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manufacture and test the majority of products in research centers in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  belgium and austria 
we sell our products globally through our direct catalog sales  direct sales force and indirect distributor channels 
as a result  our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we collect amounts representing a substantial portion of our revenues and pay amounts representing a substantial portion of our operating expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect our operating results 
historically  we have not hedged our foreign currency position 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
however  as our sales expand internationally  we plan to evaluate currency risks and we may enter into foreign exchange contracts from time to time to mitigate foreign currency exposure
