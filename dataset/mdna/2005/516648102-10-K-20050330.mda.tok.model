our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained herein have been recast to reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of rsm technologies  inc as a discontinued operation 
we accounted for our rsm technologies  inc business as a separate legal entity and the following selected financial data for our discontinued operations is presented as such 
see also note to our consolidated financial statements 
selected financial data for discontinued operations year ended december  revenue gross profit loss operating expenses loss from discontinued operations effective november   we no longer include the results of operations and cash flows of our discontinued rsm technologies  inc business in our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we had  of cash on hand at december  reflecting a decrease of  when compared to the  of cash on hand at december  the cash on hand at december  was  the cash required by operations for was  which was attributable to our net loss for the year and cash used for discontinued operations  and was offset by increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets  accrued expenses to related parties  accounts payable and accrued expenses for discontinued operations  and a reserve for litigation  and decreases to inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses  and deferred income 
the cash required by continuing and discontinuing operations for and was  and  respectively  and was a result of our net loss and increase in inventory which was partially offset by non cash expenses for consulting  legal fees  settlements  and employee compensation 
the cash flows from investing activities was  for the year ended december  as compared to net cash requirements of  for the year ended december  reflecting an increase of  the net cash flow for capital expenditures in the current year was  mainly due to the reduction in machinery and equipment

index liquidity and capital resources continues to be an ongoing challenge 
as of this point in time  the company must fund its monthly continuing operations through the selling of additional shares of stock and or from the borrowing of funds from the chairman of the board 
as the company continues to increase their sales  streamline existing processes  increase their gross margins  and review on a monthly basis those sales  general  and administrative expenses needing to be trimmed down  the company should stop having to rely so heavily on the amount of funds needed to continue funding operations from outside and related parties 
however  at the current time  if adequate funds are not available when needed  our business  operations  financial condition and future prospects may be materially adversely affected 
although no formal commitment has been received from the chairman of the board to fund the company s operating requirements for the year  we have received for the period beginning as of january  through march   loans amounting to  out of those proceeds   was used for the purchase of lapolla industries  inc during the first quarter of all outstanding loan amounts from the chairman of the board are bearing interest at per annum 
furthermore  the company will be actively seeking to raise cash proceeds of at least  privately  on a best efforts basis  pursuant to a private placement offering  however  there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent on management s successful execution of its business plan
