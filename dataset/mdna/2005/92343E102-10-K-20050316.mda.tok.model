overview verisign  inc is a leading provider of intelligent infrastructure services that enable people and businesses to find  connect  secure  and transact across complex global networks 
in  our business consisted of two reportable segments the internet services group and the communications services group 
prior to  our business included an additional reportable segment  the network solutions domain name registrar business  which was sold in november improving economic conditions during in the us  europe and japan led to improved customer spending in each of our principal business segments leading to growth in revenues and deferred revenues 
it spending for security services and e commerce activity in our principal geographic markets accelerated as the year progressed and we saw continued growth in domain name registrations and domain name renewals  with active domain names ending in 
com and 
net increasing by during spending for our services by telecommunications customers in the united states also increased during the year  and jamba  our european based provider of mobile content services to telecommunications carriers and customers that was acquired in june  contributed approximately million of revenues during in the us  the communications services group s results were adversely affected as the pace of consolidations in the domestic telecommunications sector quickened during the year 
we derive the majority of our revenues and cash flows from a relatively small number of products and services sold primarily in the united states  europe and japan 
in the internet services group  more than of the revenues during were derived from the sale of web certificates  payment services  managed authentication and security services and registry services 
in the communications services group  of the revenues were derived from the sale of calling name services  billing services  ss connectivity  signaling services  and mobile content services during the same period 
for the communications services group  we expect growth in mobile content services revenues  particularly in new markets such as the us  offset somewhat by a decline in connectivity  clearing and settlement  and billing related revenues in the first quarter with a return to moderate growth in such revenues expected in the second quarter 
consolidations in the telecommunications sector and pricing pressures have the potential to adversely impact the communications services group s results 
for the internet services group  we expect continued growth in the levels of it spending for security services by our customers in the us  europe and japan and growth in global e commerce activity that we believe will result in revenue and deferred revenue growth for

table of contents subsequent events on january   we announced that we had executed a definitive agreement to acquire lightsurf technologies  inc lightsurf 
under the terms of the agreement  we agreed to issue shares of our common stock having a value of approximately million for all of the outstanding capital stock  warrants and vested options of lightsurf and to pay certain transaction related expenses of lightsurf 
in addition  we will assume all unvested stock options of lightsurf 
lightsurf is a leading privately held provider of multimedia messaging and interoperability solutions for the wireless market 
the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions  including the issuance of a permit from the california department of corporations 
the transaction is anticipated to close by the end of the first quarter of in the first quarter of  we completed a settlement of litigation with a telecommunications carrier  resolving disputes over certain tariff charges for ss traffic that we passed through to telecommunications carriers who purchased our ss services 
under the settlement  the carrier refunded and or credited certain amounts to us and we refunded and or credited certain amounts to our customers 
as a result of the settlement  we will record a reduction in cost of revenues of approximately million in the first quarter of critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  long lived assets  restructuring  royalty liabilities  and deferred taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to the products and services to be provided 
our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events 
revenues from our consulting services are recognized using either the percentage of completion method or on a time and materials basis as work is performed 
percentage of completion is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project 
we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects 
if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made  then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed 
revenues from time and materials are recognized as services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an 
table of contents allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above 
in addition  we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category 
we also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration to any one customer  industry or geographic region 
we require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable  or approximately million 
a change of in our estimate would amount to approximately million 
valuation of long lived intangible assets including goodwill our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment 
we review  at least annually  goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review long lived assets  including certain identifiable intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 
recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled approximately million at december   which was comprised of million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
other intangible assets include customer relationships  technology in place  carrier relationships  non compete agreements  trade names  and customer lists 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired  an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations  of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
it is our policy to engage third party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our long lived intangible assets including goodwill 

table of contents restructuring and other charges in november  we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our network solutions business and the realignment of other business units 
in april  we initiated plans to restructure our operations to fully rationalize  integrate and align our resources 
both plans resulted in reductions in workforce  abandonment of excess facilities  disposal of property and equipment and other charges 
we expect these restructuring plans to be completed in upon the expiration of our lease obligations for abandoned facilities 
restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space  including the potential for sublease income 
estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented  the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property 
these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located  such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates 
changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis  as necessary 
during  we recorded net restructuring reversals of approximately million related to excess facilities as a result of reductions in lease obligations 
such estimates will likely be revised in the future 
if sublease rates continue to change in these markets  or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  the actual lease expense could exceed this estimate by an additional million over the next ten years relating to our restructuring plans 
provision for royalty liabilities for intellectual property rights certain of our mobile content services utilize intellectual property owned or held under license by others 
where we have not yet entered into a license agreement with a holder  we record a provision for royalty payments that we estimate will be due once a license agreement is concluded 
we estimate the royalty payments based on the prevailing royalty rate for the type of intellectual property being utilized 
our estimates could differ materially from the actual royalties to be paid under any definitive license agreements that may be reached due to changes in the market for such intellectual property  such as a change in demand for a particular type of content  in which case we would record a royalty expense materially different than our estimate 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance is required to be applied to certain deferred tax assets  we considered such factors as our history of operating losses  our uncertainty as to the projected long term operating results  and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
although our operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods  our evaluation of all of the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets indicated that such plans were not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative evidence 
the possible future reversal of the valuation allowance will result in future income statement benefit to the extent the valuation allowance was applied to deferred tax assets generated through ongoing operations 
to the extent the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets generated through stock compensation deductions  the possible future reversal of such valuation allowance will result in a credit to additional paid in capital and will not result in future income statement benefit

our effective tax rates differ from the united states federal statutory rate of primarily due to state taxes  acquisition related expenses  the realization of domestic net operating loss  capital loss  and research credit carryforwards  and the impact of foreign operations 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is based on several factors  including the company s past earnings and the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities 
management does not believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets relating to us federal and state operations are realizable 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be increased in the near future if the company exhibits sufficient positive evidence in future periods that demonstrate the continuation of its trend in projected earnings is achievable 
if the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets were released as of december   approximately million would be credited to the statement of operations  million would be credited to additional paid in capital  and million would be credited to goodwill 
management would continue to apply a valuation allowance of million to the deferred tax asset for capital loss carryforwards  and million to the deferred tax asset relating to the write down of investments  due to the limited carryover life of such tax attributes 
management does not believe it is more likely than not that million of deferred tax assets relating to certain foreign operations are realizable  therefore  a valuation allowance is applied to the deferred tax asset 
on the remaining foreign operations  management believes it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized  accordingly  a valuation allowance was not applied on these assets

we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and operating cash flows  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
acquisitions or investments to be funded with cash may require us to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
this additional funding  if needed  might not be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could materially harm our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of our stock owned by our then current stockholders will be reduced

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk equity investments we invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for investment purposes 
in most instances  we invest in the equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market  and therefore  carry a high level of risk 
these companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the near term 
therefore  these companies may never become publicly traded 
even if they do  an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments 
in  and  we determined the decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized net impairment losses totaling million  million  and million  respectively 
due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments  and in light of current stock market conditions  we may incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our cash management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and driving after tax returns 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to interest rate risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to minimize interest rate risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate bonds and notes  us government and agency securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   of our cash investments mature in less than one year 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk 
maturing in total estimated fair value six months or less six months to one year more than one year dollars in thousands included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in restricted cash weighted average interest rate foreign exchange risk management we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies 
as we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a foreign currency risk management program designed to mitigate foreign exchange 
table of contents risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies 
the primary objective of this hedging program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates 
the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than months 
at december   we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies 
all hedge contracts are recorded at fair market value 
we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with high quality financial institutions
