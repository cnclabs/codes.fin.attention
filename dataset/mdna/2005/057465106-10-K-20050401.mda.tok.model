item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 
during a clearance sale  we instruct our stores systematically to lower the price of the items  and if not sold  to ship them to to of our stores which have special clearance sections 
we believe that our test and react strategy and our careful monitoring of inventories and consumer buying trends help us to reduce sales at clearance prices 
stores store locations and environment 
our stores are designed to attract customers who are intrigued by a young and contemporary lifestyle and to create an inviting  exciting atmosphere in which it is fun for them to shop in locations where they want to shop 
our stores average approximately  square feet and are primarily located in regional shopping malls 
seven of our stores  which are located in dense urban markets such as new york city and chicago  have freestanding street locations 
our stores are designed to create a clean  upscale boutique environment  featuring contemporary finishings and sophisticated details 
glass exteriors allow passersby to see easily into the store from the high visibility  high traffic locations in the malls where we have located most of our stores 
the open floor design allows customers to readily view the majority of the merchandise on display while store fixtures allow for the efficient display of accessories

various fashion themes are displayed throughout the store utilizing combinations of styles and colors 
store concepts 
we operate our stores under two different concepts  bakers and wild pair 
as of january   of our stores were bakers stores and stores were wild pair stores 
as of march   we operated stores  of which were bakers stores and of which were wild pair stores 
bakers our bakers stores focus on widely accepted  mainstream fashion and provide a fun  high energy shopping environment geared toward young women between the ages of and wild pair our wild pair stores feature fashion forward merchandise for hip young women and men between the ages of and and are becoming recognized for reflecting the attitude and lifestyle of this demographic niche 
the wild pair customer demands edgier  faster fashion that exists further towards the leading edge than does the typical bakers customer  which allows us to better monitor the direction of the fashion forward look that our bakers customer will be seeking 
to match the attitude of our wild pair merchandise  we have created a club atmosphere and a fast  fun environment within our wild pair stores 
wild pair stores carry a higher proportion of branded merchandise  which generally sells at higher price points than our bakers footwear

our stores can operate profitably in a wide range of mall classifications 
we principally open our new stores in malls that are considered a and b locations 
however  some of our stores are located in malls that are less attractive and do not warrant the investment required to fully remodel a store at its lease renewal 
however  we will continue to operate these stores as long as they meet profitability requirements 
in addition  these stores are valuable in maintaining strong relationships with our national landlords 
many of these stores are larger in size than our newly designed stores  but have significantly lower per square foot occupancy costs 
we expect new stores to average approximately  per year in store volume and contribute approximately  of cash flow from operating activities per year 
our typical cash outlay to open a new store is approximately  we closed stores in fiscal year  stores in fiscal year and stores in fiscal we closed an additional four stores in fiscal year through march  store operations 
our store operations are organized into three divisions  east  central and west  which are subdivided into regions 
each region is managed by a regional manager  who is typically responsible for to stores 
each store is typically staffed with a manager and an assistant manager  in addition to approximately five sales associates 
in some markets where stores are more closely located  one of the store managers may also act as an area manager for the stores in that area  assisting the regional manager for those stores 
our regional managers are primarily responsible for the operation and results of the stores in their region  including the hiring or promotion of store managers 
we develop new store managers by promoting from within and selectively hiring from other retail organizations 
our store managers are primarily responsible for sales results  customer service training  hiring of store level staff  payroll control and shortage control 
merchandise selections  inventory management and visual merchandising strategies for each store are largely determined at the corporate level and are communicated by email to the stores generally on a weekly basis 
our commitment to customer satisfaction and service is an integral part of building customer loyalty 
we seek to instill enthusiasm and dedication in our store management personnel and sales associates through incentive programs and regular communication with the stores 
sales associates receive commissions on sales with a guaranteed minimum hourly compensation 
from time to time  we run sales contests to encourage our sales associates to maximize sales volume 
store managers receive base compensation plus incentive compensation based on sales and inventory control 
regional and area managers receive base compensation plus incentive compensation based on meeting profitability benchmarks 
each of our managers controls the payroll hours used each week in conjunction with a budget provided by the regional manager 

table of contents we have well established store operating policies and procedures and use an in store training regimen for all new store employees 
on a regular basis  our merchandising staff provides the stores with merchandise presentation instructions  which include diagrams and photographs of fixture presentations 
in addition  our internal newsletter provides product descriptions  sales histories and other milestone information to sales associates to enable them to gain familiarity with our product offerings and our business 
we offer our sales associates a discount on our merchandise to encourage them to wear our merchandise and to reflect our lifestyle image both on and off the selling floor 
our regional managers are responsible for maintaining a loss prevention program in each of our stores 
our loss prevention efforts include monitoring returns  voided transactions  employee sales and deposits  as well as educating our store personnel on loss prevention 
we monitor inventory through electronic receipt acknowledgment to better monitor loss prevention factors  which allows us to identify variances and further to reduce our losses due to damage  theft or other reasons 
since these systems were implemented  our shrinkage has dropped significantly 
in addition to these internal control measures  we commission an independent loss prevention audit twice per year 
sourcing and distribution we source each of our private label product lines separately based on the individual design  styling and quality specifications of those products 
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and rely primarily on third party foreign manufacturers in china  brazil  italy  spain  and other countries for the production of our private label merchandise 
we believe that this sourcing of footwear products and our short lead times minimize our working capital investment and inventory risk  and enable efficient and timely introduction of new product designs 
although we have not entered into any long term manufacturing or supply contracts  we believe that a sufficient number of alternative sources exist for the manufacture of our products 
the principal materials used in the manufacture of our footwear and accessory merchandise are available from any number of domestic or international sources 
management  or its agents  performs an array of quality control inspection procedures at stages in the production process  including examination and testing of prototypes of key products prior to manufacture  samples and materials prior to production  and final products prior to shipment 
through substantially all merchandise for our stores was initially received  inspected  processed and distributed through one of our two distribution centers  each of which is part of a third party warehousing system 
in  we implemented new procedures in which we are shipping a substantial amount of products sourced from china directly to our stores through los angeles  california  rather than shipping them first to our west coast distribution center in los angeles 
the remaining merchandise that is manufactured in asia is delivered to our west coast distribution center and merchandise that is manufactured elsewhere in the world is delivered to our east coast distribution center located near philadelphia  pennsylvania 
in accordance with our micro merchandising strategy  our allocation teams determine how the product should be distributed among the stores based on current inventory levels  sales trends  specific product characteristics and the buyers input 
merchandise typically is shipped to the stores as soon as possible after receipt in our distribution center using third party carriers  and any goods not shipped to stores are stored in warehouse space in st 
louis  missouri for replenishment purposes 
information systems and technology our information systems integrate our individual stores  merchandising  distribution and financial systems 
daily sales and cash deposit information is electronically collected from the stores point of sale terminals nightly 
this allows management to make timely decisions in response to market conditions 
these 
table of contents include decisions about pricing  markdowns  reorders and inventory management 
our customers use cash  checks and third party credit cards to purchase our products 
we do not issue private credit cards or make use of complicated financing arrangements 
recently  our focus is the further integration of our planning  purchasing and point of sale systems 
we have recently completed the transition to a new point of sale system and implemented arthur allocation and marketmax assortment planning 
these new systems allow us to better execute our micro merchandising strategy through more efficient management and allocation of our store inventories to reduce further our response times in reaction to fashion trends 
in addition  these systems also allow us to identify and reduce our losses due to damage  theft or other reasons  and to improve monitoring of employee productivity 
marketing through in store advertising our marketing consists primarily of an in store  high impact  visual advertising campaign 
marketing materials are particularly positioned to exploit our high visibility  high traffic mall locations 
banners in our windows and signage on our walls and tables may highlight a particular fashion story  a seasonal theme or a featured piece of merchandise 
we utilize promotional giveaways or promotional event marketing 
to cultivate brand loyalty  we successfully introduced our bakers frequent buying card program nationwide in late this program allows our customers to purchase a plastic  bar coded card bearing our logo in order to obtain a discount on all future purchases in our stores until the expiration of the card 
we believe that this program has improved customer loyalty 
competition we believe that our bakers stores have no direct national competitors who specialize in full service  moderate priced fashion footwear for young women 
yet  the footwear and accessories retail industry is highly competitive and characterized by low barriers to entry 
competitive factors in our industry include brand name recognition  product styling  product quality  product presentation  product pricing  store ambiance  customer service  and convenience 
we believe that we match or surpass our competitors on the competitive factors that matter most to our target customer 
we offer the convenience of being located in high traffic  high visibility locations within the shopping malls in which our customer prefers to shop 
we have a focused strategy on our target customer that offers her the fun store atmosphere  full service and style that she desires 
several types of competitors vie for our target customer department stores such as bloomingdale s  dillard s  macy s and may department stores  national branded wholesalers such as candie s  nine west  steve madden and vans  national branded off price retailers such as dsw  rack room and shoe carnival  national specialty retailers such as finish line  journey s  naturalizer and aldo s  regional chains such as cathy jean and sheik  
table of contents discount stores such as wal mart  target and k mart  and  to a lesser extent  apparel retailers such as bebe  charlotte russe  express  rampage and wet seal 
department stores generally are not located within the interior of the mall where our target customer prefers to shop with her friends 
national branded wholesalers generally have a narrower line of footwear with higher average price points and target a more narrowly focused customer 
specialty retailers also cater to a different demographic than our target customer 
regional chains generally do not offer the depth of private label merchandise that we offer 
national branded off price retailers and discount stores do not provide the same level of fashion or customer service 
apparel retailers  if they sell shoes or accessories  generally offer a narrow line of styles  which can encourage a customer to come to our store to purchase shoes or accessories to complement her new outfit 
our competitors sell a broad assortment of footwear and accessories that are similar and sometimes identical to those we sell  and at times may be able to provide comparable merchandise at lower prices 
while each of these different distribution channels may be able to compete with us on fashion  value or service  we believe that none of them can successfully match or surpass us on all three of these elements 
our wild pair stores compete on most of the same factors as bakers 
however  due to wild pair s market position  it is subject to more intense competition from national specialty retailers and national branded wholesalers 
history of bakers shoe stores under edison brothers  the first bakers shoe store opened in atlanta  georgia  in bakers grew to be one of the nation s largest women s moderately priced specialty fashion footwear retailers 
at its peak in  bakers had grown to approximately stores 
at that time  it was one of several footwear  apparel and entertainment retail specialty chains that were owned and operated by edison brothers  which in had over  stores in the united states  puerto rico  the virgin islands  mexico and canada 
edison brothers filed a petition for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code on november  after an unsuccessful reorganization  edison brothers refiled for bankruptcy on march   and immediately commenced a liquidation of all its assets 
in june  we purchased selected assets of the bakers and wild pair chains  approximately store locations  from edison brothers stores  inc  the debtor in possession 
employees as of january   we employed approximately full time and  part time employees 
as of january   we employed approximately of our employees in general administrative functions at our corporate offices and warehouse  and  employees at our store locations 
the number of part time employees fluctuates depending on our seasonal needs 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union  and we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
properties all of our stores are located in the united states 
we lease all of our store locations 
most of our leases have an initial term of at least ten years 
a number of our leases provide a lease termination option in specified years of the lease if we do not meet certain sales levels 
in addition  leases for locations typically require us to pay property taxes  utilities  repairs  maintenance  common area maintenance and  in some instances  merchant association fees 
some of our leases also require contingent rent based on sales 
we lease approximately  square feet for our headquarters  located at scott avenue  st 
louis  missouri the lease has approximately seven years remaining 
we also lease a warehouse in st 
louis that occupies approximately  square feet with a lease term of approximately five years 

table of contents intellectual property and proprietary rights we acquired the right and title to several trademarks in connection with the bakers acquisition  including our trademarks bakers tm and wild pair 
in addition  we currently have several applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office for additional registrations

our failure to identify and respond to changing consumer fashion preferences in a timely manner would negatively impact our sales  profitability and our image as a fashion resource for our customers 
the footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer fashion preferences 
our sales and net income are sensitive to these changing preferences  which can be rapid and dramatic 
accordingly  we must identify and interpret fashion trends and respond in a timely manner 
we continually market new styles of footwear  but demand for and market acceptance of these new styles are uncertain 
our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer fashion preferences may result in lower sales  higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories and lower gross profits 
conversely  if we fail to anticipate consumer demand for our products  we may experience inventory shortages  which would result in lost sales and could negatively impact our customer goodwill  our brand image and our profitability 
moreover  our business relies on continuous changes in fashion preferences 
stagnating consumer preferences could also result in lower sales and would require us to take higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories 
for example  in fiscal year  the nine months ended october  and the thirteen weeks ended october   changes in consumer 
table of contents fashion trends  primarily a decline in demand for boots and booties and a preference for low priced flip flops  negatively impacted sales and profitability 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of our recent restatement of financial statements  we may be subject to liability under the securities laws 
on march   we filed an amended annual report on form k a and amended quarterly reports on form q a to reflect a restatement of our previously issued financial statements to correct our accounting for landlord allowances and the commencement of lease terms 
we may be subject to liability under federal or state securities laws relating to our previously filed financial statements  other public disclosures of financial information based on those statements and our public disclosures relating to the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures 
public disclosure relating to some or all of these items were included in our registration statements and periodic reports filed with the sec 
we could be subject to claims by the purchasers in our initial public offering  purchasers under our resale registration statement and to others relating to transactions in our securities 
any such liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and on any investment in our securities 
there is relatively limited trading in our common stock 
prior to our initial public offering  there was no public market for our common stock 
the trading volume of our common stock since our initial public offering has been relatively limited  which we expect to continue 
therefore  our stock may be subject to higher volatility or illiquidity than would exist if our shares were traded more actively 
a decline in general economic conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our footwear and accessories and could lead to reduced sales and a delay in our expansion plans 
in addition to consumer fashion preferences  consumer spending habits are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
a general slowdown in the united states economy or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits  which would likely cause us to delay or slow our expansion plans and result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
we are susceptible to operating losses which would adversely affect our business and an investment in our common stock 
from time to time  we have had and in the future we could have operating losses because of fashion preferences  general economic conditions and other factors 
for example  for the nine months ended october   we incurred a net loss of approximately million and an operating loss of million 
we have also incurred losses in other recent periods 
such losses in future periods could adversely affect our business and an investment in our common stock 
our failure to integrate a significant number of new stores could strain our resources and cause the performance of our existing stores to suffer 
our growth will largely depend on our ability to open and operate new stores successfully 
we opened new stores in fiscal year if the private placement were not to close  we would expect to open an additional to additional new stores in fiscal year in new and existing markets 
we expect the net proceeds of the private placement to allow us to open an additional stores in the fall of and to target the opening of new stores in fiscal  substantially all in the new format 
the successful integration of these new stores and customer acceptance of our new store format may have a material effect on our business 
although we have successfully integrated a significant number of new stores in the past  including the former sam libby stores  that growth primarily related to acquisitions 
we expect a large portion of our future growth to occur through the development of new stores 
our proposed expansion will place increased demands 
table of contents on our operational  managerial and administrative resources 
these increased demands could cause us to operate our business less effectively  which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our business 
if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy  the opening of new stores  in new or current markets  could be delayed or prevented  could cost more than we have anticipated and could divert resources from other areas of our business  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and earnings growth 
our sales and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis  leaving our annual and quarterly operating results particularly susceptible to changes in customer shopping patterns 
to prepare for peak shopping seasons  we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry during other times of the year 
any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during these peak seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown  which could reduce our net sales and gross margins and could negatively impact our profitability 
traditionally  our sales and net income during the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year are significantly higher due primarily to increased shopping during the spring summer prom and wedding season and the winter holiday season 
in contrast  our sales and net income are typically lower during the first quarter of our fiscal year due  in part  to the traditional retail slowdown immediately following the winter holiday season and during our third quarter because we have two of our five clearance sales during the third quarter 
in addition to our normal seasonal fluctuations  some events  in particular the easter holiday  shift between fiscal quarters due to the nature of our fiscal year 
this shift will likely affect customer shopping patterns and will influence our quarterly comparable results 
fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations could cause the price of our common stock to decline substantially 
in addition to holiday shifts and customer shopping patterns  our quarterly results are affected by a variety of other factors  including fashion trends  the effectiveness of our inventory management  changes in our merchandise mix  weather conditions  changes in general economic conditions  and actions of competitors  mall anchor stores or co tenants 
due to factors such as these  our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
for example  quarterly comparable store sales for fiscal year compared to fiscal year were an increase of in the first quarter  an increase of in the second quarter  a decline of in the third quarter and a decline of in the fourth quarter 
while in management s opinion sales during these periods cannot be used as an accurate indicator of annual results  if our future quarterly results fail to meet the expectations of research analysts  then the market price of our common stock could decline substantially 
for more information  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 
our market share may be adversely impacted at any time by a significant number of competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by low barriers to entry 
we compete against a diverse group of competitors  including national branded wholesalers  national specialty retailers  regional chains  national branded off price retailers  traditional department stores  discounters and apparel 
table of contents retailers 
many of our competitors may be larger and have substantially greater resources than we do 
our market share and results of operations are adversely impacted by this significant number of competitors 
for more information about our competition  please see business competition 
the departure of members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business 
the success of our business depends upon our senior management closely supervising all aspects of our business  in particular the operation of our stores and the design  procurement and allocation of our merchandise 
retention of senior management is especially important in our business due to the limited availability of experienced and talented retail executives 
if we were to lose the services of peter edison  our chairman and chief executive officer  or michele bergerac  our president  or other members of our senior management  our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to employ a suitable replacement in a timely manner 
our failure to maintain good relationships with our manufacturers could harm our ability to procure quality inventory in a timely manner 
our ability to obtain attractive pricing  quick response  ordering flexibility and other terms from our manufacturers depends on their perception of us and our buying agents 
we do not own any production facilities or have any long term contracts with any manufacturers  and we typically order our inventory through purchase orders 
because of our relatively short lead times and fast inventory turns  any disruption in our supply chain could more quickly impact our sales compared to other retailers 
our failure or the failure of our buying agents to maintain good relationships with these manufacturers could increase our exposure to changing fashion cycles  which may lead to increased inventory markdown rates 
it is possible that we could be unable to acquire sufficient quantities or an appropriate mix of merchandise or raw materials at acceptable prices 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards 
in this event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
we are also subject to risks related to the availability and use of materials and manufacturing processes for our products  including those which some may find objectionable 
we rely on a small number of buying agents for our merchandise purchases  and our failure to maintain good relationships with any of them could harm our ability to source our products 
for fiscal year  our top five buying agents accounted for approximately of our merchandise purchases  with one buying agent accounting for approximately of our merchandise purchases 
our buying agents assist in developing our private label merchandise  arrange for the purchase of necessary materials and contract with manufacturers 
we execute nonexclusive agreements with some of our buying agents 
these agreements prohibit our buying agents from sharing commissions with manufacturers  owning stock or holding any ownership interest in  or being owned in any way by  any of our manufacturers or suppliers 
the agreements do not prohibit our buying agents from acting as agents for other purchasers  which could negatively impact our sales 
if they were to disclose our plans or designs to our competitors  our sales may be materially adversely impacted 
the loss of any of these key buying agents or a breach by them of our buying agent agreements could adversely affect our ability to develop or obtain merchandise 
our merchandise is manufactured by foreign manufacturers  therefore  the availability and costs of our products may be negatively affected by risks associated with international trade 
although all of our stores are located in the united states  virtually all of our merchandise is produced in china  brazil  italy  spain and other foreign countries 
therefore  we are subject to the risks associated with international trade  which include adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in import tariffs  duties or quotas  
table of contents the imposition of taxes or other charges on imports  the imposition of restrictive trade policies or sanctions by the united states on one or more of the countries from which we obtain footwear and accessories  expropriation or nationalization  compliance with and changes in import restrictions and regulations  exposure to different legal standards and the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and changing foreign government policies  international hostilities  war or terrorism  changes in foreign governments  regulations  political unrest  work stoppages  shipment disruption or delays  and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our manufacturers and suppliers are located 
for example  in fiscal year the west coast longshoremen s strike increased our freight costs and adversely affected our sales and operating margin for that fiscal year 
in addition  our imported products are subject to united states customs duties  which make up a material portion of the cost of the merchandise 
if customs duties are substantially increased  it would harm our profitability 
the united states and the countries in which our products are produced may impose new quotas  duties  tariffs  or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty  or tariff levels  any of which could have a harmful effect on our profitability 
furthermore  when declaring the duties owed on and the classifications of our imported products  we make various good faith assumptions 
we regularly employ a third party to review our customs declarations  and we will notify the appropriate authorities if any erroneous declarations are revealed 
however  the customs authorities retain the right to audit our declarations  which could result in additional tariffs  duties and or penalties if the authorities believe that they have discovered any errors 
our reliance on manufacturers in china exposes us to supply risks 
manufacturing facilities in china produce a significant portion of our products 
generally  approximately two thirds  or more  of our private label footwear units are manufactured in china and virtually all of our private label accessories are manufactured in china each year 
recently  the continued significant growth in the chinese economy has resulted in periodic energy and labor shortages  as well as transportation and shipping bottlenecks 
in addition  due to the overall volume of chinese imports  there have been delays at ports on the west coast of the united states 
these matters  changes in the chinese government or economy  or the current tariff or duty structures or adoption by the united states of trade polices or sanctions adverse to china  could harm our ability to obtain inventory in a timely and cost effective manner 
our ability to expand into some territorial and foreign jurisdictions under the trademarks bakers and wild pair is restricted 
when we acquired selected assets of the bakers and wild pair chains from edison brothers stores  inc in a bankruptcy auction in june  we were assigned title to and the right to use the trademarks bakers  the wild pair  wild pair and other trademarks to the extent owned by edison brothers at that time 
our rights to use the trademarks are subject to a concurrent use agreement which recognizes the geographical division of the trademarks between us and a puerto rican company 
at approximately the same time as we acquired our rights and title  edison brothers also assigned to the puerto rican company title to and the right to use the trademarks  subject to the concurrent use agreement 
under the concurrent use agreement  we and the puerto rican company agree that the puerto rican company has the exclusive right to use the trademarks in the commonwealth of puerto rico  the us virgin islands  central and south america  cuba  the dominican republic  the bahamas  the lesser antilles and jamaica and that we have the exclusive right to use the trademarks in the united states and throughout the world  except for the territories and 
table of contents jurisdictions in which the puerto rican company was assigned the rights 
consequently  we do not have the right to use the trademarks bakers and wild pair in those territories and foreign jurisdictions in which the puerto rican company owns the trademark rights  which may limit our growth 
our potential inability or failure to renew  register or otherwise protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names 
because the trademarks assigned to us by edison brothers are subject to the concurrent use agreement  the us trademark applications and registrations are jointly owned by us and a puerto rican company  which could impair our ability to renew and enforce the assigned applications and registrations 
simultaneously with the puerto rican company  we have filed separate concurrent use applications for the bakers and wild pair trademarks  and we have requested that existing applications for the trademark bakers also be divided territorially 
while we are in agreement with the puerto rican company that confusion is not likely to result from concurrent use of the trademarks in our respective territories  the united states patent and trademark office may not agree with our position 
if we are not able to register or renew our trademark registrations  our ability to prevent others from using trademarks and to capitalize on the value of our brand names may be impaired 
further  our rights in the trademarks could be subject to security interests granted by the puerto rican company 
our potential inability or failure to renew  register or otherwise protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights could negatively impact the value of our brand names 
we rely on third parties to manage the shipping  warehousing and distribution aspects of our business 
if these third parties do not adequately perform these functions  our business would be disrupted 
the efficient operation of our stores is dependent on our ability to distribute merchandise manufactured overseas to locations throughout the united states in a timely manner 
we depend on third parties to ship  receive and distribute substantially all of our merchandise 
a third party operating in china manages the shipping of merchandise from china either to a third party operating our los angeles  california distribution center or for delivery directly to our stores through los angeles 
the third party in los angeles  california accepts delivery of a significant portion of our merchandise from asia  and another third party near philadelphia  pennsylvania accepts delivery of our merchandise from elsewhere 
merchandise not shipped to our stores generally is shipped to our replenishment warehouse in sikeston  missouri  where a third party provides warehousing services or to our company operated warehouse in st 
louis  missouri 
these parties located in the united states have provided these services to us pursuant to written agreements since and one of these agreements is terminable upon days notice 
we anticipate the termination of the agreement relating to our sikeston  missouri warehouse and shifting those operations to our st 
louis facility in the spring of we also continue to operate under the terms of an expired agreement with the remaining third party 
if we need to replace one of these service providers  our operations could be disrupted for more than days while we identify and integrate a replacement into our system 
as a result  the termination of these agreements or the failure by any of these third parties to respond adequately to our warehousing and distribution needs could materially negatively impact our ability to maintain sufficient inventory in our stores and consequently our profitability 
we are subject to risks associated with leasing our stores  especially those stores where we acquired the lease through bankruptcy auctions 
we lease virtually all of our store locations under individual leases 
approximately one half of our stores are located in properties managed by two national property management companies 
we acquired most of our leases from edison brothers  as debtor in possession  or from other bankrupt entities through auctions in which a bankruptcy court ordered the assignment of the debtor s interest in the leases to us 
as a result  we have not separately negotiated a majority of our leases  which are generally drafted in favor of the landlord 
in addition  many of these leases contain provisions that  while applicable to the business structure of edison brothers  which had multiple wholly owned subsidiaries that were the tenants under the leases  would not have been necessary for our business structure 

table of contents a number of our leases include termination and default provisions which apply if we do not meet certain sales levels or in other circumstances 
in addition  some of these leases contain various restrictions relating to dilutions in  or changes of  the ownership of our company 
some of these provisions are difficult to interpret 
a substantial portion of our leases contain provisions which by their terms prohibit  or could be interpreted to prohibit  a dilution in  or change in ownership of our company  which may have been contravened by our initial public offering and other prior or subsequent ownership changes  including the private placement 
prior to our initial public offering  as of january   approximately of our leases contained provisions which by their terms prohibit a dilution in  or a change of  the ownership of our company which may have been contravened by our initial public offering and other prior or subsequent ownership changes 
as of that same date  similar provisions in an additional of our leases may be construed  depending on how these provisions are interpreted  to have been triggered by our initial public offering and other prior or subsequent ownership changes 
in addition  our leases subject us to risks relating to compliance with changing mall rules and the exercise of discretion by our landlords on various matters 
moreover  each year approximately to of our leases are subject to renewal or termination 
if one or more of our landlords decides to terminate our leases  or to not allow us to renew  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
our credit facility restricts our activities 
we have a million secured revolving credit facility with fleet retail group  inc as of january   we had no outstanding balance under our credit facility and had approximately million in availability 
for fiscal year  the largest outstanding balance under our credit facility was million prior to our initial public offering and million after our initial public offering 
for fiscal year  the average daily outstanding balance was million 
our credit facility includes financial and other customary covenants which  among other things  restrict our business activities and our ability to incur debt  make acquisitions and pay dividends 
a change in control of our company  including any person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or our combined voting power as defined in the credit facility  is also prohibited 
in the event that we were to violate any of the covenants in our credit facility  or if we were to violate the provisions of any of our other lending arrangements or of more than of our leases other than solely as a result of our initial public offering  the lender would have the right to accelerate repayment of all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  or to commence foreclosure proceedings on our assets

the market price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected by market volatility 
the market price of our common stock is expected to be highly volatile  both because of actual and perceived changes in our financial results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price may include  among other factors discussed in this section  the following actual or anticipated variations in comparable store sales or operating results  changes in financial estimates by research analysts  actual or anticipated changes in the united states economy or the retailing environment  changes in the market valuations of other footwear or retail companies  and announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  divestitures  joint ventures  financing transactions  securities offerings or other strategic initiatives 

table of contents we are controlled by a small group of shareholders whose interests may differ from other shareholders 
affiliates of peter edison and members of his family and our current management are our largest shareholders 
accordingly  they will continue to have significant influence in determining the outcome of all matters submitted to shareholders for approval  including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions 
the interests of these shareholders may differ from the interests of other shareholders  and their concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that may be favored by other shareholders 
as long as these people are our principal shareholders  they will have the power to significantly influence the election of our entire board of directors 
peter edison s employment agreement entitles to him a one time payment equal to three times his current base salary as defined in the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events  including following a change of control of the company if there is generally a material reduction in the nature of his duties or his base salary  or he is not allowed to participate in certain bonus plans 
for this purpose  a change of control generally includes the acquisition by a person or group of more of our common stock than that held by peter edison 
the public sale of our common stock by selling shareholders could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of market sales by our selling shareholders  including prior investors with registration rights  or the perception that these sales will occur 
these sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
our charter documents and missouri law may inhibit a takeover  which may cause a decline in the value of our stock 
provisions of our restated articles of incorporation  our restated bylaws and missouri law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if closing the transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders 
for example  our restated articles of incorporation provide  in part  that directors may be removed from office by our shareholders only for cause and by the affirmative vote of not less than two thirds of our outstanding shares and that vacancies may be filled only by a majority of remaining directors 
under our restated bylaws  shareholders must follow detailed notice and other requirements to nominate a candidate for director or to make shareholder proposals 
in addition  among other requirements  our restated bylaws require at least a two thirds vote of shareholders to call a special meeting 
moreover  missouri law and our bylaws provide that any action by written consent must be unanimous 
furthermore  our bylaws may be amended only by our board of directors 
certain amendments to our articles of incorporation require the vote of two thirds of our outstanding shares in certain circumstances  including the provisions of our articles of incorporation relating to business combinations  directors  bylaws  limitations on director liabilities and amendments to our articles of incorporation 
we are also generally subject to the business combination provisions under missouri law  which allow our board of directors to retain discretion over the approval of certain business combinations 
in our bylaws  we have elected to not be subject to the control shares acquisition provision under missouri law  which would deny an acquiror voting rights with respect to any shares of voting stock which increase its equity ownership to more than specified thresholds 
these and other provisions of missouri law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws  peter edison s substantial beneficial ownership position  our board s authority to issue preferred stock and the lack of cumulative voting in our articles may have the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board or otherwise to bring a matter before shareholders without our board s consent 
such items may reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited takeover proposal and may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock

the following section is qualified in its entirety by this more detailed information and our financial statements and the related notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a national  mall based  specialty retailer of distinctive footwear and accessories targeting young women who demand quality fashion products 
we feature private label and national brand dress casual and sport shoes  boots sandals and accessories 
as of january   in addition to our bakers stores  we operated the store wild pair chain that targets men and women between the ages of and who desire edgier  fashion forward footwear 
as of march  we operated stores  of which were bakers stores and were wild pair stores 
during the first quarter of  we completed our initial public offering generating net proceeds of million  converted million of convertible debt and redeemable securities into common stock  and repaid million of debt obligations 
this has significantly enhanced our financial position and has enabled us to remodel existing stores and open new stores 
during fiscal year we opened new stores 
as of january   we operated stores  of which were bakers stores and were wild pair stores 
we have developed new formats for our bakers and wild pair stores which have resulted in comparable store sales increases at new format stores that exceed our corporate average 
new format stores may not necessarily continue to achieve such above average growth beyond their first comparable year 
we have undertaken a program to remodel existing stores and open new stores which should result in more than of our bakers stores operating in the new format by the end of we expect remodeled stores to be closed for approximately six or seven weeks during the period of remodeling 
after experiencing a strong first half of  we experienced soft demand during the third quarter which largely offset the sales and gross margin gains of the first half 
net sales and gross margin recovered in the fourth quarter of  primarily due to the good performance of remodeled stores and new stores opened during the second half of the year 
net sales were million for fiscal year  an increase of 
table of contents million over fiscal year our gross profit increased by million but this increase was less than the million increase in our operating expenses for fiscal year as a result  our operating income decreased to million for fiscal year  from million for fiscal year  and our income before income taxes decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year in the first quarter of fiscal year  we completed the acquisition of store locations formerly operated as sam libby in states for million in cash from slj retail llc 
we also acquired the non inventory personal property  leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment related to the stores 
we began operating of these stores as wild pair stores and as bakers stores in april as a result of the sam libby acquisition  our results of operations for fiscal years  and are not comparable in some significant respects 
for comparison purposes  we classify our stores as comparable or non comparable 
a new store s sales are not included in comparable store sales until the thirteenth month of operation 
sales from remodeled stores are excluded from comparable store sales during the period of remodeling 
on march   we filed an amended annual report on form k a for fiscal and amended quarterly reports on form q a for first three quarters of fiscal which reflected a restatement of our financial statements to correct our accounting for landlord allowances and the commencement of lease terms 
on march   we entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement for a private placement 
see item business entry into agreement for private placement 
assuming the consummation of the private placement  we expect to receive approximately million to million in net proceeds 
if the private placement were not to close  we would expect to open new stores in fiscal  substantially all in our new format 
pending use of the net proceeds  the private placement would improve our financial position and liquidity and allow us to accelerate our expansion plans 
we expect to use the net proceeds from the private placement to open additional stores  remodel existing stores  repay indebtedness under our revolving line of credit and for other working capital purposes 
we expect the net proceeds of the private placement to allow us to open an additional stores in the fall of and to target the opening of new stores in fiscal  substantially all in the new format 
we expect the private placement to close in early april  but it is subject to closing conditions 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
these differences could be material to the financial statements 
for more information  please see note in the notes to the financial statements 
we believe that our application of accounting policies  and the estimates that are inherently required by these policies  are reasonable 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in first out retail inventory method 
permanent markdowns are recorded to reflect expected adjustments to retail prices in accordance with the retail inventory method 
the process of determining our expected adjustments to retail prices requires significant judgment by management 
among other factors  management utilizes performance metrics to evaluate the quality and freshness of inventory  including the number of weeks of supply on hand  sell through percentages and aging categories of inventory by selling season  to make its best estimate of the appropriate inventory markdowns 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory markdowns may be required 

table of contents store closing and impairment charges at the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets 
based on the criteria in sfas no 
 long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
we regularly analyze the operating results of our stores and assess the viability of under performing stores to determine whether they should be closed or whether their associated assets  including furniture  fixtures  equipment  and leasehold improvements  have been impaired 
asset impairment tests are performed at least annually  on a store by store basis 
after allowing for an appropriate start up period  unusual nonrecurring events  and favorable trends  fixed assets of stores indicated to be impaired are written down to fair value 
during the years ended january   january  and january   we recorded   and  respectively  in noncash charges to earnings related to the impairment of furniture  fixtures  and equipment  leasehold improvements and other assets 
deferred income taxes through january   we were an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code and comparable state tax laws  and consequently were not subject to income taxes on our earnings in those jurisdictions  other than state franchise and net worth taxes 
however  we were subject to income taxes in some states which do not recognize s corporation status 
our s corporation status was terminated effective january  and  as a result  we became subject to federal and state income taxes as a c corporation 
we calculate income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
inherent in the measurement of deferred taxes are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for the deferred tax assets because we generated taxable income in prior periods and we anticipate that future taxable income will be sufficient to allow us to fully realize the amount of net deferred tax assets 
fiscal year our accounting period is based upon a traditional retail calendar  which ends on the saturday nearest january prior to  our fiscal year ended four weeks prior to the retail calendar  as a result of our prior subchapter s tax status 
the fiscal years ended january   january  and january  were week periods 
the difference in the number of weeks for our fiscal years can affect yearly comparisons 
we refer to the fiscal year ended january  as fiscal year  to the fiscal year ended january  as fiscal year  and to the fiscal year ended january  as fiscal year on march   we announced that we have changed our fiscal year to the standard retail calendar  which closes on the saturday closest to the end of january 
we will have a four week transition period beginning on january  and ending january  our new fiscal year will begin on january  and will end on january  the results of the transition period will be reported on form q along with the results of the first quarter of fiscal year  ending april

net sales were million in fiscal year  up from million for fiscal year  an increase of million 
sales in the first quarter were strong  reflecting the fashion trend that started in the second half of sales in the second and third quarters were negatively impacted by customer demand for low priced flip flops and athletics and soft demand for back to school casuals 
fourth quarter sales improved due to strong demand in boots  closed casuals and branded footwear  and due to the good performance of remodeled stores and new stores opened during the second half of the year

 accounting for income taxes  we have reflected the net impact of the temporary differences between the book and tax basis of our assets and liabilities as of the date of conversion as a component of our provision for income taxes for we recognized a nonrecurring income tax benefit of million upon conversion to a c corporation offset by an income tax provision of million related to our income for fiscal year no valuation allowance has been provided for our net tax assets because we generated taxable income in prior periods and we anticipate that future taxable income will be sufficient to allow us to fully realize these tax assets 
because we were an s corporation during there was no comparable income tax benefit for that year 
on a pro forma basis  had we been a c corporation for  we would have had a tax provision of million for the year

fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  net sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  a decrease of million 
net sales were negatively impacted by a weak retail environment during the first quarter of related to consumer concerns regarding the war in iraq and the closure of stores 
in the second and third quarters of  sales were negatively impacted by teenage customer demand for low priced flip flops 
net sales were positively impacted by the inclusion of sales from the former sam libby stores for the full year in compared to only three quarters of and the reemergence of fashion trends during the fourth quarter of our comparable store sales for fiscal year decreased by compared to fiscal year comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year increased by compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit was million in both fiscal year and fiscal year gross profit for the first three quarters of decreased million compared to the first three quarters of  primarily due to increases in occupancy and buying expenses

as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year selling expense 
selling expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily attributable to more effective store payroll management in fiscal year  partially offset by a  increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to store fixtures and leaseholds

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the following table sets forth our summary operating results for the quarterly periods indicated 
fiscal year ended january  first second third fourth net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income loss fiscal year ended january  first second third fourth net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income loss fiscal year ended january  first second third fourth net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income loss our operating results are subject to significant seasonal variations 
our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  as a result of these seasonal variances  in particular our principal selling seasons 
we have five principal selling seasons transition post holiday  easter  back to school  fall and holiday 
sales and net income in our second and fourth quarters are typically much stronger than in our first and third quarters 
in addition to our normal seasonal fluctuations  some events  in particular the easter holiday  shift between fiscal quarters in some years due to the nature of our fiscal year 
this shift can influence our quarterly comparable results 
for example  easter occurred during the first quarter of fiscal year  while in most years  including fiscal years and  easter occurred during the second quarter 
quarterly comparisons may also be affected by the timing of sales promotions and costs associated with remodeling stores  opening new stores or acquiring stores 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources on february   we consummated our initial public offering with the sale of  shares of common stock 
on march   we sold an additional  shares in satisfaction of the underwriters over allotment option 
we received net proceeds of approximately million in the offering 
see initial public offering below for more information 
at january   we had total assets of million and shareholders equity of million compared to total assets of million and shareholders equity of million at january  at january   we had net working capital of million  and million of unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  based upon our borrowing base calculation  compared to negative net working capital of million and million of unused borrowing capacity at january  the improvement in our financial position primarily relates to the proceeds from our initial public offering  the conversion of our subordinated debentures and redeemable class a and class b common stock into common stock  and our net income in our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  capital expenditures and principal payments on our debt and capital lease obligations 
in connection with our prior s corporation status  we have also made cash distributions to our shareholders to cover their taxes 
historically  these needs for cash have been met by cash flows from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and sales of our subordinated debt 
we anticipate that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our operating cash requirements for at least the next months and will allow us to further execute our business plan  including our planned expansion 
assuming the consummation of the private placement  we expect to receive approximately between million and million in net proceeds 
if the private placement were not to close  we would expect to open new stores in fiscal  substantially all in our new format 
pending use of the net proceeds  the private placement would improve our financial position and liquidity and allow us to accelerate our expansion plans 
we expect to use the net proceeds from the private placement to open additional stores  remodel existing stores  repay indebtedness under our revolving line of credit and for other working capital purposes

operating activities for fiscal year  our net cash provided by operations was million compared to net cash provided by operations of million in fiscal year  a decrease of million 
the primary causes of this decrease were decreased operating income in and a million increase in inventories in compared to a million decrease in inventories in the year to year inventory changes relate primarily to the new stores opened in and to higher in transit inventory levels at the end of fiscal year as we prepared for an early easter in over two thirds of our products are currently manufactured in china 
recently the continued significant growth in the chinese economy has resulted in periodic energy and labor shortages  as well as transportation and shipping bottlenecks 
in addition  due to the volume of chinese imports  there have been delays at ports on the west coast of the united states 
we actively monitor these matters and have accelerated the timing of our product sourcing by approximately one week in order to minimize the impact of any production or transportation delays

a substantial portion of the capital expenditures relate to new and remodeled stores opened during the third and fourth quarters of our future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and the timing of these expenditures 
as of march   we have opened new stores in fiscal we plan to open approximately to new stores in fiscal year and new stores in fiscal year in addition  we anticipate using the net proceeds from the private placement to open an additional stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal capital expenditures for a new store including point of sale equipment are expected to average approximately  to  we generally receive landlord allowances in connection with new stores averaging  to  the average cash inventory investment for a new store is expected to range from approximately  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
pre opening expenses  such as marketing  salaries  supplies  rent and utilities are expensed as incurred 
remodeling the average existing store into the new format typically costs approximately  to  for stores that do not warrant this level of investment  the costs to remodel are approximately  we remodeled stores during fiscal as of march   we completed the remodeling of stores 
prior to the impact of the private placement  in connection with store openings and remodelings  we have projected our capital expenditures in fiscal year to be approximately million

 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r will require the company to  among other things  measure employee stock based compensation awards where applicable using a fair value method and record related expense in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of sfas r are effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   therefore  the company will adopt the new requirements no later than the beginning of its third quarter of fiscal adoption of the expensing requirements will reduce the company s reported earnings 
management is currently evaluating the specific impacts of adoption  which include whether the company should adopt the requirements on a retrospective basis and which valuation model is most appropriate 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings and cash flows may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates 
our financing arrangements include both fixed and variable rate debt in which changes in interest rates will impact the fixed and variable rate debt differently 
a change in the interest rate of fixed rate debt will impact the fair value of the debt  whereas a change in the interest rate on the variable rate debt will impact interest expense and cash flows 
management does not believe that the risk associated with changing interest rates would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
impact of inflation overall  we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
we cannot give assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future
