overview the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
the exploration company is an independent oil and gas enterprise with interests primarily in the maverick basin in southwest texas 
the company has a consistent record of long term growth in its proved oil and gas reserves  leasehold acreage position  production and cash flow through its established exploration and development programs 
its business strategy is to build shareholder value by acquiring undeveloped mineral interests and internally developing a multi year drilling inventory through the use of advanced technologies  such as d seismic and horizontal drilling 
the company accounts for its oil and gas operations under the successful efforts method of accounting and trades its common stock on the nasdaq stock market sm under the symbol txco 
the company currently has four drilling rigs under operation on its extensive  acre position in the maverick basin  targeting at least three separate formations for the production of oil and natural gas 
completions in included gas and oil wells  which included two wells spud in and six re entries during  while wells spud during the year remained in progress at year end 
current emphasis is on the georgetown  san miguel and glen rose formations 
the capital expenditures budget includes funds for new wells in the georgetown formation  six in the glen rose formation and in the san miguel formation and four re entries  as well as funds for seismic and lease acquisitions 
due to the number of promising prospects on our maverick basin acreage  and higher oil and gas prices  drilling activity remained high during for further discussion of this activity  see the 
principal areas of activity and 
drilling activity sections of this form k 
the resulting increased expenditures should translate into continued increases to reserves as adequate production history is established 
revenues and credit capacity for future activity should continue to grow as the result of the increased drilling activity 
recognition of additional reserves on newly drilled wells requires a period of sustained production  causing a delay between the expenditures and the recording of reserves 
txco reported net income of million or per basic share  per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net income of  or per basic and diluted share for the prior year 
major contributors to this improvement were higher average sales prices  increased margin on gas gathering activities  and increased production on an equivalent unit basis 
offsetting these improvements were increases in lease operating expenses  depreciation and depletion  and interest expense 
these factors are discussed in the 
results of operations section 
txco continued its ongoing trend of strong annual reserve growth in as it recorded net proved reserve additions of bcfe 
combined with annual production of bcfe  txco s gross reserve additions for the year were bcfe 
estimated year end proved oil and gas reserves were a record bcfe  a third above its at year end the company achieved a percent all source reserve replacement rate in positive cash flow provided from operations totaled million  an increase over the prior year 
the following table illustrates key features of the company s continuous development over the four fiscal years presented

in december  txco retained raymond james associates to assist in actively pursuing strategic alternatives designed to enhance shareholder value  including a merger or sale of the company 
no formal decisions have been made and no agreements have been reached at this time 
there can be no assurances that any particular alternative will be pursued or that any transaction will occur  or on what terms 
capital resources and liquidity liquidity is a measure of ability to access cash 
the company s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties  repayment of contractual obligations and working capital funding 
txco has historically addressed its long term liquidity requirements through cash provided by operating activities  the issuance of equity securities when market conditions permit  sale of non strategic assets  and more recently through the 
credit facility and issuance of 
redeemable preferred stock 
the prices for future oil and natural gas production and the level of production have significant impacts on operating cash flows and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
management continues to examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of common stock  the sales of non strategic assets  and joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  txco s ability to execute its operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond its control 
management believes that projected operating cash flows  cash on hand  and borrowings under the credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the requirements of txco s business 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and oil and natural gas prices 
no assurances can be made that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures or that increased capital expenditures will not be undertaken 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to a variety of factors  including but not limited to drilling results  product pricing and future acquisition and divestitures of properties 
bank credit facility on june   the company closed on a million senior secured revolving credit facility with guaranty bank the facility or credit facility 
the facility has a three year term expiring in it replaces txco s prior million credit facility with hibernia national bank  which was scheduled to mature in the credit facility is collateralized by all of the company s proven oil and gas properties  with an initial borrowing base of million  based on then current levels of txco s oil and gas reserves  and features semi annual redeterminations 
the borrowing base was increased to  in october interest under the facility will be as much as percentage point less than the former credit agreement  based on  at txco s option  a the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to or b prime plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
at december   the company had outstanding million with a weighted average interest rate of 
an additional million was advanced during january of  bringing the total outstanding to million 
when borrowing under the facility exceeds of the borrowing base  the company is required to hedge volumes equivalent to of its production at the inception of the facility 
the company entered into financial price hedges in october in early march  the company entered into additional financial price hedges 
the company did not elect hedge accounting treatment for these agreements 
accordingly  the hedges are marked to market  and the change in market value is recorded on the income statement each period as derivative fair value gains or losses impacting the volatility of reported earnings 
the facility contains additional terms and conditions consistent with similarly positioned companies 
these conditions include various restrictive covenants such as minimum levels of interest coverage  tangible net worth and current ratio  a maximum debt to ebitdax ratio  restricting the payment of dividends other than the dividends payable under the redeemable preferred stock  and prohibiting a change of control or incurring additional debt 
at december   the company was not in compliance with the current ratio covenant 
concurrently  on march   txco received a commitment from guaranty bank to increase its borrowing base to million from the previous amount of million  as well as a waiver for the covenant requirement at december  the company expects to be in compliance with this covenant at march  and subsequent periods 
accordingly  the facility is classified as long term 
capital requirements outlook overall management believes the facility  along with the company s positive cash flow from existing production and anticipated production increases from new drilling  will provide adequate capital to fund operating cash requirements and complete its scheduled exploration and development goals for txco expects to further increase its borrowing base commensurate with the expected growth of its proved oil and gas reserves throughout the base term of the facility 
should product prices weaken  or expected new oil and gas production levels not be attained  the resulting reduction in projected revenues would cause the company to re evaluate its working capital options and would adversely affect the company s ability to carry out its current operating plans 
the major components of the company s plans  and the requirements for additional capital for  include the following maverick basin activity initial capital expenditures for are planned to be in the range of million to million and target the company s maverick basin core properties 
the primary component of these expenditures is million for drilling wells 
almost million is earmarked for seismic and leasehold enhancements and other infrastructure expansion activities 
the company s budgeted capital expenditures are intended to be flexible 
the budget may expand or contract based on drilling results  operational developments  unanticipated transaction opportunities  market conditions  commodity price fluctuations and working capital availability 
the company plans to drill or re enter wells  including georgetown wells  including gas and nine oil wells  san miguel waterflood oil wells  three glen rose horizontal shoal or reef gas wells  and six glen rose porosity zone oil wells 
the porosity wells include three new wells and three re entries 
other companies will operate some of these wells and  therefore  txco does not have direct control over when they will be drilled or what final costs will actually be incurred 
the following table details typical gross well costs budgeted for wells typical gross well costs dry hole completed glen rose oil porosity zone horizontal well glen rose shoal horizontal gas well glen rose reef vertical gas well georgetown horizontal gas well southern georgetown horizontal oil well northern san miguel waterflood oil well williston basin activity the company plans to maintain its existing producing properties and the payment of delay rentals and lease extensions on selected undeveloped leases  with scheduled delay rentals of  txco will continue in its efforts to offer remaining acreage  seismic data  and identified prospects to other industry operators 
txco participated in the drilling or re entry of three wells in the williston basin during and anticipates additional activity during sources and uses of cash for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for  up from million for total cash available from all sources  listed in the following table  provided million for use in the ongoing expansion  development and exploration of the company s oil and gas properties

as a result of these activities  the company ended with a current ratio of to and a negative working capital of million  compared with to and negative million  respectively  at december  burr ranch acquisition in january  the company acquired the  acre burr ranch lease 
the acreage is contiguous to its existing acreage block and the company believes it has excellent potential to establish production from the glen rose  georgetown and jurassic intervals 
the company entered into an unsecured installment obligation with the mineral owner in connection with this acquisition 
imputed interest due on the obligation is per annum 
subsequent to year end  installments of million were made in january of and sources and uses of cash for the year ended december  during  cash from all sources  listed below  resulted in total cash of million available for use in meeting the company s ongoing operational and development needs 
included in the cash received from other sources  are funds raised from a private placement of  shares of restricted common stock to a group of institutional investors 
the amount raised was used for acquisitions  to accelerate the development of the company s extensive maverick basin acreage holdings and for general corporate purposes 
pursuant to the placement agreement  the company filed a form s registration statement dated june   covering the issued shares on behalf of the investors

txco s initial interest million was purchased through its newly formed maverick dimmit pipeline  ltd 
partnership the partnership 
the remaining of the partnership was held by an unaffiliated private energy concern 
this acquisition was funded with proceeds from a million private placement also closed in may 
in june  the partnership acquired an additional miles of pipeline from txco s owned subsidiary  the paloma pipeline lp  for million 
the partnership constructed a mile   pipeline extension to connect the company s growing chittim lease production to the pipeline system 
this extension was placed in service early in the fourth quarter 
during the fourth quarter  txco consolidated its position by acquiring the outstanding minority interest in maverick dimmit pipeline  ltd  at its book value of million 
the consolidation was funded through txco s available credit facility 
pena creek acquisition also in may  the company acquired the pena creek oil field in dimmit county  texas  from merit energy company for million 
the purchase was effective april  the acquisition consisted of producing oil wells  injection wells and shut in wells 
as a result of these activities  the company ended with a negative working capital of  and a current ratio of 
to this year end position compares to negative working capital of  and a current ratio of 
to at december  the company ended with an unused borrowing base of million

total revenues for increased by million compared to natural gas sales volumes increased by mmcf while oil sales volumes declined by  bo as compared with the prior year 
gas gathering revenues increased by million over levels 
the increase in natural gas sales volumes was primarily due to pena creek  georgetown and chittim glen rose horizontal wells placed on production in the decline in oil sales volumes compared to the prior year reflects the delay in drilling in the glen rose porosity play due to a partner s restructuring 
on an equivalent unit basis  prices averaged higher in as compared to crude oil prices averaged higher while natural gas prices were up 
average higher prices for  as compared to  had a million positive impact on revenues in commodity prices have been  and continue to be  volatile 
during  realized gas prices ranged from a high of per mcf in november to a low of per mcf in september  while realized crude oil prices ranged from a high of in october to a low of in february 
during  realized natural gas prices ranged from a high of per mcf in march to a low of per mcf in nov ember  with realized crude oil prices ranging from a high of in february to a low of in may 
average daily net gas sales rates in increased to mmcf  a increase from the prior year  as production from new wells greatly exceeded the normal decline in aging gas well production 
average daily net oil production rates in decreased to bbls  a decline from the prior year  primarily as a result of the delay in drilling mentioned above 
lease operating expense for increased million  from million in to million in  a increase 
this increase is primarily due to the addition of new oil wells and new natural gas wells during the increase reflects the incremental direct costs of operating the new wells  including the usual costs such as pumper  electricity  water disposal  and other direct overhead charges 
operating expense per mcfe increased from in to in typically  waterfloods incur higher costs of operations 
excluding the pena creek field  operating expense per mcfe for is  an increase of from the prior year 
also  included in operating costs is the cost of operating the cbm wells 
these costs totaled  in and  in the cbm wells are in the dewatering phase and therefore have little production relative to their operating costs 
operating cost per mcfe excluding the cbm wells and pena creek ave raged in and in pursuant to the successful efforts method of accounting for mineral properties  the company periodically assesses its producing and non producing properties for impairment 
impairment and abandonments decreased by primarily due to lower impairment rates 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million  or  over due primarily to the increased number of producing wells being depleted for wells added through the drill bit 
the increase in depreciation was due to increased investments in other equipment including computer  pipeline and well service equipment additions 
the increase in amortization was primarily due to the acquisition of d seismic and additional loan fees 
gas gathering operations revenues increased in as compared to related operating expenses increased from in these increases are consistent with the increased number of gas wells connected to the gathering system compared to the prior period  as well as higher average sales prices 
while general and administrative costs increased when compared to levels  they represented only of revenues 
this compares favorably to when general and administrative expenses were of revenues 
the higher level of absolute dollar costs reflects the higher sustained level of company operations and is attributable to higher salaries  benefits  and office related expenses associated with a full year of costs related to the employees hired across the organization during  along with a partial year for the three new employees hired during  as well as a  non cash compensation charge relating to one year extensions of the expiration date for a non qualified option and warrant 
also contributing to the increase were higher costs for public company and investor relations related expenses  and professional services 
increases in general and administrative costs are consistent with the expanded compliance burden mandated by the adop tion of the sarbanes oxley act in mid  see sarbanes oxley section implementation for additional discussion 
these particular costs are likely to continue to increase as the compliance burden expands 
the increase in interest income reflects slightly higher average cash levels in interest bearing accounts 
interest expense increased by million in from due to higher average debt levels  reflecting a full year of interest on the 
redeemable preferred stock issued in august and slightly higher average interest rates on the credit facility 
a portion of the interest expense is a non cash accrual reflecting the accretion of the liability on the preferred stock to its full redemption value  which is classified as a long term liability on the balance sheet 
the derivative fair value loss of  represents the net of the unrealized fair value gain at december  of  and the  in cash settlements for closed periods 
compared to the company reported a net income of  or per basic and diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share for the prior year 
revenues for increased by million compared to production increased on a bcfe basis  from bcfe in to bcfe in oil production increased by mbbl while natural gas production declined by mmcf as compared with the prior year 
the increase in oil production was due to the new glen rose oil wells drilled during  as well as a full year of production from the pena creek field acquired in may the decline in gas production compared to the prior year reflects the general production decline of the company s existing mix of maturing gas wells 
this decline was partially offset by gas production from the new gas wells drilled and completed during the year 
three new gas wells came on production in the fourth quarter 
on an equivalent unit basis  prices averaged higher in as compared to crude oil prices averaged higher while natural gas prices rose 
average higher prices for  as comp ared to  had a million positive impact on revenues in commodity prices continue to be volatile 
during  realized gas prices ranged from a high of per mcf in november to a low of per mcf in february 
during realized natural gas prices ranged from a high of per mcf in march to a low of per mcf in november 
average daily net gas production rates in decreased to mmcf  a decline from the prior year  while average daily net oil production rates in increased to  bbls  up over the prior year 
lease operating expense loe for increased  from million in to million in  an increase 
this increase was primarily due to the addition of new natural gas wells and new oil wells during and a full year of operations on the active pena creek wells acquired in mid the increase reflects the incremental direct costs of operating the new wells  including typical costs such as pumper  electricity  water disposal  and other direct overhead charges  as added during to the company s existing lease operating expense levels 
operating expense  which adds production taxes to loe  per mcfe increased from in to in the increase in the rate reflects a full year of pena creek field operations  which consists of three waterflood units 
typically  waterfloods incur higher costs of operations 
excluding the pena creek field  operating expense per mcfe for is 
also  included in operating co sts is the cost of operating the cbm wells 
these costs totaled  in and  in the cbm wells are in the dewatering phase and therefore have little production relative to their operating costs 
operating cost per mcfe excluding the cbm wells and pena creek averaged in and in impairment and abandonments increased by over primarily due to higher impairment on producing properties  as production from new plays  such as the glen rose oil porosity  did not establish the production rates that were expected 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by over million  or  over due primarily to the increased number of producing wells being depleted  for wells added through the drill bit and a full year activity for the pena creek wells acquired in may also contributing to the increase in depreciation was the first full year of depreciation on the pipeline and well service equipment acquired in mid data for reflects the first full year of operations for the company s gas gathering system that was acquired in may therefore  comparisons of to are not meaningful 
while general and administrative costs increased when compared to levels  they were of revenues 
this compares favorably to when general and administrative expenses were of revenues 
the higher level of absolute dollar costs reflects the higher sustained level of company operations  and is primarily attributable to higher salaries  wages and benefits and office related expenses associated with new full time employees across the organization during  as well as increased directors fees 
also contributing to the increase were higher costs for property and liability insurance 
in addition  increases in general and administrative costs are consistent with the expanded compliance burden mandated by the adoption of the sarbanes oxley act in mid the decrease in interest income reflects the low average cash levels in interest bearing accounts 
interest expense increased by million in from due to higher debt levels  reflecting the 
redeemable preferred stock issuance in august of  and higher average balances on the credit facility 
a portion of the interest expense is an accrual reflecting the accretion of the liability on the preferred stock to its full redemption value  which is classified as a long term liability on the balance sheet 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following is a summary of the company s future payments on obligations as of december  payments due by period after contractual obligations year years years years total long term debt redeemable preferred stock operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in 
note a to the audited consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations  and require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to reserves  depletion and impairment of oil and gas properties  and the ultimate utilization of the deferred tax asset  and base our estimates on historical exper ience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements successful efforts method of accounting the company accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells  costs to acquire mineral interests and d seismic costs are capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses including d seismic costs and delay rentals for oil and gas leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense  net of salvage value  if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and ultimately deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment or recompletion of the wells at later dates 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
the evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these co sts with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when the company is entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding an oil and gas field that will be the focus of future development drilling activity 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed 
reserve estimates the company s estimates of oil and gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and w orkover gas costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of the oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures  with respect to the company s reserves  will likely vary from estimates and such variances may be material 
txco contracts with an independent engineering firm t o provide reserve estimates for reporting purposes 
impairment of oil and gas properties the company reviews its oil and gas properties for impairment at least annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
the company estimates the expected future cash flows of its oil and gas properties and compares such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that would require the company to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with oil and gas properties 
the company has recognized impairments in both the current and prior years and there can be no assurance that impairments will not be required in the future 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes on its operations 
when recording income tax expense or benefit  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of the calendar year  b tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses or benefits are recognized 
the company has deferred tax assets relating to tax net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when management believes that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized  or if likely realization may be many years in the future 
the company s deferred tax assets exceeded its liabilities at december   and based on the company s projected profitability  a valuation allowance was recorded of approximately million at december  and million at december   resulting in a net deferred tax asset at each respective year end of million 
although the company believes the valuation allowance and resulting deferred tax asset is reasonable  the ultimate recoverability or utilization of the asset is subject to change in future years for reasons explained above
