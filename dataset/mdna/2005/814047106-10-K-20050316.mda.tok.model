item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion reviews our results of operations and assesses our financial condition 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview security bank corporation was incorporated on february  for the purpose of becoming a bank holding company 
we are subject to extensive federal and state banking laws and regulations  including the bank holding company act of and the bank holding company laws of georgia 
we own three subsidiary banks security bank of bibb county  security bank of houston county and security bank of jones county 
we also own fairfield financial services  inc  an operating subsidiary of security bank of bibb county 
our subsidiaries are also subject to various federal and state banking laws and regulations 
like most financial institutions  our profitability depends largely upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses  non interest expenses  such as salaries  employee benefits  and occupancy expenses  and non interest income  such as mortgage loan fees and service charges on deposit accounts 
economic conditions  competition and federal monetary and fiscal policies also affect financial institutions 
for example  was characterized by several increases in the federal reserve s target federal funds rate in the second half of the year to reduce inflationary pressures and  therefore  sustain the pace of economic growth 
lending activities are also influenced by regional and local economic factors  such as housing supply and demand  competition among lenders  customer preferences and levels of personal income and savings in our primary market area 
our balanced growth continued during  with increases in assets  deposits  shareholders equity  earnings per share and returns on average assets and equity 
the following chart shows our growth in these areas from december  to december  december  december  percent increase dollars in millions  except per share amounts diluted earnings per share total assets loans investment securities deposits shareholders equity return on average assets return on average equity an increase in loan volume of million in loans as a result of strong loan demand in a low interest rate environment was the primary contributor to an increase in net income to million for the increase in deposits of million resulted from marketing efforts aimed at increasing local low cost deposits and funding requirements driven by our loan growth 
we sometimes met these funding needs with out of market deposits  which often carried a lower cost than local market deposits as a result of competitive pricing within our markets 
our investment portfolio increased million during  primarily in order to provide on balance sheet liquidity in support of strong loan demand 
the overall level of investment securities declined to of assets at the end of  as compared to of assets at the end of fairfield financial closed over million in residential mortgage loans during and posted approximately million in net income 
approximately of its gross revenue was a product of its traditional residential mortgage origination business  with the remaining being derived from its interim real estate and real estate development lending activities

in connection with the application of those principles  we have made judgments and estimates which  in the case of the determination of our allowance for loan losses all  goodwill and stock based compensation have been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for loan losses all our management assesses the adequacy of the all prior to the end of each calendar quarter 
this assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance 
the all consists of two portions an allocated amount representative of specifically identified credit exposure and exposures that are readily predictable by historical or comparative experience  and  an unallocated amount representative of inherent loss that is not readily identifiable 
even though the all is composed of two components  the entire all is available to absorb any credit losses 
we establish the allocated amount separately for three tiers substandard loans with specific allocations based on collateral exposure  loans based on five different credit ratings watch list  other assets specifically mentioned  substandard  doubtful and loss with allocations based on historical losses per rating category  and the rest of the loan portfolio with allocations based on historical losses in the total portfolio 
we base the allocation for unique loans primarily on risk rating grades assigned to each of these loans as a result of our loan management and review processes 
we then assign each risk rating grade a loss ratio  which is determined based on the experience of management  discussions with banking regulators and our independent loan review process 
the unallocated amount is particularly subjective and does not lend itself to exact mathematical calculation 
the unallocated amount represents estimated inherent credit losses which may exist  but have not yet been identified  as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating the unallocated amount  we apply two stress factors 
the first stress factor consists of economic factors including such matters as changes in the local or national economy  the depth or experience in the lending staff  any concentrations of credit in any particular industry group  and new banking laws or regulations 
the second stress factor is based on the credit grade of the loans in our unsecured loan portfolio 
after we assess applicable factors  we evaluate the aggregate unallocated amount based on our management s experience 
we then test the resulting all balance by comparing the balance in the all with historical trends and peer information 
our management then evaluates the result of the procedures performed  including the result of our testing  and makes a conclusion regarding the appropriateness of the balance of the all in its entirety 
the directors loan committee reviews the assessments prior to the filing of quarterly and annual financial information 
in assessing the adequacy of the all  we also rely on an ongoing independent loan review process 
we undertake this process both to ascertain whether there are loans in the portfolio whose credit quality has weakened over time and to assist in our overall evaluation of the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio 
our loan review process includes the judgment of management  the input of our independent loan reviewer  who is not an employee of ours  and reviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their usual examination process 
stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  management has elected to expense the fair value of stock options 
we utilize the black scholes model in determining the fair value of the stock options 
the model takes into account certain estimated factors such as the expected life of the stock option and the volatility of the stock 
the expected life of the stock option is a function of the vesting period of the grant  the average length of time similar grants have remained outstanding  and the expected volatility of the underlying stock 
volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during a period 
goodwill effective january   the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets was adopted 
in accordance with this statement  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives no longer are being amortized but will be subject to impairment tests in accordance with the pronouncement 
other intangible assets  primarily core deposits  will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in  the required impairment testing of goodwill was performed and no impairment existed as of the valuation date  as the fair value of our net assets exceeded their carrying value 
if for any future period we determine that there has been impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill balances  we will record a charge to our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our net income

average earning assets used in ratios as follows in thousands   and  compared to net interest income 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for the year ended december  increased million to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was attributable to an increase of million  or  in interest income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net interest rate spread the yield on earning assets minus the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   while the net interest margin net interest income on a tax equivalent basis divided by average earning assets increased basis points from to during the same period 
the increase in both the net interest rate spread and net interest rate margin in was primarily reflective of a basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  while the yield on earning assets declined basis points 
although the average cost of interest bearing demand deposits and money market accounts was virtually unchanged  we were able to significantly reduce the costs of time deposits as longer term  higher rate time deposits matured in a lower rate environment and we were able to reprice the renewals at lower rates 
new time deposit money raised in the lower rate environment also reduced the weighted average cost of the total time deposit portfolio 
meanwhile  the loan portfolio yield declined basis points as higher yielding fixed rate loans repriced at lower rates and variable rate loans with interest rate floors did not participate fully in rate increases in the second half of interest income 
interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the year ended december  interest income on loans and investment securities increased million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest income on loans for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in average balance of million  of which million was attributable to including in a full year of loan balances acquired from security bank of jones county in may included months of these balances 
interest income on investment securities increased million as a result of an increase of million in average balance for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and an increase of basis points in the average yield on these securities during the same period 
the primary reason for the increase in the average balance of investment securities of million was to maintain the level of investment securities as a percent of total assets  so that on balance sheet liquidity would keep pace with loan growth 
at december   investment securities equaled of assets  as compared to at december  overall  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points from during the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense increased million  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from an increase of million in interest expense on deposits 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits  the largest component of interest expense  declined by basis points and the average balance increased by million 
of the million increase in average balances  interest bearing accounts increased million  money market accounts increased million and savings accounts increased million  primarily as a result of our increased marketing efforts to bring in low cost deposits 
time deposits  the largest category of deposits  increased million  primarily due to the increase in brokered and internet based cd s to fund loan growth in the fairfield interim lending acquisition and development division 
the interest expense on borrowed funds in was relatively unchanged when compared to a decline in the average balance in borrowed funds of million was offset by an increase in the average cost of borrowed funds of basis points  which resulted in a net increase in the cost of other borrowings of  when comparing to compared to net interest income 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for the year ended december  increased million to million from million during the year ended december  this increase was attributable to the increase of million in interest income during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net interest rate spread increased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   and the net interest rate margin increased basis points from to during the same period 
the increase in both the net interest rate spread and net interest rate margin reflected an basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities as a result of a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities 
the shift occurred between borrowings  local cds or wholesale cds depending on the interest rate at the time of funding needs 
additionally  as a result of the strategy we used to price borrowings  borrowing costs declined during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the average cost of borrowed funds declining basis points during the period 
during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the average balance of deposits  including non interest bearing checking accounts  increased a total of million 
of this increase  million was attributable to ongoing deposit marketing promotions to bring in low cost deposits  and million was attributable to our acquisition of security bank of jones county 
excluding the impact of our acquisition of security bank of jones county  net interest income for the year ended december  increased million 
this increase was attributable to a decline of million in interest expense that was offset by an increase of million in interest income during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net interest rate spread increased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest income 
interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million during the year ended december   an increase of million from million during the year ended december  interest income on loans and investment securities increased million and  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest income on loans during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in average balance of million  of which million was attributable to our acquisition of security bank of jones county 
excluding the impact of the additional loans from security bank of jones county  the existing loan portfolio declined basis points in average yield during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  interest income on investment securities increased  as a result of an increase of million in average balance during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was partially offset by a reduction of basis points in the average yield on these securities during the same period 
excluding the impact of our acquisition of security bank of jones county  the investment securities decreased million in average balance during this decline was due to our general policy to emphasize growth in loans as its primary interest earning asset  and de emphasize its investment portfolios  while loan origination demand is strong 
the decline in average balance also reflects maturity and call activity experienced on these securities as a result of the lower interest rate environment during the decline in average yield reflects the decline in interest rates during  as higher coupon securities were called from the portfolio 
overall  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense increased million  to million  during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from an increase of  in interest expense on deposits 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits  the largest component of interest expense  declined by basis points and the average balance increased by million  resulting in an increase in interest expense of  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  excluding the impact of the interest bearing deposits resulting from our acquisition of security bank of jones county  average balances increased million and average yield declined basis points resulting in a decrease of interest expense of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  of the million increase in average balances  interest bearing accounts increased million  money market accounts increased million and savings accounts increased million  all as a result of our increased marketing efforts to bring in low cost deposits 
brokered cds increased million  wholesale cds increased million  and traditional cds decreased million  which resulted from our shift to low cost  out of market deposits 
the increase in interest expense also resulted from a  increase in borrowed funds  which further resulted from increases of million in the average balance of borrowed funds and basis points in the average cost of borrowed funds during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in borrowed funds consists primarily of million in subordinated debentures relating to our offering of trust preferred securities

provision for loan losses the general nature of lending results in periodic charge offs  in spite of our continuous loan review process  credit standards  and internal controls 
during and  we factored into our provision for loan losses a subjective assessment of the economic downturn s effect on the cash flow of some of our borrowers 
we expensed million in  in  and million in for loan loss provisions 
the slight decrease in s provision for loan losses was primarily due to a low level of net charge offs as compared to the company s five year average of net charge offs 
our net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were in  in  and in s level of net charge offs to average loans of was low compared to the five year average of 
amounts of net loans charged off during recent years are reasonable by industry standards and are below peer group institutions of similar asset size 
we incurred net charge offs of million in  compared to million during  and million during the reserve for loan losses on december  stood at of outstanding net loans and loans held for sale  down from at december  and up from at december  non interest income non interest income of million in represented a decrease  or million from million recorded in service charges on deposit accounts  which constitute of non interest income  are the largest component of non interest income  generating million for  up from million in service charges on deposit accounts  which are primarily fees generated from our courtesy overdraft protection product  accounted for million  or of all service charges 
the courtesy overdraft product completed its third full year in  but its growth was enhanced by the success of the high performance checking program 
the second largest component of non interest income is mortgage loan fees  which constituted of non interest income during during  mortgage loans fees decreased million from million to million 
the decrease in mortgage loan fees is attributable to the slow down in the refinance market due to increasing interest rates 
this decline was offset by commissions and fees generated by fairfield financial s interim lending division 
commissions and fees increased to million over amounts reported in non interest expense non interest expense was million for the year ended  up or million  from million in salaries and benefits  the largest component of non interest expense constituting of non interest expense  increased million to million from million in the overall increase is due to normal salary and benefit increases from merit increases and from new hires 
this increase was offset by a decline in mortgage commissions paid in of million  due to a lower level of associated mortgage revenues from the less favorable refinance market seen in all other operating overhead increased by million or 
the primary increases were due to increases in directors fees and audit and accounting fees primarily attributable to compliance with sarbanes oxley section income tax expense our consolidated federal and state income tax expense increased to million in  up from in and million in the effective tax rate was   and in  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate has historically been at or just below the maximum corporate federal and state income tax rates due to the relatively small percentage of tax free investments carried on the balance sheet 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed analysis of income taxes 
with the addition of security bank of jones county in  which had a lower effective tax rate  the blended effect reduced our overall effective tax rate

loan portfolio risk elements loan quality nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  loans restructured due to debtors financial difficulties  loans past due days or more as to interest or principal and still accruing  and other real estate owned  which is real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossession 
nonaccrual loans are those loans on which recognition of interest income has been discontinued 
restructured loans generally allow for an extension of the original repayment period or a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
loans  whether secured or unsecured  are generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal and or interest is days or more past due  or sooner if it is known or expected that the collection of all principal and or interest is unlikely 
other real estate owned is initially recorded at the lower of cost or estimated market value at the date of acquisition 
a provision for estimated losses is recorded when a subsequent decline in value occurs 
nonperforming assets at december   amounted to million  which is essentially unchanged from the level of nonperforming assets at december  however  the level of nonperforming assets as a percent of loans and other real estate at december  was down to from at december  nonperforming assets at december  amounted to approximately million  or of total loans and other real estate 
this compares to approximately million in nonperforming assets  or of total loans and other real estate  at december  we acquired million of nonperforming assets from security bank of jones county in may  of which million remained at december  excluding these assets  nonperforming assets increased  or  versus december  the following table sets forth our nonaccrual  restructured and past due loans  along with other real estate owned at the end of the past five years  and the amount of interest foregone in on our nonperforming assets

at december  and december   there were no other loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss or doubtful that are not included in the table above  but there were other loans classified for regulatory purposes as substandard or special mention that are not included in the table above 
however  management is aware of no such substandard or special mention loans not included above which i represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or ii represent material credits about which any information causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
we have no loans in our portfolio to borrowers in foreign countries 
loan concentrations exist when large amounts of money are loaned to multiple borrowers who would be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
the loan portfolio is concentrated in various commercial  real estate and consumer loans to individuals and entities located in middle georgia and in other georgia markets where fairfield financial operates loan offices 
accordingly  the ultimate collectibility of the loans is largely dependent upon economic conditions in these georgia markets 
other than our geographic concentrations due to our physical location and the loan type concentrations as shown in the above table  we have no other concentrations of loans that exceed of our total loan portfolio as of december  we have no other interest bearing assets that would be required to be disclosed as nonperforming assets if they were loans 
summary of loan loss experience the following table summarizes loans charged off  recoveries of loans previously charged off and additions to the reserve that have been charged to operating expense for the periods indicated 
we have no lease financing or foreign loans

the provision for loan losses represents management s determination of the amount necessary to be transferred to the reserve for loan losses to maintain a level that it considers adequate in relation to the risk of future losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
it is the policy of our subsidiary banks to provide for exposure to losses principally through an ongoing loan review process 
this review process is undertaken to ascertain any probable losses that must be charged off and to assess the risk characteristics of individually significant loans and of the portfolio in the aggregate 
this review takes into consideration the judgments of the responsible lending officers and the loan committees of our subsidiary banks boards of directors  and also those of the regulatory agencies that review the loans as part of their regular examination process 
during routine examinations of banks  the primary banking regulators may  from time to time  require additions to banks provisions for loan losses and reserves for loan losses if the regulators credit evaluations differ from those of management 
in addition to ongoing internal loan reviews and risk assessment  management uses other factors to judge the adequacy of the reserve  including current economic conditions  loan loss experience  regulatory guidelines and current levels of non performing loans 
management believes that the balance of million in the reserve for loan losses at december  and the balance of million in the reserve for loan losses at december  were adequate to absorb known risks in the loan portfolio at those dates 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in our loan portfolio 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  management  considering current information and events regarding the borrowers ability to repay their obligations  considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
when a loan becomes impaired  management calculates the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to measure the amount of impairment 
the amount of impairment and any subsequent changes are recorded  through a charge to earnings  as an adjustment to the loan loss reserve 
when management considers a loan  or a portion thereof  as uncollectible  it is charged against the reserve for loan losses 
an allocation of the reserve for loan losses has been made to provide for the possibility of incurred losses within the various loan categories 
the allocation is based primarily on previous charge off experience adjusted for risk characteristic changes among each category 
additional reserve amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the reserve for loan loss allocation is based on subjective judgment and estimates  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
the following table shows a five year comparison of the allocation of the reserve for loan losses

investment portfolio the investment securities portfolio is another major interest earning asset and consists of debt and equity securities categorized as either available for sale or held to maturity 
given our strong loan demand  the investment portfolio is viewed primarily as a source of liquidity  with yield as a secondary consideration 
because the investment portfolio is primarily for liquidity purposes  the investment portfolio has a relatively short effective duration of years 
the investment portfolio also serves to balance interest rate risk and credit risk related to the loan portfolio

no prepayment assumptions have been estimated in the table 
the weighted average yields are calculated on the basis of the amortized cost and effective yields of each security weighted for the scheduled maturity of each security 
the yield on state  county and municipal securities is computed on a tax equivalent basis using a statutory federal income tax rate of

see the discussion on page regarding our liquidity for additional details on the management of our deposit base 
to help generate additional local  low cost consumer core deposits  we continued a comprehensive marketing program during the program has been  in our view  extremely successful

the major component was million in various advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb under two separate programs 
our first program is a blanket agreement for advances and security agreement with the fhlb  under which our banks have pledged residential first mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans and investment securities as collateral to secure available lines of credit totaling million 
at december   our lending collateral value was million  million of which was outstanding 
these advances have maturities in varying amounts through march and interest rates ranging from to 
our second fhlb program allows for up to million in advances to our banks under a warehouse line secured by our loans held for sale 
at december   we had million in lending collateral value  with million in borrowings outstanding under our warehouse line at an interest rate of 
total outstanding advances from the fhlb averaged million during the year  with an average interest cost of 
of the million in fhlb advances outstanding at december   million  or  mature during the year another million  or  mature in  and the remaining million  or  mature after five years 
for the year  fhlb advances averaged million with an average interest cost of 
we have a line of credit with the bankers bank in atlanta  georgia totaling million 
the line is secured with the common stock of security bank of bibb county and indirectly the stock of fairfield financial as its subsidiary and security bank of houston county as collateral  and carries a floating interest rate of prime minus basis points 
we use the line of credit primarily to provide capital injections as necessary to our subsidiary banks 
at december   the outstanding balance on the line of credit was and million at december  the maximum aggregate indebtedness on the line during was million 
ten million of proceeds from our million common equity offering in may were used to pay down this line 
the average balance of debt under the bankers bank line of credit for the year was million at an average rate of

during the fourth quarter of  we formed a delaware statutory trust subsidiary whose sole purpose was to issue million in trust preferred securities subordinated debentures through a pool sponsored by ftn financial capital markets 
the proceeds from the offering were used to retire holding company debt and to fund our acquisition of security bank of jones county

we continue to exceed all minimum regulatory capital requirements as shown in the table below 
our equity capital of million at december  amounts to of total assets  compared to at december   and at december  on average  the equity capital was of assets during  compared to for and for the increase in the capital ratios in was primarily due to the raising of approximately million in new equity capital through a public stock offering we closed in early may with the sale of  common shares in the open market at a price of per share 

in june  our stock was added to the russell index  recognizing us as one of the largest  publicly traded companies in the us in terms of market capitalization 
our market capitalization increased from million at the end of to million at the end of  an increase of 
the increase in market capitalization was primarily due to our public stock offering discussed above  as well as  an increase of per share  or  in our common stock price from december  to december  principal uses of our capital base in recent years have been sustaining the capital adequacy of our subsidiaries as they continue to grow at a steady pace  expanding our presence in middle georgia with more physical locations and improved delivery systems  expanding into contiguous houston county through our acquisition of security bank of houston county and developing a mortgage loan division  acquiring fairfield financial to broaden and expand our mortgage services markets with new management talent and more physical locations throughout georgia  expanding into jones county through our acquisition of security bank of jones county  enhancing corporate infrastructure systems to support our multi bank environment  and opening a de novo branch in glynn county in potential uses of our capital base could include future acquisitions and de novo branches 
current regulatory standards require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum risk based capital ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of  with at least of the capital consisting of tier capital  and a tier leverage ratio of at least 
additionally  the regulatory agencies define a well capitalized bank as one that has a tier leverage ratio of at least  a tier capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
as of december   we had a tier leverage ratio of  a tier capital ratio of  and a total risk based capital ratio of  and were therefore well capitalized according to all regulatory guidelines 
maintaining these capital levels is crucial to our growth strategy  because the federal reserve bank of atlanta has indicated that it will not approve any future acquisition whereby the resulting combined company is not well capitalized at the holding company level 
the following table demonstrates capital ratio calculations as of december  and capital ratios in thousands december  as of end of period tier capital total equity capital less net unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities qualifying portion of trust preferred securities less disallowed goodwill and other intangible assets total tier capital tier capital eligible portion of reserve for loan losses qualifying portion of trust preferred securities subordinated and other qualifying debt total tier capital total risk based capital regulatory requirement december  minimum well capitalized total risk based capital ratio tier capital ratio tier capital to average assets cash dividends of  or per weighted average common share  were declared and paid during  up from  or per share  during and  or per share  in the ratios of cash dividends paid to net income for these years were  and  respectively 
since the commencement of cash dividend payments in  our board of directors has consistently declared and paid dividends on a quarterly basis 
as of december   million of our trust preferred securities was classified as tier capital under federal reserve board guidelines 
for regulatory purposes  the trust preferred securities represent a minority investment in a consolidated subsidiary  which is currently included in tier capital  so long as it does not exceed of total tier capital 
under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin and revised amendment to fin  however  the trust subsidiary must be deconsolidated for accounting purposes 
as a result  the federal reserve board is reconsidering its treatment of trust preferred securities as tier capital and could determine that a smaller maximum tier classification percentage is appropriate or disallow such classification altogether 
although we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this issue  we believe our capital ratios will remain at an adequate level to allow us to continue to be well capitalized under applicable banking regulations 
liquidity primarily through the actions of our subsidiary banks  we engage in liquidity management to ensure adequate cash flow for deposit withdrawals  credit commitments and repayments of borrowed funds 
liquidity needs are met through loan repayments  net interest and fee income  and the sale or maturity of existing assets 
in addition  liquidity is continuously provided through the acquisition of new deposits  the renewal of maturing deposits  and external borrowings 
management monitors deposit flow and evaluates alternate pricing structures to retain and grow deposits as needed 
to the extent needed to fund loan demand  traditional local deposit funding sources are supplemented by the use of fhlb borrowings  brokered deposits  and other wholesale deposit sources outside our immediate market area  including an internet based national cd service 
management has found that most non relationship oriented retail cds are interchangeable with wholesale funding sources such as brokered deposits and national market cds and alternates between these sources depending on the relative cost 
since we acquired fairfield financial in  the high volume and activity of its interim lending activities have required us to have higher levels of sophistication and internal tracking to ensure adequate liquidity across our organization 
we have developed more liquidity measurement tools for use on a consolidated basis 
we have updated internal policies to monitor the use of various core and non core funding sources and to balance ready access with risk and cost 
our asset liability management committee meets weekly to discuss liquidity related issues such as loan pipelines  deposit pricing and upcoming deposit maturities  among others 
through various asset liability management strategies  we maintain a balance among goals of liquidity  safety and earnings potential 
our subsidiary banks monitor internal policies that are consistent with regulatory liquidity guidelines 
the investment portfolio provides a ready means to raise cash if liquidity needs arise 
as of december   we held million in bonds excluding fhlb stock at current market value in our available for sale portfolio 
we purchase only marketable investment grade bonds 
although a portion of our bond portfolio is encumbered as pledges to secure various public funds deposits  repurchase agreements  and for other purposes  management can restructure and free up investment securities for sale if required to meet liquidity needs 
at december   approximately million  or  of our available for sale investment portfolio was pledged to secure deposits  repurchase agreements and for other related purposes 
management continues to emphasize programs to generate local core deposits as our primary funding source 
the stability of our core deposit base is an important factor in our liquidity position 
a heavy percentage of the deposit base is comprised of accounts of individuals and small businesses with comprehensive banking relationships and limited volatility 
at december  and  our subsidiary banks had million and million  respectively  in certificates of deposit of  or more 
these larger deposits represented and of respective total deposits 
management seeks to monitor and control the use of these larger certificates  which tend to be more volatile in nature  to ensure an adequate supply of funds as needed 
relative interest costs to attract local core relationships are compared to market rates of interest on various external deposit sources to help minimize our overall cost of funds 
our local market deposit sources were not sufficient to fund the strong loan growth trends of fairfield financial over the past four years 
our banks supplemented deposit sources with brokered deposits and internet based cds 
as of december  the banks reported million  or of total deposits  in brokered certificates of deposit attracted by external third parties with a weighted average rate of 
additionally  the banks use external wholesale or internet services to obtain out of market certificates of deposits at competitive interest rates when funding is needed 
as of december   the banks reported million in wholesale cds  representing of total deposits and carrying a weighted average rate of at year end 
to plan for contingent sources of funding not satisfied by both local and out of market deposit balances  we have established multiple borrowing sources to augment our funds management 
at the holding company level  we have an unsecured line of credit  and borrowing capacity also exists through the membership of our subsidiary banks in the federal home loan bank program 
at december   we had  at the holding company level  a million line of credit with the bankers bank  with million outstanding at year end 
this line of credit is secured by the common stock of two of our subsidiary banks and indirectly  the stock of fairfield financial 
based on the collateral value of assets pledged to the federal home loan bank at december  under our two programs for advances  our subsidiary banks had total borrowing capacity of up to million  of which million was drawn and outstanding at year end 
our subsidiary banks have also established overnight borrowing lines for federal funds purchased through various correspondent banks that collectively amounted to million in capacity at december  million of our federal funds lines were in use at year end 
management believes that the various funding sources discussed above are adequate to meet our liquidity needs in the future without any material adverse impact on operating results 
interest rate risk management we have successfully managed the level of our net interest margin since  despite the pressure on our net interest margin from a low interest rate environment 
our net interest margin was in  in  in  and in since we have aggressively worked to lower deposit costs to offset lower yields from the loan portfolio 
as noted above  we have been successful in generating low cost transaction accounts  as well as selectively alternating between retail cds  borrowed funds and internet brokered cds to generate the lowest cost funding sources available 
to help us manage fluctuations in our net interest income  we use simulation modeling to estimate the impact on net interest income of both the current level of market interest rates and for changes to the current level of market interest rates 
we measure the projected changes in market interest rates in terms of rate shifts of plus or minus  and basis points over the current levels of market interest rates 
we assume rate shifts occur ratably over a month measurement horizon 
we then use a new set of market interest rates to derive pricing for maturing or repricing assets and liabilities 
we base projected pricing for maturing and repricing assets and liabilities upon market interest rates and actual pricing experience over the period immediately preceding the projection period 
using the current level of market interest rates at december  and using actual pricing experience immediately preceding the projection  our simulation model projects a net interest margin of for the twelve month period ending december  this compares to a net interest margin of for the year ended december  assuming a basis point rise in rates over year end market levels  the net interest margin is projected to be for the month horizon 
the net interest margin is projected to be and for a and basis point rise in rates  respectively  over the same measurement period 
the net interest margin is projected to be and for a and basis point fall in rates  respectively 
our interest rate risk profile shows a fairly balanced position for both rising and falling rates 
our balance sheet as of december  was slightly asset sensitive 
the consensus blue chip economic forecast at december  called for rising short term rates over the next twelve months  with long term rates beyond years rising less than short term rates  which is commonly referred to as a flattening of the yield curve 
accordingly  we are closely monitoring the impact of both a rising rate environment and a flattening of the yield curve 
we also use a cumulative gap analysis model that seeks to measure the repricing differentials  or gap  between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time horizons 
the following table reflects the gap positions of our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and at various repricing intervals 
this gap analysis indicates that we had a relatively matched balance sheet over a one year time horizon at december   with rate sensitive assets amounting to of rate sensitive liabilities 
at december   our balance sheet was slightly asset sensitive over a one year time horizon  with rate sensitive assets amounting to of rate sensitive liabilities 
the projected deposit repricing volumes reflect adjustments based on management s assumptions of the expected rate sensitivity to current market rates for core deposits without contractual maturity ie  interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts 
adjustments are also made for callable investment securities in the bond portfolio to place these bonds in call date categories 
management believes that the current degree of interest rate risk is acceptable in the current interest rate environment

the first program is a blanket agreement for advances and security agreement with the fhlb  under which our subsidiaries have pledged residential first mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans and investments securities as collateral to secure available lines of credit 
the second program allows for advances under a warehouse line secured by our mortgage loans held for sale 
our correspondent bank line of credit is with the bankers bank in atlanta  georgia 
the line is secured with the common stock of security bank of bibb county and indirectly the stock of fairfield financial as its subsidiary and security bank of houston county and is primarily used to provide capital injections to the subsidiaries 
the million of subordinated debentures above relate to our december offering of trust preferred securities  the proceeds of which were used to retire holding company debt and to fund our acquisition of security bank of jones county 
other bank facilities are leased under operating leases included in the table above 
deferred compensation plans are maintained by two of our subsidiary banks 
these plans are for specific officers to defer current compensation until termination  retirement  death or an unforeseeable emergency 
the contracts were initially funded through the purchase of life insurance policies 
off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by a bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
a commitment involves  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the instrument is represented by the contractual notional amount of the instrument 
because certain commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral held for commitments to extend credit varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant  equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
the following table summarizes our off balance sheet financial instruments whose contract amounts represented credit risk as of december  financial and performance letters of credit million unfulfilled loan commitments million no losses are anticipated as a result of the commitments and we do not feel that they are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition 
inflation inflation impacts our financial condition and operating results 
however  because most of the assets of the bank subsidiaries are monetary in nature  the effect is less significant compared to other commercial or industrial companies with heavy investments in inventories and fixed assets 
inflation influences the growth of total banking assets  which in turn produces a need for an increased equity capital base to support growing banks 
inflation also influences interest rates and tends to raise the general level of salaries  operating costs and purchased services 
our mortgage division is particularly impacted by swings in the interest rate cycle 
we have not attempted to measure the effect of inflation on various types of income and expense due to difficulties in quantifying the impact 
management s awareness of inflationary effects has led to various operational strategies to cope with its impact 
we engage in various asset liability management strategies to control interest rate sensitivity and minimize exposure to interest rate risk 
prices for banking products and services are continually reviewed in relation to current costs  and overhead cost cutting is an ongoing task
