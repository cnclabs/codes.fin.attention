item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cohu s primary business activity involves the development  manufacture  marketing  sale and servicing of test handling equipment for the global semiconductor industry 
the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
shifts in the semiconductor market  electronics and computer industries and telecommunications markets  as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions  have had and will have significant impacts on our businesses 
during the three year period ended december   the semiconductor equipment industry experienced a severe business downturn 
our net sales during this period declined more than from our record year in this decrease in revenue was generally comparable to most other companies in the semiconductor equipment industry  particularly the back end semiconductor equipment companies that would be considered the closest to cohu in terms of business cycles 
in the first six months of  cohu s semiconductor equipment business  as well as the semiconductor equipment industry generally  saw significantly improved order bookings and backlog  an indication that the severe three year industry downturn had possibly ended 
additionally  our operating results improved during the period in part due to improved sales product mix resulting in a higher gross margin 
however  our orders declined in the second half of and business conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry have again weakened 
the length and severity of the current industry downturn is not currently known 
our operating results in the last three years have been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues 
these charges totaled approximately million during the three year period ended december  approximately million for the year ended december  and were primarily the result of decreases in customer forecasts  competitive conditions in the test handler industry and  to a lesser extent  changes in our sales product mix as a result of new product introductions 
exposures related to inventories are common in the semiconductor equipment industry due to the narrow customer base  the custom nature of the products and inventory and the shortened product life cycles caused by rapid changes in semiconductor manufacturing technology 
increased competition  particularly in the last several years  has also negatively impacted our gross margins on certain products and we believe it is likely these conditions will exist for the foreseeable future 
our other operating costs consist of research and development r d and selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
both r d and sg a expense increased in  due to increased business volume and investment in development programs 
our non semiconductor equipment businesses have comprised approximately of our revenues during the last three years 
during we saw improved results within our television camera and metal detection businesses 
the results of our microwave communications business continued to deteriorate  primarily due to revenue deferrals associated with a contract with the united arab emirates 
our financial condition is very strong with significant cash and short term investments and no long term debt 
during the three year period ended december  we generated million of net cash from operating activities and total cash and investments have increased from million at december  to million at december  cohu management uses several performance metrics to manage our various businesses 
these metrics  which tend to focus on near term forecasts due to the limited order backlog in our businesses  include i order bookings and backlog for the most recently completed quarter and the forecast for the next quarter  ii inventory levels and related excess exposures typically based on the next twelve month s forecast  iii gross margin and other operating expense trends and iv industry data and trends noted in various publicly released sources 
due to the short term nature of our order backlog that historically has represented about three months of business and the inherent volatility of the semiconductor equipment business  our past performance is frequently not indicative of future operating results or cash flows 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates cohu s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon cohu s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires cohu to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  cohu evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation 
cohu bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
cohu believes the following critical accounting policies  that are more fully described in the cohu consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition cohu generally recognizes revenue upon shipment and title passage for established products ie  those that have previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements that provide for full payment tied to shipment 
revenue for products that have not previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements or from sales where customer payment dates are not determinable is recognized upon customer acceptance 
accounts receivable cohu maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of cohu s customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty cohu provides for the estimated costs of product warranties in the period sales are recognized 
cohu s warranty obligation estimates are affected by historical product shipment levels  product performance and material and labor costs incurred in correcting product performance problems 
should product performance  material usage or labor repair costs differ from cohu s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory cohu records valuation reserves on its inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product demand  market conditions and product selling prices 
if future product demand  market conditions or product selling prices are less or more favorable than those projected by management or if continued modifications to products are required to meet specifications or other customer requirements  changes to inventory reserves may be required 
income taxes cohu estimates income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
establishing  reducing or increasing a valuation allowance in an accounting period results in an increase or decrease in tax expense in the statement of operations 
cohu must make significant judgments to determine the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against net deferred tax assets 
our gross deferred tax asset balance as of december  was million  with a valuation allowance of million 
we recorded the valuation allowance in the fourth quarters of and as a result of our recent losses and to reflect uncertainties concerning our ability to generate future taxable income and our corresponding ability to utilize our deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets consist primarily of deductible temporary differences  tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
intangible assets at december   intangible assets other than goodwill were evaluated for impairment using undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets as required by fasb sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and we concluded there was no impairment loss 
cohu is required 
table of contents to assess goodwill impairment using the methodology prescribed by fasb sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the required annual goodwill impairment test is performed as of october of each year 
cohu did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test 
contingencies cohu is subject to certain contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of its businesses 
in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we assess the likelihood that future events will confirm the existence of a loss or an impairment of an asset 
if a loss or asset impairment is probable  as defined in sfas no 
and the amount of the loss or impairment is reasonably estimable  we accrue a charge to operations in the period such conditions become known

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the three year period ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative income loss from operations compared to net sales our net sales increased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor test handling equipment in increased from the period and accounted for of consolidated net sales in  versus in the primary reason for the increase in sales of semiconductor equipment was an increase in customer demand for our products as the semiconductor industry experienced strong business conditions during the first six months of sales of television cameras and other equipment accounted for of net sales in and increased when compared to  while the combined sales of metal detection and microwave equipment increased from the increase in demand for our other  non semiconductor equipment products can be attributed to increased sales of our products to the us government and greater demand for security related products during at december   we had deferred revenue totaling approximately million and deferred profit of million 
at december   we had deferred revenue totaling approximately million and deferred profit of million 
the increase in deferred revenue is primarily the result of additional revenue deferrals associated with bms contract with the united arab emirates and delta s semiconductor equipment 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in during our gross margin was favorably impacted by improved product mix  increased business volume and manufacturing efficiencies 
our gross margin was also favorably impacted by million from the sale of inventory which had previously been written down and the elimination of million in accrued sales credits 
for further details see note to the consolidated financial statements in item in both and  our gross margin was negatively impacted by charges to cost of sales for excess and obsolete inventory 
cohu computes the majority of its excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one year inventory usage forecast 
during and  we recorded charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of declines in customer forecasts for certain products  lower of cost or market inventory writedowns and other business issues that negatively impacted our forecasted inventory usage 
while we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns are adequate to cover our known exposures at december   reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products  including our recently introduced delta edge handler  as a result of our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements  will result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our gross margin in future periods 
conversely  if our actual inventory usage is greater than our forecasted usage  our gross margin in future periods may be favorably impacted 

table of contents research and development expense r d as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in  to million in the increase in r d was primarily the result of increased r d material and labor costs for product development in our semiconductor equipment and television camera businesses 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  from in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in to million in the increase in sg a was due to  among other things  increased business volume  higher incentive compensation expenses and additional compliance costs associated with the sarbanes oxley act of interest income interest income was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates in income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pretax income loss was in and in the provision benefit for income taxes differs from the u 
s federal statutory rate primarily due to tax credits  export sales benefits  changes in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and settlement of prior period tax returns and adjustments to prior year tax accruals 
for further details see note to the consolidated financial statements in item in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance of million and million has been provided on deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable was determined based on i taxable income in prior carryback years  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  iii tax planning strategies and iv future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in evaluating future taxable income for valuation allowance purposes at december   the company concluded that it was only appropriate to consider income expected to be generated in while cohu has had a long history of profitability  we incurred losses in each of the three years prior to and were in a three year cumulative loss position entering business conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry improved during the first half of and our operating results benefited from these improved conditions 
however  the industry weakened considerably in the last six months of and the near term outlook is uncertain 
anticipating income for cohu beyond involves substantial risk and a reliable forecast of such income was not possible  and as a result  the company believed such income could not be relied upon to support deferred tax assets under the more likely than not realization requirement in sfas no 
in  we will continue to assess the assumptions used to calculate the valuation allowance at december  the company may be required to adjust the allowance  if  based on estimates of future income  the company concludes that all or a portion of the valuation allowance is no longer warranted 
a reduction in the valuation allowance would result in a corresponding credit to income tax expense in the period the allowance is reduced 
conversely  an increase in the valuation allowance would increase income tax expense 
the internal revenue service irs is currently conducting a routine examination of cohu s consolidated tax returns for the period through the examination field work was substantially completed in october  and the results are currently under final review by the joint committee on taxation 
the company expects a final decision on the examination in early any adjustments that result from the irs examination will be reflected in the company s results of operations 
the company believes that such adjustments  if any  are adequately provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
a favorable outcome from the examination will result in a credit to income tax expense and a corresponding increase in net income and net income per share in the period the examination is finalized 

table of contents the company has derived significant tax benefits from the research credit under section of the internal revenue code and the extraterritorial income exclusion eti 
recent legislation  the american jobs creation act of  the act  repeals the eti regime for transactions entered into after december  subject to a phase out that would allow the company to claim full eti benefits in  of the benefits in and in other legislation extended the research credit through december  the act created a deduction for domestic manufacturing activities  with a phased in rate beginning in it is not currently known the extent to which the company will benefit from the domestic manufacturing deduction in future years and whether the provision could partly or entirely replace the lost eti benefit 
other items on april   cohu announced that its delta design subsidiary was relocating its littleton  massachusetts operation to its headquarters facility in poway  california 
we recorded charges to operations in the years ended december  and totaling approximately million and million  respectively  for severance and other related exit costs 
in december   cohu invested million in kryotech  inc preferred stock 
in june   we wrote off the investment and recorded a million charge as the investment was deemed impaired and such impairment was considered other than temporary  under the guidelines of apb no 
in april   cohu s delta design subsidiary completed the relocation of its columbus  ohio operations to its headquarters facility in poway  california 
cohu recorded charges to operations in the year ended december   totaling million for severance and one time termination benefits and other related exit costs 
this relocation was completed in and we did not record any additional charges during on april   cohu sold twelve acres of land in poway  california held for future development for million in net cash proceeds resulting in a pretax gain of approximately million 
in april  cohu  through its broadcast microwave services subsidiary  was awarded an million contract from the united arab emirates uae armed services to provide microwave communications equipment for a command center and infrastructure system for border security 
the contract  which utilizes our most advanced microwave communications technology that has not previously been installed in an application of this size and complexity  requires that of the total contract price be paid after the system has been fully accepted by the customer 
as a result of these factors and the inability to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion and acceptance  cohu will recognize all revenue and related costs under this contract in the period the system is accepted by the customer 
through december   we had shipped inventory with a sales value of million and deferred costs of approximately million resulting in deferred profit of approximately million under the contract 
in addition  at december  we had inventory to be delivered under the contract of approximately million and related accounts receivable of approximately million 
cohu has also provided the customer with a standby letter of credit totaling approximately million at december   that may be drawn upon if bms does not fulfill the terms of the contract 
we currently expect equipment and system installation to be completed in if bms is unable to obtain customer acceptance of the system  the related inventory and receivables may need to be written off  the customer might seek a refund of the million in payments made to bms under the contract and our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially impacted 
as a result of the factors set forth above  our net income was million in compared to a net loss of  in 
table of contents compared to net sales our net sales increased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor test handling equipment in increased from the period and accounted for of consolidated net sales in  versus in sales of television cameras and other equipment accounted for of net sales in and decreased when compared to  while the combined sales of metal detection and microwave equipment decreased from gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in  primarily as a result of changes in product mix  intangible asset amortization expense totaling million in and increased charges to cost of sales 
cohu computes the majority of its excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one year inventory usage forecast 
during and  we recorded charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of declines in customer forecasts for certain products  lower of cost or market inventory write downs and other business issues that negatively impacted our forecasted inventory usage 
research and development expense r d as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  decreasing in absolute dollars from million in  to million in the decrease in r d was primarily the result of lower r d material and labor costs for product development in the semiconductor equipment business resulting  in part  from the closure of our facility in columbus  ohio 
in addition  in r d expense included million of intangible asset amortization 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a as a percentage of net sales increased to in  from in  increasing from million in to million in the increase in sg a was due to  among other things  a slight increase in business volume and higher insurance costs 
interest income interest income was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates in income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pretax income loss was in and in the provision benefit for income taxes differs from the u 
s federal statutory rate primarily due to tax credits  export sales benefits  changes in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and settlement of prior period tax returns and adjustments to prior year tax accruals 
as a result of factors set forth above  our net loss was  in compared to a net loss of million in liquidity and capital resources our net cash flows provided from operating activities in the year ended december  totaled million 
the major components of cash flows provided by operating activities were net income of million  offset by the net change in current assets and liabilities and depreciation and amortization of million 
the net change in current assets and liabilities included increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively 
these increases were primarily attributable to the improved business conditions in the semiconductor equipment business that drove higher sales and order activity during net cash provided by investing activities included million from the sales and maturities of short term investments  less purchases of short term investments  and purchases of property  plant and equipment and other assets of million offset by a million payment 
table of contents received on a note receivable 
the purchases of property  plant and equipment were primarily made to support activities in the semiconductor equipment business and consisted primarily of software and equipment used in engineering  manufacturing and other related functions 
cash used for financing activities included million received from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options offset by million for the payment of dividends 
the company maintains a  unsecured bank line of credit bearing interest at the bank s prime rate 
the line of credit expires in july  and requires us to maintain specified minimum levels of net worth  limits the amount of capital expenditures and to meet certain other financial covenants 
we are currently in compliance with these covenants 
no borrowings were outstanding at december   however   of the credit facility was allocated to standby letters of credit at december   leaving the balance of  available 
we expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and we anticipate that present working capital and available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  fiscal year total in thousands non cancelable operating leases purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within relatively short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next three months 
off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  cohu provides standby letters of credit instruments to certain parties as required 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments that cohu could be required to make under these standby letters of credit was approximately million 
cohu has not recorded any liability in connection with these arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
cohu does not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements 
trends  risks and uncertainties the semiconductor industry we serve is highly volatile and unpredictable 
visibility into our markets is limited 
cohu s operating results are substantially dependent on our semiconductor equipment business 
this capital equipment business is in turn highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity  which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment  including equipment of the type manufactured and marketed by cohu 
we anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns  such as those experienced in  and late  continuing throughout   and during the third and fourth quarters of any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor 
table of contents equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write offs and reserve requirements 
in the years ended december    and  we recorded pretax inventory related charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts 
a limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales 
a relatively small number of customers historically have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales 
in the year ended december   two customers of the semiconductor equipment segment accounted for in  and in of our net sales 
during the past five years  the percentage of cohu s sales derived from each of these and other significant customers has varied greatly 
such variations are due to changes in the customer s business and their purchase of products from our competitors 
it is common in the semiconductor test handler industry for customers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier  increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate 
no assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers 
furthermore  we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products  market conditions  outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors  would adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers may cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results 
the semiconductor equipment industry in general and the test handler market in particular  is highly competitive 
the semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world 
the test handler industry  while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry  has an inordinately large number of participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures 
future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers 
the japanese and korean markets for test handling equipment are large and represent a significant percentage of the worldwide market 
during the last five years we have had only limited sales to japanese and korean customers who have historically purchased test handling equipment from asian suppliers 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and customer support capabilities and offer more extensive product offerings than cohu 
in addition  there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete favorably against those of cohu 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities 
our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner  the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages  or disputes over rights of cohu or our competitors to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of  or margins on our existing products 
we believe that competitive conditions in the semiconductor test handler market have intensified over the last several years 
this intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products 
if we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products we expect these competitive conditions to negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future 
semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change  product introductions and transitions may result in inventory write offs and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities 
we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully  as introductions of new products  including our recently introduced delta edge handler  may adversely impact sales and or margins of existing products 
in addition  the introduction of new products by cohu or by our competitors  the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers  the migration to new semiconductor test handling methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete  resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory 
table of contents exposure 
this increased exposure resulted in significant charges to operations during each of the years in the three year period ended december  future inventory write offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
the design  development  commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor test handling equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties 
these risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements  integration of the test handler with other suppliers equipment and the customers manufacturing processes  transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins 
the design and development of new test handling equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly  test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes 
we believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating 
as a result of these changes and other factors  assessing the market potential and commercial viability of new integrated circuit test handling equipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk 
in addition  not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes 
differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard semiconductor test handler products that are capable of achieving broad market acceptance 
as a result  we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry s future test handler requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance 
failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test handler products may have a material adverse impact on our operations  financial condition and results of operations 
the transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common 
we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new test handlers 
in addition  as is common with semiconductor equipment  our after sale support and warranty costs have been significantly higher with new test handlers than with our established products 
future technologies  processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop  introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance 
furthermore  we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products 
we are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and investments 
cohu has made  and may in the future make  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses with complementary products  services and or technologies 
in july  cohu acquired the assets of the automated systems business from schlumberger technologies  inc for million in cash 
a significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of  cohu invested million in kryotech  inc preferred stock  that was written off in june   and million in intangible assets for certain technology 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired businesses  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses  lack of synergy  or the inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  failure to commercialize purchased technology  and the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods 
in addition  such acquisitions or investments may result in immediate charges to operating results 
mergers  acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect cohu s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we have taken remedial measures to address previous slowdowns in the semiconductor equipment industry that may affect our ability to be competitive 
in the past  we have taken remedial measures to address the slowdown in the market for our products 
in particular  we reduced our workforce  including reductions in september and october  january and march  delayed salary increases  reduced senior executives pay  implemented furloughs  reduced expense budgets and announced facility consolidations including delta design s columbus  ohio and littleton  massachusetts operations into our poway  california facility 
each of these measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products and making it more difficult for us to respond to customers needs 
our backlog is limited and may not accurately reflect future business activity 
our order backlog has historically represented approximately three months of revenue and as a result our visibility of future business activity is limited 
due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules  cancellation of orders  potential delays in product shipments  difficulties in obtaining inventory parts from suppliers  failure to satisfy customer acceptance requirements and the inability to recognize revenue under accounting requirements  our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of sales in any future period 
furthermore  all orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited penalty 
a reduction in backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  backlog at december   may not be a reliable indicator of revenues in future periods due to delayed delivery dates or customer requested changes to delivery schedules  order cancellations and delays in recognizing revenue due to accounting requirements 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees  operations and infrastructure 
the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes in demand for its products 
changes in product demand result from a number of factors including the semiconductor industry s continually changing and unpredictable capacity requirements and changes in ic design and packaging 
sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment have a significant impact on our operations 
in response to a severe industry downturn in  we reduced our total workforce by approximately 
during  we increased our workforce by more than as business conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry and our order backlog improved 
in  we reduced our workforce approximately as a result of a downturn in the semiconductor equipment industry 
workforce reductions continued in the third and fourth quarter of  january and march  we recently consolidated delta design s columbus  ohio and littleton  massachusetts operations into our poway  california facility 
in we increased our workforce  particularly in manufacturing  to meet increased demand 
however  our orders declined significantly in the third quarter of and business conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry have weakened and as a result workforce reductions may be required 
such radical changes in workforce levels place enormous demands on our employees  operations and infrastructure since newly hired personnel rarely possess the expertise and level of experience of current employees 
additionally  these transitions divert management time and attention from other activities and adversely impact employee morale 
we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties  particularly in manufacturing  in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce 
the volatility in headcount and business levels  combined with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
we may not be able to successfully adjust our systems  facilities and production capacity to meet our customers changing requirements 
the inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we have experienced a significant decline in gravity feed test handler sales to dram customers 
sales of gravity feed test handlers used in dram testing represented a significant percentage of cohu s total semiconductor equipment related revenue during the period through due to changes in semiconductor package technology  gravity feed handlers are no longer suitable for handling many types of drams 
as a result  we 
table of contents have seen a significant decline in sales of our gravity feed test handler products 
pick and place handlers used in dram applications account for a significant portion of the worldwide test handler market and cohu s market share in the dram segment is negligible 
cohu s share of the gravity feed handler market for the last five years has also been negligible  and with the announced closure of our littleton  massachusetts operations  we no longer plan to sell gravity feed test handlers 
such handlers are used in numerous non dram applications and continue to represent a significant portion of the worldwide test handler market 
because we do not participate in the dram and or gravity feed market segments  our total available sales market is limited and  as a result  our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business 
we are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries around the world to support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and  as such  we face risks in doing business abroad that we do not face domestically 
certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results  including costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights  longer payment cycles  local political and economic conditions  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which can affect demand and increase our costs 
additionally  managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure  communications and information technology  inventory control  customer relationship management  terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities 
if we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost effective manner could adversely impact our operations 
we use numerous vendors to supply parts  components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products 
it is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts  components and subassemblies 
as a result  certain key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products 
on occasion  cohu has experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key suppliers 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts 
we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interest of the stockholders 
our dividend policy may be affected by  among other items  our views on potential future capital requirements  including those related to research and development  creation and expansion of sales distribution channels  investments and acquisitions  legal risks and stock repurchases 
third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights 
cohu relies on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products 
any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patent life  or be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and these rights may cease to provide significant competitive advantages 
in addition  from time to time  we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims 
any such claims  with or without merit  could 
table of contents be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause cohu to incur significant expenses 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against cohu and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non infringing technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
a majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries  primarily in asia  that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of asian test handling equipment suppliers 
during the year ended december   of our total net sales were exported to foreign countries  including of the sales in the semiconductor equipment segment 
the majority of our export sales are made to destinations in asia 
political or economic instability  particularly in asia  may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment  including equipment of the type manufactured and marketed by cohu 
in addition  we face intense competition from a number of asian suppliers that have certain advantages over us suppliers  including cohu 
these advantages include  among other things  proximity to customers  favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations 
in addition  changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers 
the loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business 
certain key personnel are critical to our business 
our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel  many of whom are not bound by employment or non competition agreements 
our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  manufacturing  technical  engineering  marketing  sales and support personnel 
competition for qualified personnel  particularly those with technical skills  is intense  and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel 
there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees  by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position  or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees 
our non semiconductor equipment businesses have experienced little or no growth 
we develop  manufacture and sell products used in closed circuit television  metal detection and microwave communications applications 
these products are sold in highly competitive markets and many competitors are segments of large  diversified companies with substantially greater financial  engineering  marketing  manufacturing and customer support capabilities than cohu 
in addition  there are smaller companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete favorably against those of cohu 
we have seen a significant decline in the operating results of these businesses over the last several years with increasing losses and the future prospects for certain of these businesses remain uncertain 
we may not be able to continue to compete successfully in these businesses 
new accounting rules will impact our future operating results 
a change in accounting standards or a change in existing taxation rules can have a significant effect on our reported results 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
these new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  under the newly issued sfas no 
r we will be required to account for equity under our stock plans as a compensation expense and our net income and net income per share will be significantly reduced 
currently  we calculate compensation expense and disclose the impact on net income loss and net income loss per share  as well as the impact of all stock based compensation expense in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r requires cohu to adopt the new accounting provisions beginning in our third quarter of  and will require cohu to expense share based payment awards given to employees  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans and stock options  as compensation cost 

table of contents our financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts estimates  which may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we do not currently provide estimates of our revenues or results of operations for future periods 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to timing of orders from customers and shipments to customers  inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements  impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the price of our products in international locations  inventory writedowns  and inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers 
due to these factors or other unanticipated events  quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance 
in addition  from time to time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors generally 
this could cause the market price of our securities to decline  perhaps significantly 
we have experienced significant volatility in our stock price 
a variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile 
in recent years  the stock market in general  and the market for shares of high technology companies in particular  including ours  have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
during the last three years the price of our common stock has ranged from to 
the price of our stock may be more volatile than other companies due to  among other factors  the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  our significant customer concentration  intense competition in the test handler industry  our limited backlog making earnings predictability difficult and our relatively low daily stock trading volume 
the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance 
recently enacted and future changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  are creating challenges for publicly held companies including cohu 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
in addition  it has become more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
further  our board members  chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which could harm our business 
the occurrence of natural disasters in asia and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and threats may adversely impact our operations and sales 
our asian sales and service headquarters is located in singapore and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in asia 
in addition  we have a location in the philippines which fabricates certain component parts used in our semiconductor test handlers 
these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  tsunamis  fires  and floods  which at times have disrupted the local economies 
a significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results 
we are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this 
table of contents kind  and do not presently have redundant  multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster 
in the event of such disaster  our business would suffer 
furthermore  cohu s broadcast microwave services subsidiary is currently involved in a significant contract with the united arab emirates 
continued terrorist attacks or threats in this region may cause geopolitical instability that may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully satisfy customer acceptance requirements under the agreement  which would materially impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at december   our investment portfolio included short term  fixed income investment securities with a fair value of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates eg to would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars and as a result we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
monetary assets and liabilities of cohu s foreign operations are not significant 
the effect of an immediate ten percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
