item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview the company is a leading  vertically integrated international producer and marketer of value added  metal based specialty chemicals and related materials  primarily from cobalt and nickel 
the company applies proprietary technology to unrefined cobalt and nickel raw materials to market more than  different product offerings to approximately  customers in over industries 
the company operates in two business segments cobalt and nickel 
the company s business is critically connected to both the price and availability of raw materials 
the primary raw materials used by the company are cobalt and nickel  and the cost of these raw materials fluctuates due to actual or perceived changes in supply and demand  changes in cobalt and nickel reference prices and changes in availability from suppliers 
fluctuations in the prices of cobalt and nickel have been significant in the past and the company believes that cobalt and nickel price fluctuations are likely to continue in the future 
the company attempts to mitigate changes in prices and availability by maintaining adequate inventory levels and long term supply relationships with a variety of producers 
generally  the company is able to pass through to its customers increases and decreases in raw material prices by increasing or decreasing  respectively  the prices of its products 
the degree of profitability of the company principally depends on the company s ability to maintain the differential between its product prices and product costs 
during periods of rapidly changing metal prices  however  there may be price lags that can impact the short term profitability of the company both positively and negatively 
reductions in the price of raw materials or declines in the selling price of the company s finished goods could also result in the company s inventory carrying value being written down to a lower market value  or result in a reduction in its gross profit from historical levels 
the company has manufacturing and other facilities in north america  africa  europe and asia pacific  and markets its products worldwide 
although most of the company s raw material purchases and product sales are based on the us dollar  prices of certain raw materials  liabilities for non us operating expenses and income taxes are denominated in local currencies 
as such  in periods when certain currencies particularly the euro strengthen against the us dollar  the company s results of operations are negatively impacted 
in addition  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products provided by the company in foreign markets where payments for its products are made in local currency 
accordingly  fluctuations in currency prices affect the company s operating results

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made their best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements related to the critical accounting policies described below 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when unaffiliated customers take title and assume ownership of products specified in their purchase agreements  which generally occurs upon shipment of product or usage of consignment inventories 
inventories the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
the cost of the company s raw materials fluctuates due to actual or perceived changes in supply and demand of raw materials  changes in cobalt and nickel reference prices and changes in availability from suppliers 
in periods of raw material metal price declines or declines in the selling prices of the company s finished products  inventory carrying values may exceed the amount the company could realize on sale  resulting in a lower of cost or market charge 
monthly  the company evaluates the need for a lower of cost or market adjustment to inventories based on the end of the month market price 
long lived assets goodwill must be reviewed at least annually for impairment  in accordance with a specified methodology 
further  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company generally invests in long lived assets to secure raw material feedstocks  produce new products  or increase production capacity or capability 
because market conditions may change  future cash flows may be difficult to forecast 
furthermore  the assets and related businesses may be in different stages of development 
if the company determined that the future undiscounted cash flows from these investments were not expected to exceed the carrying value of the investments  the company would record an impairment charge 
however  determining future cash flows is subject to estimates and different estimates could yield different results 
additionally  other changes in the estimates and assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term growth rate  which drive the valuation techniques employed to estimate the future cash flows of the these investments  could change and  therefore  impact the analysis of impairment in the future 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries  to the extent such earnings are determined to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time 
the company has significant operations outside the united states  where most of its pre tax earnings are derived  and in jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is lower than in the united states 
the company also has significant cash requirements in the united states to pay interest and principal on borrowings 
as a result  significant tax and treasury planning and analysis of future operations are necessary to determine the proper amounts of tax assets  liabilities  and tax expense 
the company s tax assets  liabilities  and tax expense are supported by its best estimates and assumptions of its global cash requirements  planned dividend repatriations  and expectations of future earnings 
where the company has determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance has been established 
the existing valuation allowance pertains to the deferred tax assets resulting principally from net operating loss carryforwards in the united states

the company has certain derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges 
for these hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss from the financial instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity and subsequently reclassified to results of operations when the hedged item affects results of operations 
any ineffective portions of the cash flow hedges are recognized immediately in results of operations 
the gain or loss related to financial instruments that are not designated as hedges are recognized immediately in results of operations 
these instruments are entered into to economically hedge certain movements in metal prices 
during  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that are designated as fair value hedges 
for these hedges  changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in earnings as equal and offsetting gains and losses in the interest expense component of the statement of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financing activities  is exposed to changes in metal prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company manages exposures to changes in metal prices  interest rates and  at times  foreign currency exchange rates through its regular operating and financing activities  which include the use of derivative instruments 
the primary raw materials used by the company in manufacturing its products are cobalt and nickel 
the company s supply of cobalt has historically been sourced from the democratic republic of congo drc  australia and finland 
although the company has never experienced a significant shortage of cobalt raw material  production problems and political and civil instability in certain supplier countries may in the future affect the supply and market price of cobalt raw materials 
nickel historically has been sourced from australia  finland and brazil 
the company does not anticipate any substantial interruption in its raw materials supply that would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  however  a significant long term nickel contract expired in may  and there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain as much nickel from other sources as would be necessary to satisfy the company s requirements or at prices comparable to its current arrangements 
however  the company is actively pursuing a variety of feed sources to ensure that the company does not experience any material shortage of nickel over the next several years 
the company also attempts to mitigate changes in prices and availability by maintaining adequate inventory levels and long term supply relationships with a variety of producers 
the cost of raw materials fluctuates due to both actual and perceived changes in supply and demand of raw materials  changes in cobalt reference prices and nickel lme market prices and changes in availability from suppliers 
generally  the company is able to pass through to its customers increases and decreases in raw material prices by increasing or decreasing  respectively  the prices of its products 
the degree of profitability of the company principally depends on the company s ability to maintain the differential between its product prices and product costs 
during periods of rapidly changing metal prices  however  there may be price lags that can impact the short term profitability of the company both positively and negatively 
reductions in the price of raw materials or the selling prices of the company s finished products could also result in the company s inventory carrying value being written down to a lower market value  or result in a reduction in its gross profit from historical levels 
the company also undertakes to minimize the effect on profitability of changes in the market price of nickel through hedging activities 
the company enters into forward contracts to hedge the purchase of nickel raw material and the sale of nickel products 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company predominantly utilizes us dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of the company s borrowings are in fixed rate instruments 
the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the fixed rate instruments to variable rate contracts 
there is an inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements see note g to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report
