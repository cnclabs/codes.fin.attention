comparison of fiscal years ended december   and revenue 
we derive our revenue from the various consulting services that we provide which are grouped under service lines entitled competition management and performance assurance 
revenue decreased million  or to million for the year ended  compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
the decrease was caused by some of our existing programs under our performance assurance services which reached a level of maturation in which our services are coming to a conclusion 
in addition  the decrease was due to delays by the federal government to issue planned requests for proposals rfp  which affected our competition management revenue  and delays in the start up of some awarded programs  which affected our performance assurance revenues 
these delays were caused by the funding required to fight the war on terror in iraq and afghanistan  election year uncertainties  and nasa s reprioritization 
we have traditionally been heavily concentrated in the aerospace and defense sector which leaves us susceptible to market fluctuations caused by events such as the war on terrorism and election year uncertainties 
in we initiated a strategic goal of diversifying ourselves outside of our traditional aerospace and defense concentration by offering our services to new customers in new verticals 
our efforts have produced strong results

the increase in revenues from our top five customers grew to million compared to million in the prior year 
our remaining customer base revenues increased to million compared to million in the prior year 
this increase in growth is directly related to our hiring of more account executives which enabled us to penetrate deeper into our existing customer base and focus on developing other vertical markets 
we successfully continued to diversify our customer base by adding fifteen new customers in which reduced our overall percentage of customers in the aerospace and defense industry

the increase in gross margin dollars was directly related to the increase in our revenues 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased to for the year ended compared to for the same period of the prior year

in this regard  in october  we entered into negotiations to  among other things  amend selected sections of the stock purchase and sale agreement with l communications corporation related to the disposition of emergent east 
the resulting amendment to that agreement allowed us to realize an immediate additional net tax benefit under the act of  discontinued operations refer to note of the attached consolidated financial statements

the company intends to repurchase shares from time to time  at prevailing prices  in the open market 
the timing and amount of the share repurchases will be at the discretion of management and will be based on such factors as the stock price  general economic and market conditions  and other factors 
the share repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
shares repurchased under the plan will be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares 
as of december   we have repurchased  shares at a total cost of million 
in april  the company renewed its previous revolving credit agreement 
the renewed agreement allows for borrowings up to million at the prime rate minus one half of one percent per annum or libor plus two and one quarter percent per annum 
the new revolving credit agreement expires in april borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are unsecured 
the agreement requires the company to comply with certain financial covenants pertaining to its tangible net worth  ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  and ratio of current assets to current liabilities as defined in the agreement 
the agreement also contains certain negative covenants which  among other things  restrict the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness of more than million in excess of the million limit set forth in the credit agreement and make capital expenditures in excess of million without the prior written approval of the lender 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit  the bank had issued a letter of credit for  which expires on october   and we had million in availability 
our contractual obligations are as follows at december  contractual obligations payments due by period year after in thousands total or less years years years operating leases operating leases related to discontinued operations  net of subleases total operating leases related to discontinued operations represent office space previously occupied by the emergent east and emergent central divisions 
the amounts above represent the remaining lease commitments over the remaining terms of the leases 
we have entered into subleases for two of our leased properties 
these subleases cover a portion of our lease commitments for these properties  and we expect these subleases to continue in effect for the life of our lease obligations with respect to these properties 
we are continuing the process of identifying sub lessees for our remaining leased property or negotiating lease buy outs with the lessors 
we believe working capital available under the line of credit that expires in april  cash and cash equivalents on hand  and cash generated by continuing operations will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
we believe we will be able to extend or replace the line of credit when it expires 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
those estimates are based on our experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the majority of our services are provided under time and expenses billing arrangements  and revenue is recognized on the basis of hours worked  plus other reimbursable contract costs incurred during the period 
revenue is directly related to the total number of hours billed to clients and the associated hourly billing rates 
a limited amount of revenue is also derived from success fees  offered to clients as a pricing option  and recorded as revenue only upon attainment of the specified incentive criteria 
success fees are not billable and revenue is not recorded until the client wins a contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of potential future uncollectible accounts receivable related to current period revenue 
management exercises its best business judgment and reasonable assumptions and estimates in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period dependent upon the best business judgment and reasonable estimates invoked by management in calculating these rent estimates 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  recently issued financial accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which is a revision to sfas and supersedes apb and sfas this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
as of the required effective date  all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under statement will apply this statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards  for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under statement for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  those entities may elect to apply a modified version of the retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by statement as a result  beginning in the third quarter of  the company will adopt sfas r and begin reflecting the stock option expense determined under fair value based methods in its statement of operations rather than as pro forma disclosure in the notes to the financial statements 
the company has not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas and it is evaluating the requirements under sfas r 
such adoption may have a substantial impact on its consolidated statements of operations and earnings per share
