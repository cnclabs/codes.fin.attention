overview arbitron is an international media and marketing research firm primarily serving radio  cable television  advertising agencies  advertisers  outdoor and out of home media and  through its scarborough joint venture  broadcast television and print media 
arbitron currently has four main services measuring radio audiences in local markets in the united states and mexico  measuring national radio audiences and the audience size of network radio programs and commercials  providing application software used for accessing and analyzing media audience and marketing information data  and providing consumer and media usage information services to radio  cable television  advertising agencies  advertisers  retailers  outdoor and out of home media  online industries and  through its scarborough joint venture  broadcast television and print media 
arbitron s quantitative radio audience measurement business and related software sales accounted for approximately of its revenue for both and consolidation in the radio broadcasting industry has led to arbitron s dependence on a limited number of key customers 
in  clear channel communications  inc clear channel communications and infinity broadcasting corp 
infinity broadcasting represented approximately and  respectively  of arbitron s revenue 
arbitron s agreements with these customers are not exclusive and contain no renewal obligations 
in august  arbitron entered into license agreements with infinity broadcasting  effective april   to provide audience estimates  software and other ancillary services to infinity broadcasting s radio stations through the company s winter survey 
certain of clear channel communication s existing license agreements with arbitron were scheduled to expire on december  on december   the company entered into new license agreements with clear channel communications to provide radio ratings and software services for clear channel communication s radio stations and networks through the company s fall survey 
arbitron cannot give any assurances that it could replace the revenue that would be lost if a key customer failed to renew all or part of its agreements with arbitron 
the loss of a key customer would materially impact arbitron s business  financial position and operating results 
due to the slow economic growth of the radio industry as well as the high penetration of current services in the core radio station business  arbitron expects that its annual organic rate of revenue growth will be slower than historical trends for the foreseeable future 
arbitron entered into an agreement on may   with nielsen media research  inc nielsen media research  a provider of us television and cable audience measurement services  under which arbitron granted nielsen media research an option to join arbitron in the potential commercial deployment of the portable people meter portable people meter or ppm sm in the united states 
in the event nielsen media research exercises the option  the parties would form a joint venture to commercially deploy and operate the business of utilizing the portable people meter for the collection of listening and viewing audience data 
in  arbitron worked with nielsen media research on response rate issues and a variety of engineering tests 
in  arbitron reported on the outcomes of three collaborative tests of the ppm that were conducted with nielsen media research 
arbitron continues to work with nielsen media research to resolve outstanding issues and to negotiate business terms for a potential portable people meter joint venture 
in third quarter  arbitron began recruiting consumers to participate in a market demonstration to be conducted in houston  texas in and to confirm the results of previous tests and demonstrate enhancements to the portable people meter system that have been made since it was tested in philadelphia 
in addition  arbitron is participating in a portable people meter business impact study that is being led by the radio advertising bureau to research the impact on the radio industry of electronic measurement and a move from diaries to the portable people meter for radio audience measurement 
the study should be completed in as of january   bbm  the canadian industry cooperative for audience ratings  made the portable people meter the official ratings system for buying and selling commercial airtime on french language television in the markets of quebec and montreal 
separate from the proposed joint venture with nielsen media research  arbitron began testing additional marketing research applications of the portable people meter technology in one application that arbitron began testing was the use of the portable people meter as the media collection tool for a national marketing oriented panel designed to correlate advertising with shopping behavior and sales 
the objective is to provide multimedia exposure data combined with sales data from a single source to produce a measure of advertising effectiveness for advertisers  agencies and broadcasters 
on september   arbitron announced that arbitron and vnu  inc have agreed to jointly explore the development of a new national marketing research service which collects multi media and purchase information from a common sample of consumers 
procter gamble is also collaborating with the two companies to ensure that the service properly addresses the needs of marketers 
this would be a new type of service for which market acceptance is not yet known 
the continuing development and anticipated rollout of ppm services will require significant capital resources and will increase arbitron s operating costs over the next several years 
in the event arbitron decides to commercialize either a ppm ratings service or a ppm marketing application service  there could be significant start up expenses that could adversely affect arbitron s financial position and operating results 
arbitron uses listener diaries to gather radio listening data from sample households in the united states local markets for which it currently provides radio ratings 
a representative sample of the population in each local market is randomly selected for each survey and is recruited by telephone 
it is increasingly difficult and more costly to obtain consent from the phone sample to participate in the surveys and to get a usable diary returned to arbitron 
arbitron must achieve response rates sufficient to maintain confidence in its ratings  the support of the industry and accreditation by the media rating council 
response rates are a quality measure of survey performance and an important factor impacting costs associated with data collection 
overall response rates have declined over the past several years 
if response rates continue to decline further  arbitron s radio audience measurement business could be adversely affected 
arbitron commits extensive efforts and resources to address the decline of response rates 
additional initiatives in low response rate markets have had a positive impact on response rates  which have increased by approximately in those markets from the fall to the fall survey 
in addition  the response rate decline in all markets slowed significantly from the fall to the fall survey compared to the fall to the fall survey 
on march   arbitron acquired certain assets of marketing resources plus mrp from interactive market systems  inc  part of the vnu media measurement and information group  for million in cash 
mrp is a provider of media buying software systems to local and regional advertising agencies for broadcast and print media 
mrp develops  markets and supports a suite of software services used by approximately advertisers and advertising agencies across the united states 
on september   the company announced that its board of directors authorized a repurchase program under which the company could purchase up to million of its outstanding common stock through december  the company purchased the shares from time to time in either open market or private transactions at then prevailing market prices 
as of december   the company had repurchased an aggregate of  shares under the program for an aggregate purchase price of million 
arbitron announced on february  that its board of directors approved the payment of the company s first cash dividend of per common share 
the dividend will be paid on april  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march  critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are both important to the presentation of the company s financial position and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the company capitalizes software development costs with respect to major internal use software initiatives or enhancements 
the costs are capitalized from the time that the preliminary project stage is completed and management considers it probable that the software will be used to perform the function intended until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use 
once the software is placed in service  the capitalized costs are generally amortized over periods of three to five years 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of software may not be recovered  a recoverability analysis is performed based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the software in the future 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the software cost is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment is recognized 
the company s estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and management s assessments change 
as of december  and  the company s capitalized software developed for internal use had a carrying amount of million and million  respectively  including million and million  respectively  of portable people meter software 
arbitron uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the current provision for income taxes and also deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause actual income tax obligations to differ from estimates  thus materially impacting arbitron s financial position and results of operations 
certain reserves for tax contingencies were reversed in the third quarter of due to guidance in an internal revenue service revenue procedure 
also in the third quarter of  the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards was reduced due to higher actual and projected taxable income in the applicable states 
the net benefit of these changes was million in results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  the following table sets forth information with respect to the consolidated statements of income of arbitron for the years ended december  and consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands  except per share amounts percentage of increase decrease revenue dollars percent revenue costs and expenses cost of revenue selling  general and administrative research and development total costs and expenses operating income equity in net income of affiliate income before interest and income tax expense interest income interest expense income before income tax expense income tax expense net income net income per weighted average common share basic diluted other data ebit ebitda ebit and ebitda reconciliation net income income tax expense interest income interest expense ebit depreciation and amortization ebitda revenue
