item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company in the business of discovering  developing  and commercializing small molecule drugs for serious diseases  including hiv infection  chronic hepatitis c virus hcv infection  inflammatory and autoimmune disorders  cancer  pain and bacterial infection 
we earn a royalty on the sales of two vertex discovered products for the treatment of hiv infection  lexiva telzir and agenerase  and co promote these products in collaboration with glaxosmithkline plc 
our drug candidate pipeline is principally focused at present on the development and commercialization of new treatments for viral diseases  inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and cancer 
we have built a drug discovery capability that integrates biology  chemistry  biophysics  automation and information technologies  with a goal of making the drug discovery process more efficient and productive 
drug discovery and development discovery and development of a single new pharmaceutical product is a lengthy and resource intensive process which may take to years or more 
throughout this entire process  potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluation  driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations  designed to generate information concerning efficacy  proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a proposed drug candidate should be approved for marketing 
the toxicity characteristics and profile of drug candidates at varying dose levels administered for varying periods of time are also continually monitored and evaluated during the nonclinical and clinical development process 
most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into formal development  and most drug candidates that do advance into formal development never become commercial products 
a drug candidate s failure to progress or advance may be the result of any one or more of a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes including  for example  the lack of acceptable absorption characteristics or other physical properties  lack of sufficient efficacy against the disease target  difficulties in developing a cost effective manufacturing or formulation method  or the discovery of toxicities that are unacceptable for the disease indication being treated 
we have a variety of drug candidates in clinical development and a broad based drug discovery effort 
given the uncertainties of the research and development process  it is not possible to predict with confidence which  if any  of these efforts will result in a marketable pharmaceutical product 
we constantly monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical and clinical trials and regularly evaluate and re evaluate our portfolio investments with the objective of balancing risk and potential return in view of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information comes to light and we gain additional insights into ongoing programs and potential new programs 
business strategy we have elected to diversify our research and development activities across a relatively broad array of investment opportunities  due in part to the high risks associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical business 
we focus our efforts both on programs that we expect to control throughout the development and commercialization process  and programs that we expect will be conducted principally by a collaborator 
this strategy requires more significant financial resources than would be required if we pursued a more limited approach 
because we have incurred losses from our inception and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future  we are dependent in large part on our continued ability to raise significant funding to finance our discovery and development operations and our overhead and to meet our long term contractual commitments and obligations 
in the past  we have secured funds principally through capital market transactions  strategic collaborative agreements  proceeds from the disposition of assets  investment income and the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs 
at december  we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due the notes and million in principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
during and early  we took a number of steps that we believe reinforced our ability to implement our business strategy  including closing two debt exchange transactions  modifying our kinase collaboration  and signing new discovery and development collaborations 
debt exchange 
on february   we exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of newly issued notes for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes 
on september   we exchanged a further million in principal amount of newly issued notes for an equal amount of notes 
as a result of these transactions  we deferred from until the repayment date for almost of our outstanding debt 
we incurred certain charges relating to the early retirement of the notes and incremental costs in connection with the exchange transactions  and we expect our annual interest charge to be slightly higher due to the higher interest rate on the notes 
since the conversion price for the notes is significantly lower than the conversion price for the notes  we have enhanced the equity characteristics of our debt and consequently increased the likelihood that the noteholders will convert the notes to common stock at some point in the future 
kinase collaborations 
in february  we amended our collaboration agreement with novartis 
under the amended agreement  we will continue to receive research funding through april  and up to million in pre commercial payments for each preclinical drug candidate that we propose  and novartis accepts  for development 
under the original agreement  we were responsible for early development of each drug candidate through proof of concept generally phase ib or iia  funded through a development loan from novartis 
that loan would be forgiven if novartis accepted the drug candidate for further development  but was repayable if novartis elected not to develop that candidate 
under the amended agreement  novartis holds an option to develop drug candidates meeting certain pre agreed criteria 
the option is exercisable with respect to each development candidate at the pre development stage  at which point a million milestone payment is due from novartis  with up to million in additional pre commercial milestone payments due if the candidate progresses in development 
we retain all rights to any candidate not selected by novartis  as well as to all of our intellectual property generated under the collaboration that is not specific to candidates selected by novartis for development 
as part of the amended agreement  restrictions under the original agreement that limited novartis right to pursue kinase research and development outside our collaboration were removed 
in november  novartis accepted vx for preclinical development under the amended terms of our collaboration agreement  and made a million milestone payment 
the novartis amendment reduced our financial risk in connection with proof of concept development of kinase inhibitors  potentially accelerated the timing of payments associated with the selection of development candidates by novartis  and strengthened the intellectual property position that we will have in the kinase field after the current research collaboration ends in april we believe these changes will improve our ability to generate further collaborations in the field of kinase inhibition in late  which may be important for us because our novartis collaboration accounted for approximately of our total revenue in also under the amended agreement  we retained the right either to develop vx to proof of concept under the terms of the original agreement  or to elect to remove vx  and the aurora kinases that it targets  from the collaboration 
we exercised this election in june  as part of our collaboration with merck described below  and repaid to novartis approximately million in unspent and uncommitted development loans previously advanced on account of vx new collaborations 
we entered into four new collaborative relationships in and early  covering programs in which we expect to retain control over development  and programs where we expect our collaborator to control development 
in may we expanded our collaboration with cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics incorporated cfft to provide for million in research support payments in and in june  we entered into a new collaboration with mitsubishi pharma corp 
mitsubishi granting mitsubishi the right to develop and commercialize vx  our oral hepatitis c protease inhibitor  in japan and certain far east countries 
under that collaboration  mitsubishi also will provide us with financial and other support for our development of vx  which is currently in phase ib clinical development 
also in june  we entered into a global collaboration with merck co  inc merck to develop and commercialize vx  our lead aurora kinase inhibitor  for the treatment of cancer 
the merck agreement provides us with research funding in the amount of million over two years  and an up front payment of million 
in february  we licensed vx  an impdh inhibitor  to avalon pharmaceuticals  inc avalon  for development and commercialization in the treatment of cancer 
avalon has committed to make up front and milestone payments to us  conduct further development of vx and pay royalties to us if vx is successfully commercialized 
balancing of research and development during and  we elected to focus our internal development and commercialization activity on two principal areas for the intermediate term viral diseases and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
our most advanced drug candidates in these areas are merimepodib hcv infection  vx hcv infection  vx rheumatoid arthritis and vx psoriasis 
in preparation for advancing these and other vertex controlled drug candidates  we restructured our operations in the second quarter of to rebalance our relative investment in research and development 
our investment in company sponsored research declined during approximately from levels  while our investment in company sponsored development during increased over levels by approximately 
during we entered collaborations with merck and cfft that had significant research funding components  and we expect to enter into additional research based collaborations in these collaborations provide revenue to partially offset our continuing research investment and better enable us to focus our research and development spending  net of collaborator supported costs  on compounds and development candidates for which we retain significant commercial rights 
we expect our vertex controlled development activities and related expense to increase significantly during  depending on the progress of our current development candidates  both in absolute terms and in comparison with our investment in research  which should remain relatively constant over levels 
to offset this spending increase we expect to enter new collaborations that will provide additional funding for our research and development efforts in areas where sharing development efforts and commercial returns is consistent with our overall business strategy 
collaborative revenue collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy 
a significant portion of our total research effort is being conducted under our research collaborations with novartis  merck and cfft  all of which are scheduled to conclude  along with our research funding  in the period between december and june funding from our novartis collaboration  the research portion of which is scheduled to conclude in april  accounted for approximately of our total collaborative research and development revenue in our two year research collaboration with merck  for discovery of aurora kinase inhibitors to serve as back ups and or follow on candidates for vx  is scheduled to conclude in june in addition  our research collaboration with cfft provides research funding ending on december  we believe that the intellectual property rights we may retain from some or all of these collaborations may help us initiate other collaborative opportunities if our existing collaborations are not extended 
we will need to pursue those opportunities as well as other collaborations or financing alternatives in order to maintain our research effort at its existing level 
it is not possible to predict at present whether any of those collaborations or other financing alternatives will be available in and beyond 
based on the value that we believe we have built through research and development investments in certain of our drug discovery and development programs  and our perception of the level of interest in certain of our programs among some potential collaborators  we believe that we could enter into additional collaborative agreements in that would be material to our business 
our business development priorities include new collaborations to support development and commercialization of our hcv infection clinical candidates  and our oral cytokine inhibitors 
our product development pipeline also includes drug candidates such as vx pain and vx bacterial infection that we may choose to develop with a collaborator 
in and future periods we expect to identify collaborative development and commercialization opportunities for some or all of these drug candidates in order to continue their clinical advancement  as we maintain focus on controlling clinical development of certain drug candidates in the united states 
we may also seek collaborators for our ion channels and other research programs 
kendall square lease we currently lease approximately  square feet of office and laboratory space in kendall square  cambridge  massachusetts the kendall square lease  which we have decided not to occupy 
we have subleased  square feet of that space and are seeking subtenants for the unoccupied portion 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded restructuring and other expense relating to the kendall square lease of million 
our estimate of the net ongoing obligation under the kendall square lease at december  was approximately million on a discounted net present value basis  and relates to the remaining kendall square lease obligations net of estimated sublease revenue 
this estimate represents our best judgment of the assumptions and estimates most appropriate in measuring the ongoing obligation 
our estimates in this regard have changed in the past  and may change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of liability 
also  because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time value of money  the estimate will increase simply as a result of the passage of time  even if all other factors remain unchanged 
please refer to note d  restructuring and other expense  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  for a more complete discussion of the kendall square lease liability 
financial guidance the key financial measures for which we have provided guidance in are as follows loss we expect that the company s full year loss in will be in the range of to million  before certain charges and gains 
we expect a loss for the first quarter of in the range of to million  before certain charges and gains 
for purposes of these estimates  excluded charges and gains will include certain types of stock based compensation expense incurred as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payments  in july as well as any additional credits or charges associated with the kendall square lease 
revenues we expect that total revenue will be in the range of to million in this is expected to be comprised of approximately million of collaborative r d revenues from existing collaborations  including million in contracted collaborative r d funding and approximately million of revenue from milestone payments under existing collaborations  million to million from hiv product royalties  and an anticipated additional million to million from new research and product development agreements 
research and development r d expense we project that r d expense will be in the range of million to million for the forecasted increase over the r d expense level of million is driven by increased clinical development investment in our vertex controlled programs 
sales  general and administrative sg a expense we expect sg a expense to be in the range of to million for cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities we expect cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to be in excess of million at the end of the financial measures set forth above are forward looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially  including the risks and uncertainties that we describe in risk factors in item of this annual report on form k and in the section below entitled forward looking statements 
in this annual report on form k  we provide our expected financial results using certain financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in particular  our guidance for full year and first quarter loss  excluding certain charges or gains  are non gaap financial measures 
these measures are provided because we believe they help indicate underlying trends in our business  and we use these non gaap financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally to manage the company s business and to evaluate its performance 
contractual commitments and obligations the first part of the following table sets forth commitments and obligations that have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  certain other obligations and commitments  while not required under gaap to be included in the consolidated balance sheets  may have a material impact on liquidity 
we have presented these items  all of which have been entered into in the ordinary course of business  in the table below in order to present a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity 
december  and later total in thousands commitments and obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december  collaborator development loans   convertible subordinated notes   off balance sheet commitments and obligations at december  facilities operating leases     purchase obligations    research and development and other commitments  total contractual obligations and commitments   commitments and obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december  the collaborator development loans in the table above represent indebtedness to novartis in the amount of approximately million that was advanced under a loan facility established pursuant to the original collaboration agreement with novartis 
loans under the facility were intended to fund early clinical studies of kinase inhibitor compounds that we selected for early development 
in february  we amended the terms of the novartis collaboration agreement 
we will continue to be responsible for drug discovery and novartis will continue to provide research funding through the balance of the research term ending in april  as provided in the original agreement 
however  novartis will now be responsible for all nonclinical and clinical development of drug candidates that it accepts for development  and consequently the loan facility providing funding for development activities by vertex has been terminated 
outstanding loans that funded amounts either spent or committed to be spent on development activities relating to a particular compound will be forgiven if that compound is selected by novartis for development 
if the compound is not selected by novartis  the related loan will be repayable without interest in may please refer to note o  significant revenue arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding these loans 
at december   we had million in aggregate principal amount of notes and million in aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding 
for both the and notes  we are required to make semi annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the notes 
our aggregate annual interest payment obligation is approximately million 
off balance sheet commitments and obligations at december  at december   our future minimum commitments and contractual obligations included facilities operating leases  a purchase obligation and contractual commitments related to our research and development programs 
these items are not required to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheets under gaap 
they are disclosed in the table presented above and described more fully in the following paragraphs in order to provide a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity at december  our kendall square lease term began january  and we began making lease payments in may we have an obligation  staged over a number of years  to build out the leased space into finished laboratory and office space 
the lease will expire in  and we have options to extend for two consecutive terms of ten years each 
the company s future minimum commitments under the kendall square lease for each year commencing january   including lease payments and a construction obligation  are million for  million for and  million for and and million for all of the years thereafter and are included in the table above 
in june  we decided not to occupy the space under this lease and to seek to sublease the space to third parties to minimize our on going lease obligations 
see note d  restructuring and other expense  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
commitments under research and development programs represent contractual commitments entered into for materials and services in the normal course of business 
the purchase obligations referred to above include an agreement to purchase a minimum of million of certain specified products from invitrogen corporation annually for three years  to which we agreed in connection with the sale of certain assets of our former discovery tools and services business on march  the purchase obligations referred to above do not include severance pay obligations to each of five executive officers of the company in the event of a not for cause termination under existing employment contracts 
the cash amount for which the company might be liable upon any such termination  based on current executive pay and bonus levels could range from  to  liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since our inception and historically have financed our operations principally through public stock offerings  private placements of our equity and debt securities  strategic collaborative agreements that include research and development funding  development milestones and royalties on the sales of products  proceeds from the disposition of assets of our discovery tools and services business  investment income and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  which is a decrease of  from  at december  the decrease of  is primarily due to the net cash used in operations of  which included cash payments of  made in connection with the restructuring and other expense accrual 
in addition  restricted cash increased  due to the issuance of stand by letters of credit pursuant to the kendall square lease agreement 
repayments under our loan facility with novartis were  for the twelve months ended december   bringing the balance outstanding under the loan facility to  expenditures for property and equipment were  cash receipts from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit programs during were  as part of our strategy to manage our long term operating cash needs  we exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of newly issued notes for an equal principal amount of our notes 
the notes were issued through private offerings to qualified institutional buyers 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into common stock at a price equal to  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into common stock at a price equal to  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
issuance costs associated with the notes were million 
the restructuring accrual relating to our decision not to occupy our facility in kendall square was million at december  we review our estimates underlying the restructuring accrual on at least a quarterly basis  and the accrual  and consequently any expected future payment  could change with any change in our estimates 
in connection with new collaborations in  we received approximately million in up front payments 
consistent with our revenue recognition policy  we have deferred recognition of the majority of these payments  which will be recognized over the related contract term 
in february  we amended the terms of our collaboration agreement with novartis 
under the amended agreement  novartis is responsible for all nonclinical and clinical development of drug candidates that it accepts for development 
consequently  the loan facility established under the original agreement  which provided funding for development activities by vertex  has been terminated 
as permitted under the amended agreement  on june   we gave notice to novartis of our election to develop vx outside of our novartis collaboration 
as a result  we repaid to novartis approximately million of unspent and uncommitted loan amounts relating to vx at december   we had approximately million in remaining loans outstanding under the loan facility 
loans advanced by novartis for the development of collaboration compounds under the original agreement will be forgiven on a compound by compound basis if any such compounds are selected by novartis for development 
all loans not forgiven under the facility will be repayable  without interest  in may we expect to continue to make significant investments in our pipeline  particularly in clinical trials of our anti hcv infection and anti cytokine product candidates  in our ion channel and kinase discovery efforts and in our effort to prepare for potential registration  regulatory approval and commercial launch of our product candidates 
consequently  we expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and commercialize existing and future drug candidates 
we also expect to incur substantial administrative expenditures in the future and expenses related to filing  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property rights 
in and in future periods  the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements  including repayment of the notes and the notes  will depend on many factors  including the number  breadth and prospects of our discovery and development programs and the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates 
collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy 
we will continue to rely on cash receipts from our existing research and development collaborations  including research funding  development reimbursements and potential milestone payments  and from new collaborations  in order to help fund our research and development efforts 
as part of our strategy for managing our capital structure  we have from time to time adjusted the amount and maturity of our debt obligations in prior periods through new issues  privately negotiated transactions and market purchases  depending on market conditions and our perceived needs at the time 
during we expect to continue pursuit of a general financial strategy that may lead us to undertake one or more additional capital transactions  which may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past 
to the extent that our current cash and marketable securities  in addition to the above mentioned sources  are not sufficient to fund our activities  it will be necessary to raise additional funds through public offerings or private placements of our securities or other methods of financing 
we will also continue to manage our capital structure and consider all financing opportunities  whenever they may occur  that could strengthen our long term liquidity profile 
there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods 
these items are constantly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that the application of the accounting policies for restructuring and other expenses  revenue recognition  research and development expenses and investments  all of which are important to our financial position and results of operations  require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
our accounting polices  including the ones discussed below  are more fully described in note b  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
restructuring and other expense we record liabilities associated with restructuring activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred  in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
these estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
adjustments are based  among other things  on management s assessment of changes in factors underlying the estimates  the impact of which is measured using the credit adjusted risk free discount rate of approximately applied in the period when we first incurred the liability 
on june   we announced a plan to restructure our operations in preparation for increased investment in the clinical development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
we designed the restructuring to rebalance our relative investment in research and development  to better support our long term objective of becoming an integrated pharmaceutical company 
the restructuring included a workforce reduction  write offs of certain assets and a decision not to occupy the kendall square facility 
we have subleased approximately  square feet of this facility and are actively seeking to sublease the unoccupied portion to offset our ongoing lease obligations 
in accordance with sfas  we recorded an initial estimate of the fair value of the estimated liability in the second quarter of we have reviewed our assumptions and estimates quarterly and have updated the estimated amount of the liability as changes in circumstances have required 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded restructuring and other expenses of million relating to our estimated net ongoing obligations under the kendall square lease 
the million of restructuring and other expense recorded is primarily the result of revising certain key estimates and assumptions about when subtenants will be identified and secured and incurring an imputed interest charge for the related restructuring liability 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded restructuring and other related expenses of million 
the million included million of lease restructuring expense for the kendall square lease 
in addition to the million  other costs included in the million charge included million of lease operating expense incurred prior to the decision not to occupy the kendall square facility  million for severance and related employee transition benefits and million for a write off of leasehold improvements and other assets 
the charge for the lease restructuring was the most significant component of the total restructuring charge recorded during and the only component of the restructuring and other expense accrual remaining to be settled at december  we are required to make significant judgments and assumptions when estimating the liability for our net ongoing obligations under the kendall square lease 
in accordance with sfas  we use a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the amount of the liability associated with the lease restructuring 
we applied a discount rate of approximately 
the probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis is based on management s assumptions and estimates of our ongoing lease obligations  including contractual rental and build out commitments  and sublease rentals  including estimates of sublease timing and sublease rental terms 
we validate our estimates and assumptions through consultations with independent third parties having relevant expertise 
it is possible that our estimates and assumptions will change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the amount of the estimated liability  and the effect of any adjustments could be material 
for example  if sublease rental rates differ from our assumption by approximately in either direction  our recorded liability will be negatively or positively adjusted by approximately million 
if our estimated subleasing timetable is delayed by six months  the impact could be as high as approximately million in additional estimated liability  or more  if there is further delay 
we will review our assumptions and judgments related to the potential lease restructuring on at least a quarterly basis  until the outcome is finalized  and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and for revenue arrangements entered into after june   emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
our collaborative and other research and development revenue is generated primarily through collaborative research and development agreements with strategic collaborators 
the terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of non refundable up front license fees  funding for research and development efforts  payments to us based upon achievement of certain milestones  and royalties payable on product sales 
we recognize revenue from non refundable  up front license fees and milestones  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the contracted or estimated period of performance 
changes in estimates could materially affect revenue in the period the estimate is changed 
if our estimate of the period of performance shortens or lengthens  the amount of revenue we recognize from non refundable  up front license fees and milestones could increase or decrease in the period the change in estimate becomes known 
future related revenues would be adjusted accordingly 
to date  changes to our estimates have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
research funding is recognized ratably over the period of effort  as earned 
milestones that are based on designated achievement points and that are considered at risk and substantive at the inception of the collaboration agreement are recognized as earned when management considers the corresponding payment to be reasonably assured 
we evaluate whether milestones are at risk and substantive based on the contingent nature of the milestone  specifically reviewing factors such as the technological and commercial risk that must be overcome and the level of investment required 
under eitf  in multiple element arrangements  license payments are recognized together with any up front payment and the research and development funding as a single unit of accounting  unless the delivered technology has stand alone value to the customer and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements in the arrangement 
license payments received during the course of a collaboration that do not meet the separation criteria above are recognized  when earned  in proportion to the period of time completed on the contract relative to the total contracted or estimated period of performance on the underlying research and development collaboration  with the remaining amount deferred and recognized ratably over the remaining period of performance 
payments received after performance obligations are complete are recognized when earned 
royalty revenue is recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories  as provided by our collaborator glaxosmithkline  and is recognized in the period the sales occur 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues  which have not historically been significant  are reconciled and adjusted for in the quarter they become known 
research and development costs all research and development costs  including amounts funded by research and development collaborations  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities costs  overhead costs  clinical trial costs  contract services and other outside costs 
clinical trial  contract services and other outside costs require that we make estimates of the costs incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at period end  because the third party service periods and billing terms do not always coincide with our period end 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract  where applicable 
altus investment we assess our investment in altus pharmaceuticals  inc  for which we account using the cost method  on a quarterly basis to determine if there has been any estimated decrease in the fair value of that investment below its million carrying value that might require us to write down the cost basis of the asset 
if any adjustment to the fair value of an investment reflects a decline in the value of that investment below its cost  we consider the evidence available to us  including the duration and extent to which the decline is other than temporary 
if the decline is considered other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down is included in the consolidated statements of operations 
we have not identified facts or circumstances which would cause us to determine that the investment basis of our interest in altus should be changed 
results of operations the following discussion of revenues and expenses is based only on the results of our continuing operations 
we sold the assets of our discovery tools and services business in two independent transactions in march and december in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas no 
 the results of operations associated with the assets sold have been reclassified on the consolidated financial statements under the heading discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  and december  the reclassification of the amounts to discontinued operations has been prepared using estimates and assumptions we have deemed appropriate based upon the information currently available 
amounts reclassified to discontinued operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been achieved had the discovery tools and services business operated on a stand alone basis during the periods presented 
as a result of the disposition of these assets  we now operate in a single operating segment pharmaceuticals 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our net loss for was  or per basic and diluted common share  compared to a net loss for of  or per basic and diluted common share 
our loss in includes restructuring and other expense of  and a charge for the retirement of convertible notes of  our loss in includes restructuring and other expense of  and income from discontinued operations of  included in the income from discontinued operations is a gain from the sale of assets of  our net loss for  as compared with our net loss for  decreased primarily as a result of increased revenue  principally related to new collaboration agreements and increased royalties 
total revenues increased to  in compared to  in in  revenue was comprised of  in royalties and  in collaborative and other research and development revenue  as compared with  in royalties and  in collaborative research and development revenue in royalties consist of lexiva telzir fosamprenavir calcium and agenerase amprenavir royalty revenue 
fosamprenavir calcium is marketed under the trade name lexiva in the united states and telzir in the european union 
royalty revenue is based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase 
we began earning royalties on sales of lexiva telzir in the united states in november and in the european union in november lexiva has largely replaced agenerase in the united states market 
we pay a royalty to a third party on sales of agenerase and lexiva telzir 
collaborative and other research and development revenue increased  or  in as compared with the increase in collaborative and other research and development revenue is due to the execution of three new collaboration agreements with cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics incorporated cfft cystic fibrosis drug discovery  mitsubishi pharma corporation far east development of vx  and merck co  inc research and development of aurora kinase inhibitors  including vx and recognized revenue of approximately million from a million milestone payment in connection with novartis selection of vx for development 
we also earned  in milestone revenue from glaxosmithkline relating to regulatory approval of telzir in the european union and the initiation of phase ii clinical trials for vx the table presented below is a summary of significant revenue arrangements for the year ended as compared with the year ended in thousands collaborative and other research and development revenue summary of significant collaborative revenue arrangements novartis   merck  cfft  mitsubishi pharma  other   total collaborative and other research and development revenue  research funding under our collaboration with serono concluded on september  we expect that collaborative and other research and development revenues will continue to be a significant component of our total revenues and we are seeking to enter into additional collaboration agreements in that could be material to our business

in  we engaged in development activities with drug candidates targeting potential therapeutic indications other than viral and inflammatory diseases  including vx oncology  which is now licensed to avalon pharmaceuticals  inc and vx oncology  which is now licensed to merck co  inc during  we continued clinical studies of our compound for the treatment of hcv infection  initiating a phase iib study called the metro study of merimepodib in combination with pegasys peginterferon alfa a and copegus ribavirin 
we completed a phase ia study of vx  also for the treatment of hcv infection  and began a phase ib evaluation of vx in patients with chronic hcv infection 
during the fourth quarter of we also commenced phase ii clinical development of vx in psoriasis

vertex has co promotion rights in the united states and the european union 
sanofi aventis has notified us that it intends to terminate our collaboration for the development of pralnacasan 
upon the effectiveness of that termination  all commercial and other rights to pralnacasan will revert to vertex 
to date we have incurred in excess of billion in research and development costs associated with drug discovery and development 
we expect research and development expenses in to be greater than in due to increased clinical development as we advance our core programs 
however  our anticipated research and development expenses could vary materially  depending on the occurrence and timing of clinical trials 
we expect that our combined research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we add personnel and capabilities to support the advancement of our lead drug candidates 
we do not expect that our research expenses will increase significantly unless we obtain a significant amount of funding from new collaborations 
we estimate that it takes to years or possibly longer  to discover  develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the us as outlined below phase objective estimated duration discovery lead identification and target validation to years preclinical initial toxicology for preliminary identification of risks for humans  gather early pharmacokinetic data to years phase i evaluate safety in humans  study how the drug works  metabolizes and interacts with other drugs to years phase ii establish effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage  continue safety evaluation to years phase iii confirm efficacy  dosage regime and safety profile of the drug  submit new drug application to years fda approval approval by the fda to sell and market the drug under approved labeling months to years animal and other nonclinical studies typically are conducted during each phase of human clinical studies 
the successful development of our products is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk factors 
the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from preclinical  nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and cost of discovery  preclinical  nonclinical and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict 
therefore  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
the most significant costs associated with drug discovery and development are those costs associated with phase ii and phase iii clinical trials 
given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our drug candidates will generate revenue and net cash inflows 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  in from  in the increase is partially attributable to increased professional consulting expenses incurred to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as increased costs related to the further development of our patent portfolio and increased business development costs associated with the pursuit of new collaborative relationships 
restructuring and other expense for the twelve months ended december  was million 
the expense recorded during reflects a revision of our key estimates and assumptions  specifically relating to the projected sublease rental rates and timing of subleases  as well as the imputed interest cost related to the restructuring accrual

it is possible that those estimates and assumptions could change in the future resulting in incremental expense or  alternatively  in reversal of expense  and the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
interest income decreased approximately  to  in from  in the decrease is mainly the result of both a lower level of invested funds and lower portfolio yields due to a reduced interest rate environment

in  our clinical trials focused on multiple drug candidates in a variety of therapeutic areas 
the results of these trials enabled us to direct our principal clinical focus toward compounds in two therapeutic areas viral diseases and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
our lead drug candidates in these areas are merimepodib hcv infection  vx hcv infection  vx autoimmune diseases and vx inflammatory diseases

quantitative and qualitive disclosures about market risk as part of its investment portfolio  vertex owns financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve vertex s capital until it is required to fund operations  including vertex s research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
vertex does not have derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
interest rate risk vertex invests its cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the united states government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
all of vertex s interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
substantially all of vertex s investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity  and vertex has implemented guidelines limiting the term to maturity of its investment instruments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  vertex does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk
