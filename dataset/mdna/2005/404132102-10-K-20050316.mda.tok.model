item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we primarily receive our revenue from earned premium derived from our insurance company operations  fee and commission income generated by our agency operations  ceding commissions in excess of policy acquisition costs earned by our insurance company operations  investment income from all of our operations  and other operating income 
our core underwriting activities involve providing insurance products in the group life  accident and health  diversified financial products  london market account  aviation and other specialty lines of business  each of which is marketed by our insurance companies and our underwriting agencies either through a network of independent agents and brokers or directly to customers 
during the past several years  we have substantially increased our shareholders equity through retaining our earnings  other than dividends to shareholders  and through the issuance of our common stock  thereby enabling us to increase the underwriting capacity of our insurance companies and make acquisitions 
with this additional equity  we increased underwriting activity across many of our businesses adding new lines of business and emphasizing lines of business and individual opportunities with the most favorable underwriting characteristics at a particular point in the insurance cycle 
as an insurer  we also purchase reinsurance for many of our lines of business 
we purchase different types of reinsurance in amounts we consider appropriate for our individual lines of business based on market conditions and the level of risk we wish to retain 
market conditions improved across all of our lines of business during the period through  primarily due to the extended period of severe competition during the s  resulting in extremely poor underwriting results for most of the insurance industry 
this improvement accelerated after the september  terrorist attack and continued throughout  with significant rate increases particularly evident in our diversified financial products line of business 
premium rates in some of our lines began to soften in  although the rate decreases were more gradual than the prior increases so that our underwriting activities remain very profitable 
we have expanded our underwriting activities and increased our retentions in response to these market conditions and plan to continue these actions as long as market conditions warrant 
during the past three years  we acquired numerous companies in transactions that were recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations and cash flows of these 
table of contents companies are included in our operations beginning on the effective date of each transaction 
the following table provides a list of our most important acquisitions

we recognized a pre tax loss after reinsurance of million in our insurance company segment 
this loss included million recorded in loss and loss adjustment expense and million for premiums to reinstate our excess of loss reinsurance protection  which reduced net earned premium 
the effect of the hurricanes increased our net loss ratio and our combined ratio 
during  we reached an agreement with various reinsurers to commute certain reinsurance recoverables relating to our assumed accident and health business in our discontinued line of business 
we received a cash payment  which was less than the related recoverable  from the reinsurers in consideration for discounting the recoverables and reassuming the losses 
the pre tax loss of million was included in loss and loss adjustment expense in our insurance company segment 
the effect of the commutation increased our net loss ratio and combined ratio 

table of contents the following table sets forth the relationships of certain income statement items as a percent of total revenue 
net earned premium fee and commission income net investment income net realized investment gain other operating income total revenue loss and loss adjustment expense  net total operating expense interest expense earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense income tax expense earnings from continuing operations total revenue increased to billion in and to million in  driven by significant growth in net earned premium  fee and commission income  and investment income 
approximately of the increase in revenue and of the increase in revenue was due to the acquisition of subsidiaries 
we expect the growth in total revenue to continue in gross written premium  net written premium and net earned premium are detailed below 
we have experienced significant increases in premium due to organic growth of our diversified financial products line of business and acquisitions over the past three years 
see the insurance company segment section below for further discussion of the relationship and changes in premium revenue 
gross written premium net written premium net earned premium the table below shows the source of our fee and commission income 
agencies insurance companies other fee and commission income fee and commission income increased to million in and to million in agencies increased and insurance companies increased year over year in and and  respectively  year over year in the largest increase has been in our diversified financial products line of business due to acquisitions made during late  which have continued to grow their business in and our london reinsurance broker has also contributed to the growth for each year 
we expect fee and commission income to decrease in as  effective january   we consolidated one of our largest underwriting agencies into our life insurance company 
in addition  we have increased our retentions in certain lines of business  which results in less ceded reinsurance and therefore less commissions to our insurance companies and our reinsurance brokers 
however  these actions will increase our underwriting profits in our insurance company subsidiaries 

table of contents the sources of net investment income are detailed below 
fixed income securities short term investments other investments total investment income investment expense net investment income net investment income increased to million in and in  compared to the prior year 
these increases were due to higher investment assets  which increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  and billion at december  the growth in investment assets resulted from significant cash flow from operations and increased net loss reserves in both years  our public offering of stock in  commutations completed in and  and  to a lesser extent  from acquisitions 
net investment income increased despite low yields on our fixed income and short term investments 
if market interest rates rise  the growth in investment income would be expected to accelerate  since our operating cash flow  short term investments  investment income and current maturities from our long term portfolio could be invested at higher rates 
we expect investment assets and investment income to increase during other operating income increased million in both and  compared to the prior year 
the increase includes million of income related to two mortgage impairment insurance policies  which are written as insurance policies but treated for accounting purposes as derivative financial instruments  and a million gain from the sale of a building 
the increase was due to increased gains on our portfolio of insurance related trading securities and our investment in argonaut group  inc period to period comparisons in this category may vary substantially depending on other operating investments or dispositions of such investments 
compensation expense increased in and in  primarily due to the addition of employees from acquired subsidiaries and increases in incentive compensation due to increased profitability 
excluding discontinued operations  we had  employees at year end   at year end  and  at year end these amounts include approximately employees added in december  approximately employees added in january and approximately employees added in october  due to acquisitions 
the rate of increase in compensation expense for subsidiaries not acquired during the last two years was less than the rate of increase in revenue  thereby contributing to higher margins and increased net earnings 
other operating expense increased million in and million in the increases in and were principally due to additional expenses of acquired subsidiaries 
during  we also expensed million to cover estimated settlement costs related to pending litigation 
in  there was a one time currency gain of million from settlement of an advance of funds to an unaffiliated entity 
our effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was for  compared to for and for the effective tax rate decreased primarily because our tax exempt interest income increased as a percentage of our pre tax income  due to the increase in the tax exempt component of our investment portfolio  and because a higher proportion of our pre tax income was earned by our insurance company subsidiaries and not subject to state income taxes 
in december  we sold the business of our retail brokerage subsidiary  hcc employee benefits  inc  for million in cash 
we recognized a gain of million million after tax in and an estimated additional gain of million million after tax from a contractual earnout in the after tax earnings from discontinued operations and the after tax gain on sale are reported as earnings from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings 

table of contents at december   book value per share was  up from at december  total assets were billion and shareholders equity was billion  up from billion and billion  respectively  at december  segments insurance company segment net earnings of our insurance company segment increased to million in compared to million in  which in turn increased from million in the net earnings included an after tax loss of million due to the hurricanes and the net earnings included an after tax loss of million due to a commutation 
offsetting the effects of the hurricanes and the commutation were higher gross premium volume  increased retentions  improved underwriting results and increased investment income  all of which contributed to the growth in segment net earnings 
in addition  the acquisition of american contractors indemnity company contributed million to the increase in net earnings during we expect net earnings from our insurance companies to continue to grow in the following table details premium amounts and their percentages of gross written premium

gross written premium increased to billion in and in net written premium increased to billion in and in  and net earned premium increased to billion in and in these increases were due to organic growth  a higher retention level in our group life  accident and health  diversified financial products and aviation lines of business  and the acquisitions of american contractors indemnity company in january  ra mco in october  and hcc global  hcc diversified and hcc europe in late gross written premium is expected to remain relatively flat in as we maintain our underwriting discipline as rates soften and competition increases 
net written premium is expected to continue to increase in  primarily due to increased retentions 
the changes in premium volume and retention levels between years resulted principally from the following factors the largest premium growth  both gross and net  was in our diversified financial products line of business 
we experienced organic growth in our directors and officers businesses  as well as 
table of contents increases in our professional indemnity and surety business due to organic growth and acquisitions 
in  there was increasing competition in the insurance industry and to a lesser degree in our specialty lines  but we believe that our business will remain very profitable  at least through we expect much slower growth in gross written premium in as we become more selective  although net written premium will continue to grow from higher retentions 
our increased retentions resulted from a reduction of proportional reinsurance  some of which has been replaced by excess of loss reinsurance 
our other specialty line of business increased significantly due to the marine business written by an underwriting agency we acquired in  our quota share participation on the surplus lines business written by argonaut group  inc beginning in  and our participation in a specialty lloyd s syndicate beginning in growth in both gross and net premiums will slow down in we reduced our london market account premium writings due to more selective underwriting in response to reduced premium rates from increased competition 
net written premium was also lower in than in  due to the impact of reinstatement premiums under our catastrophe reinsurance programs as a result of the hurricane activity in the third quarter of net written premium was reduced by million for reinstatement premiums  compared to only million in risk retention in this line of business usually is lower than most of our other active lines of business  since the majority of the london market risks have catastrophe exposure  but retained premium is higher because reinsurance is predominantly on an excess of loss basis 
although the immediate effect of the hurricanes was to slow the softening of premium rates for property and energy business  at least temporarily  we cannot anticipate what impact the hurricanes will have on pricing in while competition continues to result in some premium rate reductions in our aviation and group life  accident and health lines of business  profit margins are very acceptable and the markets are relatively stable 
we increased our retentions in both lines in and again in overall  our retentions increased on most non catastrophe business as underwriting profitability stayed predictable 
we consider our overall market to be relatively stable  although premium rates are still softening  but as long as our margins remain well above an acceptable level  we will continue to retain more of the risk 
we are very disciplined underwriters and will not hesitate to reduce our business if market conditions deteriorate below our projected level 
we increased the overall percentage of retained risk from in to in to in  although substantially more on certain lines of business 
annually  we analyze our overall threshold for risk  then structure a specific reinsurance program for each line of business we underwrite 
we purchase reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks  to protect against catastrophe losses and volatility and to achieve a desired ratio of net written premium to policyholders surplus 
we purchase reinsurance on a proportional basis where we pay a pro rata portion of the premium we receive to cover loss frequency  individual risk severity and catastrophe exposure 
we also purchase reinsurance on an excess of loss basis where we pay a specific reinsurance premium to cover individual risk severity and catastrophe exposure 
additionally  we may obtain facultative reinsurance protection on a single risk 
the type  cost and limits of reinsurance we purchase vary year to year based on our perception of the particular risks inherent in the policies underwritten  our desired retention levels based on profitability  and the market availability of quality reinsurance at an acceptable price

our net loss and loss adjustment expense deficiency was million in and million in  compared to a redundancy of million in during  as a result of adverse development in certain assumed accident and health business in our discontinued line of business  we strengthened our reserves on this line to bring them above our actuarial point estimate 
the deficiency resulted primarily from losses and reserve strengthening of million related to the accident and health business 
the deficiency resulted from a commutation charge of million  partially offset by a net redundancy of million from all other sources 
deficiencies and redundancies in the reserves occur as we continually review our loss reserves with our actuaries  increasing or reducing loss reserves as a result of such reviews and as losses are finally settled and claims exposures are reduced 
we believe we have provided for all material net incurred losses

table of contents information received and our continuing evaluation of reserves related to this business 
this re evaluation was due to a combination of factors including late reporting by insureds  reinsureds and guaranty associations  changes in our actuarial assumptions to reflect additional information received  and the nature of the business  which is primarily excess of loss reinsurance business where claims can develop slowly 
during  we reduced gross incurred but not reported losses for prior accident years on certain of our london market account business by million  since these reserves were determined to be redundant 
during  we incurred a million gross loss on a large warehouse fire and reduced gross losses related to prior accident years on a discontinued aggregate program by million based on revised current information 
on this same program in  we recorded million of adverse gross development 
also  during we reduced our gross losses from the september terrorist attacks by million and our gross loss from the total oil company loss by million to its ultimate settlement amount  thereby lowering the gross loss ratio 
the majority of the discontinued and london market business discussed above was substantially reinsured  therefore  the net development was substantially less than the gross development 
the following table provides comparative net loss ratios by line of business 
net net net net net net earned loss earned loss earned loss premium ratio premium ratio premium ratio group life  accident and health diversified financial products london market account aviation other specialty lines discontinued lines totals expense ratio combined ratio comments on net loss ratios by line of business follow group life  accident and health the net loss ratio was higher than due to the increase in premium rates on recent business written being slightly lower than the trend in medical costs  as a result of increased pricing competition 
however  underwriting margins in this line of business remain very acceptable 
diversified financial products the surety business of american contractors indemnity company  acquired in january  has a significantly lower loss ratio compared to our other products in this line 
as surety business increases  it will have more impact on the diversified financial products net loss ratio 
loss ratios on the other business written in this line remained very stable 
london market account in  the hurricanes increased the loss ratio 
otherwise  loss ratios improved in because we have been more selective in our underwriting and have moved to higher layer excess of loss business where there is less loss frequency 
aviation the hurricanes increased the loss ratio for otherwise  underwriting results have generally been better in than in the low loss ratio in was due to unusually good loss experience in that year 

table of contents other specialty lines the non catastrophe loss ratio was as expected for new business activities commenced during the past year 
the hurricanes increased the net loss ratio for discontinued lines all periods have been affected by reserve additions resulting from our ongoing review of outstanding claims and additional information received 
the loss ratio was impacted by losses of million on certain accident and health business 
as a result of adverse development in our discontinued line of business  we strengthened our reserves on this line to bring them above our actuarial point estimate 
the loss ratio was impacted by the million commutation loss  and the loss ratio was increased due to a million reserve charge 
policy acquisition costs  which are net of the related portion of commissions on reinsurance ceded  increased to million during from million in and million in these increases were proportionate to the increase in net earned premium after consideration of factors changing our expense ratio 
the increase in the expense ratio was a result of reduced ceding commissions due to higher retentions  plus additional expenses of the surety business at american contractors indemnity company  acquired in january as is common in the industry  our surety business has a significantly higher expense ratio than our other lines of business  although the surety business also has a much lower expected loss ratio 
the decrease in the expense ratio was due to changes in the mix of business and spreading certain costs over a larger premium volume 
regulatory guidelines suggest that a property and casualty insurer s annual statutory gross written premium should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus and net written premium should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus 
however  industry standards and rating agency criteria place these ratios at and  respectively 
our property and casualty insurance companies have maintained premium to surplus ratios lower than such guidelines 
for the year ended december   our statutory gross written premium to policyholders surplus was 
for the year ended december   our statutory net written premium to policyholders surplus was 
at december   each of our domestic insurance companies total adjusted capital was significantly in excess of the authorized control level risk based capital level prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners 
agency segment revenue from our agency segment increased to million in compared to  primarily from increased new business 
acquisitions accounted for approximately one third of the million increase in revenue 
segment net earnings increased to million in the lower percentage increase in net earnings was due to higher corporate expense allocations in  plus additional incentive compensation expense based on the underwriting profitability of the business written 
revenue and net earnings from our agency operations increased and  respectively  in compared to these increases were primarily due to the incremental business activity of three agencies that we acquired in the fourth quarter of we expect the revenue and net earnings of this segment to decrease in as  effective january   we consolidated one of our largest underwriting agencies into our life insurance company 
in addition  the reduced amount of ceded reinsurance due to increased retentions will result in less agency fees and commissions  but increased insurance company revenue 
liquidity and capital resources we receive substantial cash from premiums  reinsurance recoverables  fee and commission income and  to a lesser extent  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
our principal cash outflows are for the payment of claims and loss adjustment expenses  premium payments to reinsurers  purchases of investments  debt service  policy acquisition costs  operating expenses  taxes and dividends 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  an increase of million compared to and compared to our cash provided by operating activities has increased in 
table of contents recent years  principally due to our increasing net earnings  growth in net written premium and net loss reserves due to organic growth and increased retentions  commutations of selected reinsurance agreements and expansion of our diversified financial products line of business 
the components of our net operating cash flows are detailed in the following table 
net earnings change in premium  claims and other receivables  net of reinsurance  other payables and restricted cash change in unearned premium  net change in loss and loss adjustment expense payable  net of reinsurance recoverables gain on sale of subsidiary other  net cash provided by operating activities operating cash flows fluctuated due to timing differences in the payment of claims and the collection of related recoverables  and the collection of receivables and the payment of related liabilities 
over the past three years  we have increased the percentage of business we retain from in to in this increased our cash flow from premiums by reducing the amount of cash we paid to reinsurers 
in addition  as we write more business in our diversified financial products line  our net unearned premium and reserves continue to grow due to expansion of this line and the fact that products in this line generally experience a longer time period between reporting and payment of claims 
since these claims are resolved over a longer period of time  we hold the premium dollars longer until claims are paid compared to our other lines of business 
other cash provided by operating activities was reduced approximately million in for a federal income tax payment related to the gain on the subsidiary sold in december we maintain a substantial level of cash and liquid short term investments to meet anticipated payment obligations 
our combined cash and investment portfolio increased million during and totaled billion at december  the increase resulted from strong operating cash flows  our million public stock offering and numerous commutations in the fourth quarter of  and our january acquisition of american contractors indemnity company 
included in short term investments at december  is million of funds held by underwriting agencies or reinsurance brokers for the benefit of insurance or reinsurance clients 
we earn the interest income on these funds 
we invest our funds in highly rated fixed income securities 
our strategy is to maximize interest income and yield  rather than to maximize total return 
our portfolio is managed by an outside investment advisor on an active basis in compliance with investment policies promulgated by us 
in accordance with this strategy  realized gains and losses from sales of investment securities are usually minimal  unless we decide to capture gains to enhance statutory capital and surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries 
our portfolio turnover will fluctuate  depending upon opportunities to increase yields by replacing one security with another higher yielding security 
information about our portfolio of fixed income securities was as follows average yield average tax equivalent yield weighted average maturity years years years weighted average duration years years years average s p rating aaa aa aa 
table of contents the average duration of our claims in many of our lines of business is relatively short and  accordingly  our investment portfolio has a relatively short duration 
as we expand the directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability components of our diversified financial products lines of business  which have a longer claims duration  the average duration of our claims is expected to increase 
we are taking these changes into consideration in determining the duration of our investment portfolio 
we have also kept the duration of our portfolio relatively short during the recent period of very low interest rates in expectation of higher interest rates 
we have started to extend the duration and maturities of our investments to take advantage of higher long term market interest rates 
the following table compares our insurance company subsidiaries cash and investment maturities with their estimated future claims payments at december  maturities estimated payment dates total thereafter cash and investment maturities of insurance companies estimated loss and loss adjustment expense payments  net of reinsurance estimated available cash flow as demonstrated in the above table  we maintain sufficient liquidity to pay anticipated policyholder claims 
in addition  we can use operating cash flow to pay claims as they become due 
at december   the weighted average duration of our claims payable is approximately two years 
we manage the liquidity of our insurance company subsidiaries such that each subsidiary s anticipated claims payments will be met by its own current operating cash flows  cash  short term investments or investment maturities 
we do not foresee the need to sell securities prior to their maturity to fund claims payments  nor do we anticipate needing to use our million revolving loan facility to pay claims 
however  this credit facility can provide additional liquidity if such an unexpected event was to occur 
the market value of our fixed income securities is sensitive to changing interest rates 
as interest rates increase  the market value will generally decrease and as rates decrease  the market value will generally increase 
the fluctuations in market value are somewhat muted by the relatively short duration of our portfolio 
during  the net after tax unrealized gain on our investments recorded in other comprehensive income increased million due to market value changes 
we estimate that a increase in interest rates would decrease the market value of our fixed income securities by approximately million and a decrease would increase the market value by a like amount 
some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of our portfolio will mature at any point in time 
fluctuations in interest rates have a minimal effect on the value of our short term investments due to their very short maturities 
in our current position  higher interest rates would have a positive effect on net earnings 

table of contents the following table presents a summary of our total contractual cash payment obligations by estimated payment date at december  to prepare this table  we made certain estimates and assumptions  which are explained in the table s footnotes 
estimated payment dates total thereafter gross loss and loss adjustment expense payable group life  accident and health diversified financial products london market account aviation other specialty lines discontinued lines total loss and loss adjustment expense payable life and annuity policy benefits convertible notes convertible exchange notes other notes payable million revolving loan facility operating leases total obligations the estimated loss and loss adjustment expense payments for future periods assume that the percentage of ultimate losses paid from one period to the next period will be relatively consistent over time 
the actual payments will be influenced by many factors and could vary from the estimated amounts above 
amounts include interest payable in respective periods 
the convertible notes mature in  but are shown in the column because of a put option on april  the convertible exchange notes mature in  but are shown in the column because of a put option on september  both convertible notes have various put and redemption dates as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in this table  we have included interest on these notes until the respective put dates 
in conjunction with the sale of business assets and subsidiaries  we have provided indemnifications to the buyers 
certain indemnifications cover typical representations and warranties related to our responsibilities to perform under the sales contract 
other indemnifications agree to reimburse the purchaser for taxes or erisa related amounts  if any  assessed after the sale date but related to pre sale activities 
certain of these indemnifications have no time limit 
for those with a time limit  the longest such indemnification expires on december  if a claim has not been made  we have not recorded a liability related to these indemnifications since  at this time  we do not know of any circumstances that would create a claim 
we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount covered by these indemnifications as the indemnifications cover many matters  operations and possibilities  the total exposure to which is not presently quantifiable 
one indemnification was given by a company we acquired  before its acquisition  in connection with the sale of a subsidiary 
this indemnification  which has no time limit or cap  covers certain net losses incurred on insurance contracts entered into before the sale date 
the indemnification requires that we reimburse the purchaser 
table of contents after it pays covered claims to policyholders 
we have a liability of million recorded at december  to cover our anticipated payments under this indemnification 
the principal assets of hcc are the shares of capital stock of its insurance company subsidiaries 
historically  we have not relied on dividends from our insurance companies to meet the parent holding company s obligations  which are primarily outstanding debt and debt service obligations  dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses  as we have had sufficient cash flow from our agencies to meet our corporate cash flow requirements 
however  as more profit is now expected to be earned in our insurance companies  we may have to partially depend on cash flow from our insurance companies in the future 
principal payments on our convertible notes are not required until and and any puts of these notes under their terms  which have been minimal to date  could be substantially funded by our million revolving loan facility 
the payment of dividends by our insurance companies is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries 
hcc s three direct insurance company subsidiaries can pay an aggregate of million in dividends in without obtaining special permission from state regulatory authorities 
in  one insurance company subsidiary paid hcc a million dividend  as approved by the maryland insurance administration 
the funds were then contributed to another insurance company subsidiary 
our million revolving loan facility allows us to borrow up to the maximum allowed by the facility on a revolving basis until the facility expires on november  the facility is collateralized in part by the pledge of our insurance companies stock and guarantees entered into by our underwriting agencies and reinsurance brokers 
the facility agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  which we believe are typical for similar financing arrangements 
at december   certain of our subsidiaries maintained revolving lines of credit with a bank in the combined maximum amount of million available through november  advances under the lines of credit are limited to amounts required to fund draws  if any  on letters of credit issued by the bank on behalf of the subsidiaries and short term direct cash advances 
the lines of credit are collateralized by securities having an aggregate market value of up to million  the actual amount of collateral at any one time being of the aggregate amount outstanding 
interest on the lines is payable at the bank s prime rate of interest at december  for draws on the letters of credit and either prime or prime less on short term cash advances 
at december   letters of credit totaling million had been issued to insurance companies by the bank on behalf of our subsidiaries  with total securities of million collateralizing the lines 
we have filed registration statements with the united states securities and exchange commission that provide a shelf registration for an aggregate of million of our securities  of which we have million available to be issued 
these securities may be debt securities  equity securities or a combination thereof 
we sold million shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter of under this shelf registration at a price of per share 
we used the net proceeds of million to make a million capital contribution to one of our insurance company subsidiaries and million to pay down bank debt 
our debt to capital ratio was at december  and at december  we believe that our operating cash flows  investments  bank facility and shelf registration will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation our operations  like those of other property and casualty insurers  are susceptible to the effects of inflation  as premiums are established before the ultimate amounts of loss and loss adjustment expense are known 
although we consider the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates  for competitive reasons  such premiums may not fully offset the effects of inflation 
however  because the majority of our business is comprised of lines which have relatively short lead times between the occurrence of an insured 
table of contents event  reporting of the claims to us and the final settlement of the claims  the effects of inflation are minimized 
a portion of our revenue is related to healthcare insurance and reinsurance products that are subject to the effects of the underlying inflation of healthcare costs 
such inflation in the costs of healthcare tends to generate increases in premiums for medical stop loss coverage  resulting in greater revenue  but also higher claim payments 
inflation also may have a negative impact on insurance and reinsurance operations by causing higher claim settlements than may originally have been estimated  without an immediate increase in premiums to a level necessary to maintain profit margins 
we do not specifically provide for inflation when setting underwriting terms and claim reserves  although we do consider trends 
we continually review claim reserves to assess their adequacy and make necessary adjustments 
inflation can also affect interest rates 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our investments 
in addition  the interest rate payable under our million revolving loan facility fluctuates with market interest rates 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings  depending on the amount borrowed on our bank facility 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations we underwrite risks which are denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
as a result  we have receivables and payables in foreign currencies and we establish and maintain loss reserves with respect to our insurance policies in their respective currencies 
our net earnings could be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations affecting these balances 
our principal area of exposure is related to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the british pound sterling  the euro and the us dollar 
we constantly monitor the balance between our receivables and payables and loss reserves to mitigate the potential exposure should an imbalance be expected to exist for other than a short period of time 
our gain from currency conversion was million in compared to million in and million in included in the amount was a one time gain of million from the settlement of an advance of funds to an unaffiliated entity 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions when applying our accounting policies 
the following sections provide information about our estimation processes related to certain of our critical accounting policies 
loss and loss adjustment expense our net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are composed of reserves for reported losses and reserves for incurred but not reported losses  less a reduction for reinsurance recoverables related to those reserves 
reserves are recorded by product line and are undiscounted  except for reserves related to acquisitions recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
the reserves for reported losses related to our direct business and certain reinsurance assumed are initially set by our claims personnel or independent claims adjusters we retain 
the reserves are subject to our review  with a goal of setting them at the ultimate expected loss amount as soon as possible when the information becomes available 
reserves for reported losses related to other reinsurance assumed are recorded based on information supplied to us by the ceding company 
our claims personnel monitor these reinsurance assumed reserves on a current basis and audit ceding companies claims to ascertain that claims are being recorded currently and that net reserves are being set at levels that properly reflect the liability related to the claims 
our actuaries  in conjunction with our claims personnel  estimate the amount of our incurred but not reported reserves  which include an estimate for losses that have occurred but have not been actually 
table of contents reported to us  as well as an estimate of potential development in outstanding claim reserves 
when there is the possibility that information related to reserves may be reported late or where there is the possibility that claims may take a long time to develop  our actuaries estimates are based on our historical trends in paid and incurred losses or  if we do not have enough history  on industry trends and factors 
these estimates take into consideration that claims or information related to outstanding claims can be reported late or be slow in developing  especially with respect to assumed reinsurance because it takes an extended time for cedants to gather and report information and for certain insolvent cedants  especially when their claims are being administered by state authorities or guarantee associations 
our actuaries utilize standard actuarial techniques in making their reserve determinations 
these techniques may require a high degree of judgment 
reserves are estimates  and changed conditions can cause changes in the estimates 
however  we believe that our review process is effective  such that any required changes are recognized in the period of change as soon as the need for the change is evident 
reinsurance recoverables offset our gross reserves based on the contractual terms of our reinsurance agreements 
with the exception of when we had negative development principally in the reserves related to our discontinued line of business  our net reserves have historically shown positive development except for the effects of losses on commutations which we have completed in the past and may negotiate in the future 
commutations can produce negative prior year development since  for generally accepted accounting principles purposes  any excess of undiscounted reserves assumed over assets received must be recorded as a loss at the time the commutation is effected 
however  economically  the loss generally represents the time value of money discount that will be earned over the payout of the undiscounted reserves  thus  the loss may be recouped as investment income is earned on the assets received 
based on our reserving techniques and our past results  we believe that any future negative development will not have a material impact on our consolidated net reserves or net earnings

we have insignificant exposure to asbestos and environmental losses  since we did not begin business until and the type of business we wrote contained pollution exclusions or did not subject us to asbestos or environmental risks 
the table below shows our recorded net reserves at december  by line of business  the actuarial reserve point estimate  and the high and low ends of the actuarial reserve range as determined by our reserving actuaries 
the point estimates represent our actuaries estimate of the most likely amount that will ultimately be paid to settle the net reserves we have recorded at a particular point in time 
while  from an actuarial standpoint  a point estimate is considered the most likely amount to be paid  there is 
table of contents inherent uncertainty in the point estimate  and it can be thought of as the expected value in a distribution of possible reserve estimates 
the actuarial ranges represent our actuaries estimate of a likely lowest amount and highest amount that will ultimately be paid to settle the net reserves we have recorded at a particular point in time 
while there is still a possibility of ultimately paying an amount below the range or above the range  the actuarial probability is very small 
the range determinations are based on estimates and actuarial judgments and are intended to encompass reasonably likely changes in one or more of the variables that were used to determine the point estimates 
in actuarial practice  some of our lines of business are more effectively modeled by a statistical distribution that is skewed or non symmetric 
these distributions are usually skewed towards large losses  which causes the midpoint of the range to be above the actuarial point estimate or mean value of the range 
this should be kept in mind when using the midpoint as a proxy for the mean 
the assumptions  estimates and judgments can change based on new information and changes in conditions and  if they change  it will affect the determination of the range amounts 
we utilize the work of our actuaries together with input from our underwriting and claims personnel and other factors in setting loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
we utilize the point and range estimates to monitor the adequacy of our reserves 
generally  we maintain our total net reserves above the actuarial point estimate 
recorded actuarial low end of high end of net reserves point estimate actuarial range actuarial range total net reserves individual lines of business group life  accident and health diversified financial products london market account aviation other specialty lines discontinued lines total net reserves the low end of the actuarial range and the high end of the actuarial range for the total net reserves will not equal the sum of the low and high ends for the individual lines of business 
moreover  in actuarial terms  it would not be appropriate to add the ranges for each line of business to obtain a range around the total net reserves because this would not reflect the diversification effects across our various lines of business 
the diversification effects result from the fact that losses across the different lines of business are not completely correlated 
we determine our incurred but not reported reserves by first projecting the ultimate expected losses by product within each line of business 
we then subtract paid losses and outstanding loss reserves from the ultimate loss reserves 
the remainder is our incurred but not reported reserves 
the level of incurred but not reported reserves in relation to total reserves depends upon the characteristics of the particular line of business  particularly with respect to the speed by which losses are reported and outstanding claims reserves are adjusted 
lines for which losses are reported fast will have a lower percentage incurred but not reported reserve than slower reporting lines  and lines for which reserve volatility is low will have a lower percentage incurred but not reported loss reserve than high volatility lines

table of contents the percentage of net incurred but not reported reserves to net total reserves decreased from at december  to at december  as the business matured and losses were reported 
the reasons for the significant decreases by line of business were total reserves in our diversified financial products line of business increased million from to as this relatively new line of business continues to grow 
the incurred but not reported portion of the total reserves for this line of business are higher than in most of our other lines  since these losses report slower and have a longer duration 
total reserves in our london market account increased million and the percentage of incurred but not reported reserves declined from to  due to reported claims for the hurricanes 
total net reserves for our discontinued lines  which primarily include accident and health business  increased million in the percentage of net incurred but not reported reserves to total reserves for discontinued lines decreased to as claims continued to be reported 
as a result of adverse development in our discontinued line of business  we strengthened our reserves on this line to bring them above our actuarial point estimate 
reinsurance recoverables certain reinsurers have delayed or suspended payment of amounts recoverable under reinsurance contracts to which we are a party 
we limit our liquidity exposure for uncollected recoverables by holding funds  letters of credit or other security  such that net balances due are significantly less than the gross balances shown in our balance sheets 
we constantly monitor the collectibility of the reinsurance recoverables of our insurance companies and record a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance when we determine an amount is potentially uncollectible 
our evaluation is based on our periodic reviews of our disputed and aged recoverables  as well as our assessment of recoverables due from reinsurers known to be in financial difficulty 
in some cases  we make estimates as to what portion of a recoverable may be uncollectible 
our estimates and judgment about the collectibility of the recoverables and the financial condition of reinsurers can change  and these changes can affect the level of reserve required 
the reserve was million at december   compared to million at december  we increased the reserve in by million to cover additional recoverables for which changed conditions caused us to believe that part or all of the outstanding balances may not be collectible 
amounts charged against the reserve in and were immaterial 
we are currently in negotiations with most reinsurers who have delayed or suspended payments  but if such negotiations do not result in a satisfactory resolution  we may seek or be involved in litigation or arbitration 
in some cases  the final resolution of such disputes through arbitration or litigation may extend over several years 
at december   our insurance companies have million  mostly in excess of one year old  that has not been paid to us under contracts subject to arbitration proceedings that we initiated 
we estimate there could be up to an additional million of incurred losses and loss expenses and other balances due under the subject contracts 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on our history of earnings  expectations for future earnings  taxable income in carry back years and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  with the exception of the benefit of certain pre acquisition tax loss carryforwards for which valuation allowances have been provided 
if there is a material change in the tax laws such that the actual effective tax rate changes or the time periods within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible change  we will need to reevaluate our assumptions  which could result in a change in the valuation allowance required 

table of contents valuation of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or sooner if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in determining the fair value of a reporting unit  we utilize the expected cash flow approach in statement of financial accounting concepts con  using cash flow information and present values in accounting measurements 
this approach utilizes a risk free rate of interest  estimates of future cash flows and probabilities as to the occurrence of the future cash flows 
we utilize our budgets and projection of future operations based on historical and expected industry trends to estimate our future cash flows and the probability of their occurring as projected 
based on our latest impairment test  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying amount by a satisfactory margin 
other than temporary impairments on investments declines in the market value of invested assets below cost are evaluated for other than temporary impairment losses on a quarterly basis 
impairment losses for declines in value of fixed maturity investments below cost attributable to issuer specific events are based on all relevant facts and circumstances for each investment and are recognized when appropriate 
for fixed maturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry related events where we have the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity  declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary 
at december   we had gross unrealized losses on fixed income securities of million of aggregate market value compared to million of aggregate market value at december  the following table displays the gross unrealized losses and fair value of our fixed income securities at december  that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for the periods indicated in thousands less than months months or more total fair unrealized fair unrealized fair unrealized value losses value losses value losses us treasury securities obligations of states  municipalities and political subdivisions corporate fixed income securities asset backed and mortgage backed securities foreign securities total fixed income securities recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance with respect to the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method 
in september  the fasb issued a staff position  fsp eitf issue  delaying the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance included in eitf  and also issued an exposure draft  fsp eitf issue a  which proposes guidance relating to debt securities that 
table of contents are impaired because of interest rate and or sector spread increases 
the delay in the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance of eitf did not suspend existing requirements for assessing whether investment impairments are other than temporary 
it is expected that the proposed guidance under fsp eitf issue a will be finalized in we are monitoring the outcome of the eitf s consideration of these issues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal assets and liabilities are financial instruments which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed income securities and variable rate debt  and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
caution should be used in evaluating overall market risk utilizing the information below 
actual results could differ materially from estimates below for a variety of reasons  including  among other things amounts and balances on which the estimates are based are likely to change over time  assumptions used in the models may prove to be inaccurate  market changes could be different from market changes assumed below  and not all factors and balances are taken into account 
interest rate risk to manage the exposures of our investment risks  we generally invest in investment grade securities with characteristics of duration and liquidity to reflect the underlying characteristics of the insurance liabilities of our insurance companies 
we have not used derivatives to manage any of our investment related market risks 
the value of our portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in the market interest rates 
in addition  some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of the portfolio will mature at any point in time 
the fair value of our fixed income securities was billion at december  and billion at december  if market interest rates were to change eg from to  the fair value of our fixed income securities would have changed approximately million at december  this compares to change in value of million at december  for the same change in market interest rates 
the change in fair value was determined using duration modeling assuming no prepayments 
our million revolving loan facility is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on this loan is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december  and  there was no balance outstanding under our bank loan 
our and convertible notes are not subject to interest rate changes 

table of contents foreign exchange risk the table below shows the net amounts of significant foreign currency balances for subsidiaries with a us dollar functional currency at december  and converted to us dollars 
it also shows the expected dollar change in fair value in thousands that would occur if exchange rates changed from exchange rates in effect at those times
