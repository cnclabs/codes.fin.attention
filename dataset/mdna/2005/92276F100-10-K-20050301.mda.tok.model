this management s discussion and analysis will help you understand key transactions that we completed in  our critical accounting policies and estimates  accounting policies that we adopted in  and  our results of operations for the last three years  our liquidity and capital resources  and our funds from operations 
key transactions in during  we completed the following key transactions we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of eldertrust in a cash transaction valued at million  inclusive of million in unrestricted and restricted cash  we acquired facilities now leased by affiliates of brookdale living communities  inc for a purchase price of million  we acquired an additional facilities from various sellers for an aggregate purchase price of million  we issued million of unsecured senior notes  maturing on october   we obtained a new million secured revolving credit facility initially priced at basis points over libor  an improvement over our previous revolving credit facility which was initially priced at basis points over libor  and we raised million of equity with the public sale of two million shares of our common stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements

index to financial statements long lived assets investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method 
the cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible land  buildings and equipment and recognized intangibles based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
we estimate fair values of the components of assets acquired as of the acquisition date or engage a third party appraiser as necessary 
recognized intangibles  if any  include the value of acquired lease contracts and related customer relationships 
our method for determining fair value varies with the categorization of the asset acquired 
we estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis  and amortize the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building 
we determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and amortize such value over their estimated remaining useful lives 
we determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset  internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or third party appraisals 
the fair value of in place leases  if any  reflects i above and below market leases  if any  determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals  the resulting intangible asset of which is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods  if applicable  ii the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants  including tenant allowances  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease  and iii an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period  as if the acquired space was vacant  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease 
we also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with such tenant  such tenant s credit quality  expectations of lease renewals with such tenant  and the potential for significant  additional future leasing arrangements with such tenant 
we amortize such value  if any  over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases  which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  primarily consisting of our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than book value 
an impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such adjustment 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
revenue recognition certain of our leases  excluding our master lease agreements the kindred master leases with kindred healthcare  inc and certain of its affiliates collectively  kindred  provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent 
base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
certain of our other leases  including the kindred master leases  provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other contingencies are met 
we recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
we recognize income from rent  lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin i the agreement has been fully executed and delivered  ii services have been rendered  iii the amount is fixed or determinable  and iv the collectibility is reasonably assured

index to financial statements legal contingencies we are involved in litigation as described in note litigation of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate such matters by i ascertaining the probability that such litigation could result in a loss for us and ii determining an estimate of any possible loss 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue for any probable losses that are estimable and disclose any loss contingencies that are possible 
if management s assessment of our liability with respect to these actions is incorrect  such matters could have a material adverse effect on us 
fair value of derivative instruments the valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
fair values for our derivatives are verified with a third party consultant which utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and discount rates 
such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the financial statements are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future

pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under sfas no 
r 
as required under sfas no 
r  we expect to adopt the provisions of this accounting standard on july  we expect to apply the modified prospective method of adoption in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the date we adopt the accounting standard for all share based payments granted after the adoption date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date that remain unvested on the adoption date 
as permitted by sfas no 
r  we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to result in an immaterial increase in expense during the second half of based on unvested options outstanding as of december  and current compensation plans 
while the effect of adoption depends on the level of share based payments granted in the future and unvested grants on the date we adopt sfas no

funds from operations our funds from operations ffo for the five years ended december  are summarized in the following table for the year ended december  in thousands net income loss adjustments depreciation on real estate assets realized gain on sale of real estate assets other items discontinued operations real estate depreciation discontinued gain on sale of real estate funds from operations historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
to overcome this problem  we consider ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit  and we use the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is ffo necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
asset liability management asset liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program 
the objective of asset liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels 
the asset liability management process focuses on a variety of risks  including market risk primarily interest rate risk and credit risk 
effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of ffo and net worth 
the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
market risk we receive revenue primarily by leasing our assets under leases that are long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
we also earn revenue from the thi mezzanine loan 
our obligations under our revolving credit facility are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in libor 
the general fixed nature of our assets and the variable nature of our obligations create interest rate risk 
if interest rates were to rise significantly  our lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet our debt obligations 
in order to mitigate this risk  on september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between july  and june  the swap 
the swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and is with a highly rated counterparty on which we pay a fixed rate of and receive libor from the counterparty 
on december   due to our lower expected future variable debt balances  we reduced the notional amount of the swap for the period from december  through june  from million to million 
see note borrowing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there are no collateral requirements under the swap 
the notional amount of the swap is scheduled to decline from million as follows notional amount date june  june  june  to highlight the sensitivity of the interest rate swap and fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates  the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  and in thousands as of december  swap fixed rate debt swap fixed rate debt notional amount  n a  n a book value n a  n a  fair value a fair value reflecting change in interest rates a bps bps 
table of contents 
index to financial statements a the change in fair value of the swap was due to the general increase in interest rates 
the change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due to i the assumption of approximately million in fixed rate debt as a result of our eldertrust merger and acquisitions during  the fair value of which approximated book value at december   ii the issuance of million in senior notes as defined below in october  the fair value of which was approximately million at december   and iii general increase in interest rates 
n a not applicable 
we paid million under the swap during the year ended december  assuming that interest rates do not change  we estimate that we will pay approximately million on the swap during the year ending december the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value 
there is no cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates because we currently hedge of our variable rate debt 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt is million  which is based on open market trading activity provided by a third party for our senior notes and based on rates offered for similar arrangements for our mortgage indebtedness 
credit risk as a result of our spin off of kindred in  we have a significant concentration of credit risk with kindred under the kindred master leases 
for the years ended december  and  kindred accounted for million  or of our total revenues  and  or of our total revenues  respectively 
accordingly  kindred s financial condition and ability to meet our rent obligations will largely determine our rental revenues and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  any failure by kindred to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities 
see risk factors risks arising from our business we are dependent on kindred  kindred s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a reit included in part i  item of this annual report on form k and note concentration of credit risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we monitor our credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by  among other things  i reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally  publicly available information regarding tenants  and information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements  and ii having periodic discussions with tenants  borrowers and their representatives 
liquidity and capital resources during  our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from equity and debt issuances  cash flow from operations  borrowings under revolving credit facilities and disposition of real estate assets  proceeds from stock option exercises  and proceeds from the distribution reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations  dividends to shareholders and debt amortization 
capital requirements for acquisitions may require funding from borrowings  assumption of debt from the seller  issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities or equity offerings 
we intend to continue to fund future investments through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  disposition of assets and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities

dividends in order to continue to qualify as a reit  we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least of reit taxable income excluding net capital gain 
we declared dividends greater than of estimated taxable income for and intend to pay a dividend greater than of taxable income for we expect that reit taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing reit taxable income 
although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirement  it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation 
if we do not have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirement  or if we desire to retain cash  we may borrow funds  issue additional equity securities  pay taxable stock dividends  if possible  distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements 
capital expenditures and property acquisitions except with respect to our medical office buildings  capital expenditures to maintain and improve the leased properties generally will be incurred by our tenants 
accordingly  we do not believe that we will incur any major expenditures in connection with the leased properties 
after the expiration of the leases  or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the leases  we anticipate that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of leased properties for which we may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings 
to the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required  our liquidity may be affected adversely 
our ability to make expenditures and borrow funds is restricted by the terms of our revolving credit facility and the senior notes
