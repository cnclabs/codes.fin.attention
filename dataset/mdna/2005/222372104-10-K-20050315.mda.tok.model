item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview countrywide s core business is residential mortgage banking 
in recent years  we have expanded from our core mortgage banking business into related businesses 
we have pursued this diversification to capitalize on meaningful opportunities to leverage our core mortgage banking business and to provide sources of earnings that are less cyclical than the mortgage banking business 
we manage these businesses through five business segments mortgage banking  banking  capital markets  insurance and global operations 
the mortgage banking business continues to be the primary source of our revenues and earnings 
as a result  the primary influence on our operating results is the aggregate demand for mortgage loans in the us  which is affected by such external factors as prevailing mortgage rates and the strength of the us housing market 
in  total us residential mortgage production declined from s record setting market to an estimated trillion 
this decline was largely attributable to a decline in mortgage refinance activity caused by interest rates rising from the historically low levels reached in this change in the direction and level of interest rates notwithstanding  our mortgage banking operations achieved their second best annual performance in  as the reduction in mortgage loan production resulting from higher interest rates was partially offset by an increase in market share 
during  we became the largest originator of mortgage loans increasing our market share from to source of mortgage market mortgage bankers association 
this mortgage banking performance was bolstered by increased profits from our diversified businesses  in particular the banking segment 
as a result our net earnings reached  million in  a decrease of million  or  from for  forecasters predict a to reduction in total us mortgage production  due to an expected continuation in the decline in mortgage refinance activity 
we believe that a market within the forecasted range would still be conducive to a profitable loan production business  although we would expect increased competitive pressures to impact the profits earned by that business 
a reduction in mortgage refinance activity should result  however  in an increase in profitability from our investment in mortgage servicing rights msrs 
we also expect that a decline in mortgage production would result in a reduction in mortgage securities trading and underwriting volume  which may negatively impact the profitability of our capital markets segment 
we plan to grow our investment in mortgage loans at the bank irrespective of the mortgage market 
as a result  we expect earnings in our banking segment to increase 
the principal market risk we face is interest rate risk the risk that the value of our assets or liabilities or our net interest income will change due to changes in interest rates 
we manage this risk primarily through the natural counterbalance of our loan production operations and our investment in msrs  as well as through the use of various financial instruments including derivatives 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management activities is to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in interest rates 
we also face credit risk  primarily related to our residential mortgage production activities 
credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or an institution to honor its contractual obligations to us 
we manage mortgage credit risk principally by selling substantially all of the mortgage loans that we produce  limiting credit recourse to countrywide in those transactions  and by retaining high credit quality mortgages in our loan portfolio 
our liquidity and financing requirements are significant 
we meet these requirements in a variety of ways  including use of the public corporate debt and equity markets  mortgage and asset backed securities markets  and  increasingly  through the financing activities of our bank 
the objective of our liquidity management is to ensure that adequate  diverse and reliable sources of cash are available to meet our funding needs on a cost effective basis 
our ability to raise financing at the level and cost required to compete effectively is dependent on maintaining our high credit standing 
the mortgage industry has undergone rapid consolidation in recent years  and we expect this trend to continue in the future 
today the industry is dominated by large  sophisticated financial institutions 
to compete effectively in the future  we will be required to maintain a high level of operational  technological and managerial expertise  as well as an ability to attract capital at a competitive cost 
we believe that we will benefit from industry consolidation through increased market share and rational price competition 
countrywide is a diversified financial services company with mortgage banking at its core 
our goal is to continue as the leader in the mortgage banking business 
we plan to leverage our position in mortgage banking to grow our related businesses 
as used in this report  references to we  our  the company or countrywide refer to countrywide financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies with the greatest impact on our financial condition and results of operations  and which require the most judgment  pertain to our mortgage securitization activities  our investments in msrs and other retained interests  and our use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
our critical accounting policies involve the following three areas accounting for gains on sales of loans and securities  accounting for msrs and other retained interests  including valuation of these retained interests  and accounting for derivatives and our related interest rate risk management activities 
gain on sale of loans and securities substantially all of the mortgage loans we produce are sold in the secondary mortgage market  primarily in the form of securities and to a lesser extent as whole loans 
when we sell loans in the secondary mortgage market we generally retain the msrs 
depending on the type of securitization  there may be other interests we retain including interest only securities  principal only securities and residual securities 
we determine the gain on sale of a security or loans by allocating the carrying value of the underlying mortgage loans between securities or loans sold and the interests retained  based on their relative estimated fair values 
the gain on sale we report is the difference between the cash proceeds from the sale and the cost allocated to the securities or loans sold 
the timing of such gain recognition is dependent on meeting very specific accounting criteria and  as a result  the gain on sale may be recorded in a different accounting period from when the securitization was completed 
here is an example of how this accounting works carrying value of mortgage loans underlying a security fair values security retained interests total fair value computation of gain on sale of security sales proceeds less cost allocated to security  x  gain on sale initial recorded value of retained interests   the carrying value of mortgage loans includes the outstanding principal balance of the loans  net of deferred origination costs and fees and any premiums or discounts 
accounting for msrs and other retained interests once msrs have been recorded  they must be periodically evaluated for impairment 
impairment occurs when the current fair value of the msrs falls below the asset s carrying value 
we stratify our msrs by predominate risk characteristic when evaluating for impairment 
if msrs are impaired  the impairment is recognized in current period earnings and the carrying value of the msrs is adjusted through a valuation allowance 
if the value of the msrs subsequently increases  the recovery in value is recognized in current period earnings and the carrying value of the msrs is adjusted through a reduction in the valuation allowance 
as of december   the msr impairment valuation allowance was billion 
if impairment is deemed to be other than temporary  the valuation allowance is applied to reduce the cost basis of the msrs 
absent hedge accounting  msrs cannot be carried above their amortized cost basis 
msrs are also subject to periodic amortization 
we compute msr amortization by applying the ratio of the net msr cash flows projected for the current period to the estimated total remaining net msr cash flows 
the estimated total net msr cash flows are determined at the beginning of each reporting period  using prepayment assumptions applicable at that time 
we account for other retained interests recognized before july   as available for sale securities 
for these investments  impairment is recognized as a reduction to shareholders equity net of tax 
if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary  it is recognized in current period earnings 
once we record this impairment  we recognize subsequent increases in the value of these other retained interests in earnings over the estimated remaining life of the investment through a higher effective yield 
other retained interests recognized on or after july   are accounted for as trading securities with all changes in estimated fair value recognized in current period earnings 
valuation of msrs and other retained interests considerable judgment is required to determine the fair values of our retained interests 
unlike government securities and other highly liquid investments  the precise market value of retained interests cannot be readily determined because these assets are not actively traded in stand alone markets 
our msr valuation process combines the use of a sophisticated discounted cash flow model and extensive analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value at each balance sheet date 
senior financial management exercises extensive and active oversight of this process 
the cash flow assumptions and prepayment assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model are based on our empirical data drawn from the historical performance of our msrs  which we believe are consistent with assumptions used by market participants valuing similar msrs 
the key assumptions used in the valuation of msrs include mortgage prepayment speeds and the discount rate projected libor plus option adjusted spread 
these variables can  and generally will  change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change 
we assess the reasonableness of our msr valuation quarterly by comparison to the following market data as available msr trades  msr broker valuations  prices of interest only securities  and peer group msr valuation surveys 
for our other retained interests  we also estimate fair value through the use of discounted cash flow models 
the key assumptions used in the valuation of our other retained interests include mortgage prepayment speeds  discount rates  and for residual interests containing credit risk  the net lifetime credit losses 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk management section in this report for further discussion of credit risk 
we develop cash flow and prepayment assumptions based on our own empirical data drawn from the historical performance of the loans underlying our other retained interests  which we believe are consistent with assumptions that other major market participants would use in determining the assets fair value 
the following table shows the key assumptions we used to determine the fair values of our msrs at december   and the value sensitivity of our msrs to changes in such assumptions 
msrs dollar amounts in thousands fair value of msrs carrying value of msrs carrying value as a percentage of msr portfolio weighted average service fee weighted average life in years multiple of net service fee weighted average annual prepayment speed impact of adverse change impact of adverse change weighted average oas impact of adverse change impact of adverse change option adjusted spread over libor 
the yield implied in the market value of the msrs was at december  the following table shows the key assumptions we used to determine the fair values of our other retained interests at december   and the value sensitivity of our other retained interests to changes in such assumptions 
other retained interests dollar amounts in thousands fair value of retained interests weighted average life in years weighted average annual prepayment speed impact of adverse change impact of adverse change weighted average annual discount rate impact of adverse change impact of adverse change weighted average net lifetime credit losses impact of adverse change impact of adverse change these sensitivities are solely for illustrative purposes and should be used with caution 
this information is furnished to provide the reader with a basis for assessing the sensitivity of the values presented to changes in key assumptions 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a variation in individual assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated 
in addition  in the above tables  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interests is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may coincide with changes in another  which could compound or counteract the sensitivities 
derivatives and interest rate risk management activities we use derivatives extensively in connection with our interest rate risk management activities 
we record all derivative instruments at fair value 
we may qualify some of our interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting 
a primary requirement to qualify for hedge accounting is the demonstration on an ongoing basis that our interest rate risk management activity is highly effective 
we use standard statistical measures to determine the effectiveness of our hedging activity 
if we are unable to  or choose not to  qualify certain interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting  then the change in fair value of the associated derivative financial instruments is reflected in current period earnings  while the change in fair value of the related asset or liability may not  thus creating a possible earnings mismatch 
this issue is potentially most significant regarding msrs  which absent the application of hedge accounting  are required to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or market 
in connection with our mortgage loan origination activities  we issue interest rate lock commitments irlcs to loan applicants and financial intermediaries 
the irlcs guarantee a loan s terms  subject to credit approval  for a period typically between seven and days 
irlcs are derivative instruments and  therefore  are required to be recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value reflected in current period earnings 
however  unlike most other derivative instruments  there is no active market for irlcs that can be used to determine an irlc s fair value 
consequently  we have developed a method for estimating the fair value of our irlcs 
we estimate the fair value of an irlc based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan  adjusted for the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc 
the change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is based on quoted mbs prices 
the change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is measured from the date we issue the commitment 
therefore  at the time of issuance the estimated fair value of an irlc is zero 
subsequent to issuance  the value of an irlc can be either positive or negative  depending on the change in value of the underlying mortgage loan 
the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc is influenced by a number of factors in particular  the change  if any  in mortgage rates subsequent to the lock date 
in general  the probability of funding increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall 
this is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicant s committed rate 
the probability that a loan will fund within the terms of the irlc also is influenced by the source of the application  age of the application  purpose for the loan purchase or refinance and the application approval rate 
we have developed closing ratio estimates using historical empirical data that take into account all of these variables  as well as renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall 
these closing ratio estimates are used to calculate the number of loans that we expect to fund within the terms of the irlcs

in addition  in the fourth quarter of the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 which required the company to include the assumed conversion of its convertible debentures in diluted earnings per share 
all references in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to the number of common shares and earnings per share amounts have been adjusted accordingly 
results of operations comparison year ended december   and year ended december  consolidated earnings performance net earnings were  million during  a decrease from the decrease in our earnings was driven primarily by a decrease in the profitability of our mortgage banking segment 
the mortgage banking segment produced pre tax earnings of  million for  a decrease of from in the mortgage banking segment  improved financial performance of our msrs was more than offset by a decline in the profitability of our loan production sector 
although net earnings decreased from prior year  earnings per share for decreased to as a result of an increase in the average number of diluted shares outstanding during the period 
loan production sector pre tax earnings were  million for  a decrease of  million from the prior year 
the decrease in the profitability of the loan production sector resulted from lower prime mortgage loan production and sales combined with a compression in margins  which was caused by generally higher mortgage interest rates  increased borrower demand for lower margin adjustable rate mortgages  greater pricing competition  and  higher loan origination costs 
production sector profitability in was bolstered by increased sales of higher margin nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans 
the pre tax loss in the loan servicing sector  which incorporates the performance of our msrs and other retained interests  was million  an improvement of million from the year ago period 
the reduced pre tax loss was primarily attributable to a decrease in the combined amount of amortization and impairment  net of servicing hedge losses gains  which totaled  million in  compared to  million in the year ago period 
profits from our diversified businesses were up significantly in in particular  our banking segment increased its pre tax earnings by million from the year ago period  primarily as the result of increases in the balance of mortgage loans held by treasury bank 
in total  diversified businesses contributed  million in pre tax earnings for  an increase of from the year ago period 
operating segment results pre tax earnings by segment are summarized below years ended december  in thousands mortgage banking loan production loan servicing loan closing services total mortgage banking diversified businesses banking capital markets insurance global operations other total diversified businesses pre tax earnings the pre tax earnings of each segment include intercompany transactions  which are eliminated in the other category above 
mortgage loan production by segment and product is summarized below years ended december  in millions segment mortgage banking capital markets conduit acquisitions banking treasury bank product prime mortgage nonprime mortgage prime home equity mortgage banking segment the mortgage banking segment includes the loan production  loan servicing and loan closing services sectors 
the loan production and loan closing services sectors generally perform at their best when mortgage rates are relatively low and loan origination volume is high 
conversely  the loan servicing sector generally performs well when mortgage rates are relatively high and loan prepayments are low 
the natural counterbalance of these sectors reduces the impact of changes in mortgage rates on our earnings 
loan production sector the loan production sector produces mortgage loans through the four production divisions of countrywide home loans chl consumer markets  wholesale lending  correspondent lending and full spectrum lending 
full spectrum lending  inc was a subsidiary of cfc until it merged with chl in december the pre tax earnings of the loan production sector are summarized below years ended december  percentage of percentage of loan production loan production amount volume amount volume dollar amounts in thousands revenues prime mortgage nonprime mortgage prime home equity total revenues expenses compensation expenses other operating expenses allocated corporate expenses total expenses pre tax earnings decreased demand for residential mortgages from the historic levels experienced in resulted in lower production volume in the resulting decline in our production was moderated by an increase in our market share from the year ago period 
our mortgage loan production market share was in  up from in source of mortgage market mortgage bankers association 
revenues declined over the prior year due primarily to a reduction in production and sales volumes and to decreased margins on prime mortgage loans 
sales of prime mortgage loans were billion in the current period compared to billion in the prior year 
we attribute the decline in margins on prime mortgage loans to increased price competition caused by the significant reduction in refinance activity  as well as to the shift in consumer preference towards adjustable rate mortgages  which generally carry lower margins than year fixed rate mortgages 
the decline in prime mortgage loan revenues was partially offset by increased production and sales of higher margin nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans 
combined sales of nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loan products were billion in compared to billion in the increase in total revenues as a percentage of loan volume in is attributable to a shift in mix toward nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans  which generally have higher revenues  as a percentage of the loan balance  than prime mortgage loans 
operating expenses increased  both in dollars and in proportion to loan production volume  compared to the prior year 
expenses increased primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing costs and to a general reduction in productivity from the very high levels achieved during the peak of refinance activity in the increase in sales and marketing costs were related to increased production in of purchase prime mortgage loans  nonprime mortgage loans and prime home equity loans  as well as to an increase in the percentage of total loans produced through our retail channels 
we continued to expand our loans production operations in despite a decline in the overall market to support our long term objective of market share growth 
mortgage banking loan production volume for decreased in comparison to non purchase loan production declined by  while purchase production increased by 
the increase in purchase loans is significant because this component of the mortgage market offers relatively stable growth  averaging per year over the last years 
the non purchase  or refinance  component of the mortgage market is highly volatile because it is driven almost exclusively by prevailing mortgage rates 
the following table summarizes mortgage banking loan production by purpose and by interest rate type years ended december  in millions purpose purchase non purchase interest rate type fixed rate adjustable rate in  of our loan production was adjustable rate in comparison to in the shift in homeowner preferences toward adjustable rate mortgages in was driven by an increase in year fixed mortgage rates  coupled with the availability of attractive product alternatives such as hybrid adjustable rate and short term pay option adjustable rate mortgages that provide a relatively low fixed rate for the first three to ten years of the mortgage 
the volume of mortgage banking prime home equity and nonprime mortgage loans produced which is included in our total volume of loans produced increased during the current period from the prior period 
details are shown in the following table 
years ended december  dollar amounts in millions prime home equity loans nonprime mortgage loans percent of total mortgage banking loan production prime home equity and nonprime mortgage loans generally provide higher profit margins  and the demand for such loans is believed to be less interest rate sensitive than the demand for prime mortgage loans 
consequently  we believe these loans will be a significant component of the loan production sector s future profitability  in particular if mortgage rates continue to rise 
during  the loan production sector operated at approximately of planned operational capacity  compared to during the year ago period 
the primary capacity constraint in our loan origination activities is the number of loan operations personnel we have on staff 
therefore  we measure planned capacity with reference to the number of our loan operations personnel multiplied by the number of loans we expect each loan operations staff person to process under normal conditions 
as loan production volume has declined  there has been a reduction in productivity to more sustainable levels that has resulted in higher overall unit costs 
we plan to continue building our sales staff despite a potential further drop in loan origination volume as a primary means to increase our market share  particularly for purchase loans 
the following table summarizes the number of people included in the loan production sector workforce workforce at december  sales operations regular employees temporary staff production technology administration and support total loan production sector workforce the following table shows total mortgage banking loan production volume by division years ended december  in millions correspondent lending consumer markets wholesale lending full spectrum lending the commissioned sales force of the consumer markets division numbered  at december   an increase of  or compared to december  the commissioned sales force contributed billion in purchase originations during  a increase over the year ago period 
the purchase production generated by the commissioned sales force represented of the consumer markets division s purchase production for in addition  the consumer markets division has expanded its branch network to branch offices at december   an increase of offices over the year ago period 
the wholesale lending division and full spectrum lending division also continued to grow their sales forces as a means to increase market share 
at december   the sales force in the wholesale lending division numbered  an increase of compared to december  the full spectrum lending division expanded its sales force by  or  compared to december   and has expanded its branch network to branch offices at december   an increase of offices over the prior year 
loan servicing sector the loan servicing sector includes a significant processing operation  consisting of approximately  employees who service our million mortgage loans 
also included in the loan servicing sector s results is the performance of our investments in msrs and other retained interests and associated risk management activities  as well as profits from subservicing activities in the united states 
the long term performance of this sector is impacted primarily by the level of interest rates and the corresponding impact on the level of projected and actual prepayments in our servicing portfolio 
the following table summarizes the results for the loan servicing sector years ended december  percentage of percentage of average average servicing servicing amount portfolio amount portfolio dollar amounts in thousands servicing fees  net of guarantee fees miscellaneous fees income from other retained interests escrow balance expense amortization of mortgage servicing rights impairment of retained interests servicing hedge losses gains total servicing revenues operating expenses allocated corporate expenses total servicing expenses interest expense pre tax loss average servicing portfolio volume the pre tax loss in the loan servicing sector was million during  an improvement of million from the prior year 
during the current year  mortgage rates were generally higher than in the prior year  which resulted in lower actual and projected prepayments 
such lower prepayments resulted in lower amortization and impairment 
the combined amounts of amortization and impairment  were  million and  million during and  respectively 
long term treasury and swap rates are the indices that underlie the derivatives that constitute the primary components of the servicing hedge 
there was little change in these rates from december  to december  the servicing hedge loss of million in resulted primarily from time value decay on the options included in the servicing hedge 
during  the servicing hedge generated a gain of million 
this gain resulted from a decline in long term treasury and swap rates during the first part of the servicing hedge gains generated in the early part of were partly offset by servicing hedge losses toward the end of the year as long term treasury and swap rates rose 
in a stable interest rate environment  we would expect to incur no significant impairment charges  however  we would expect to incur losses related to the servicing hedge driven primarily by time decay on options used in the hedge 
the level of such servicing hedge losses depends on various factors such as the size and composition of the hedge  the shape of the yield curve and the level of implied interest rate volatility 
our servicing portfolio grew to billion at december   a increase from december  at the same time  the overall weighted average note rate of loans in our servicing portfolio declined from to 
loan closing services sector this sector is comprised of the landsafe companies  which provide credit reports  flood determinations  appraisals  property valuation services and title reports primarily to the loan production sector but increasingly to third parties as well 
our integration of these previously outsourced services has provided not only incremental profits but also higher overall levels of service and quality control 
the landsafe companies produced million in pre tax earnings  representing a decrease of from the prior year 
the decrease in landsafe s pre tax earnings was primarily due to the decrease in our loan origination activity 
diversified businesses to leverage our mortgage banking franchise  as well as to reduce the variability of earnings due to changes in mortgage interest rates  we have engaged in other financial services 
these other businesses are grouped into the following segments banking  capital markets  insurance and global operations 
banking segment our banking strategy includes holding loans in portfolio that historically would have been immediately securitized and sold into the secondary mortgage market 
management believes this strategy will increase earnings  as well as provide more stable earnings over the long term 
in the short term  reported profits will be impacted by the reduction in gains otherwise recognizable at time of sale 
the banking segment achieved pre tax earnings of million during  as compared to million for the year ago period

the margin increase was the result of a change in the mix of interest earning assets toward mortgage loans and the reduced amortization of loan origination costs and purchase premiums on securities resulting from lower prepayments on mortgage loans and securities

cwl s pre tax earnings decreased by million during in comparison to the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in average mortgage warehouse advances  which in turn resulted from an overall decline in the mortgage originations market 
capital markets segment our capital markets segment achieved pre tax earnings of million for  an increase of million  or  from the year ago period 
total revenues were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ago period 
capital markets benefited by underwriting the production sector s prime home equity and nonprime mortgage loan securitizations  which increased significantly in the current year 
this benefit was offset by a less favorable mortgage related fixed income securities market 
these factors led to reduced mortgage backed securities trading volumes and margins 
this segment has expanded its staffing and infrastructure to invest in the development of new lines of business such as us treasury securities trading  commercial real estate finance and broker dealer operations in japan  which largely contributed to an increase in expenses of million  or  compared to the year ago period

underwriting revenues increased million over the prior year as a result of increased sales of our nonprime and home equity securities 
trading revenues declined due to a decrease in the size of the overall mortgage market  which resulted in a decline in mortgage securities trading volume and margins

our life and casualty insurance business produced pre tax earnings of million  a decrease of million from the prior year 
the decline in earnings was driven by million in estimated losses relating to hurricane damage sustained in florida during in comparison to million of catastrophic losses in the prior year  partially offset by a decline in non catastrophic losses and a million  or  increase in net earned premiums during in comparison to the prior year

the decline in margins from the high levels realized in was due to increased price competition as a result of lower homeowner demand for refinance mortgage loans  combined with a shift in homeowner preference toward adjustable rate mortgages  which generally carry lower margins than year fixed rate mortgages 
gain on sale of prime home equity and nonprime mortgage loans increased in compared to  due primarily to increased sales of these loans  offset somewhat by lower margins on the sale of nonprime mortgage loans 
inventory of these products had been accumulated during recent periods of high origination volume 
reperforming loans are reinstated loans that had previously defaulted and were repurchased from mortgage securities we issued 
the note rate on these loans is typically higher than the current mortgage rate  and therefore  the margin on these loans is typically higher than margins on prime mortgage loans 
a change in ginnie mae rules related to the repurchase of defaulted loans from ginnie mae securities has reduced the amount of loans available for repurchase  which has contributed to a lower gain on sale related to these items 
the increase in capital markets underwriting revenues was due to increased sales of our nonprime and home equity securities combined with an increase in third party underwriting business 
the increase in capital markets gain on sale related to its conduit activities was due to increased margins on sales of distressed assets combined with increased sales of nonprime mortgage loans 
capital markets revenues from its trading activities consist of gain on sale and interest income 
in a steep yield curve environment  which generally existed during and  trading revenues derive largely or entirely from net interest income earned during the securities holding period 
as the yield curve flattens  the mix of revenues will naturally shift toward gain on sale of securities 
in general  gain on sale of loans and securities is affected by numerous factors  including the volume and mix of loans sold  production channel mix  the level of price competition  the slope of the yield curve  and the effectiveness of our associated interest rate risk management activities

also contributing to the increase in net interest income from mortgage banking is a decline in the overall borrowing rate as a result of the use of more cost effective short term financing 
net interest expense from custodial balances decreased in the current period due to the decrease in loan payoffs from the year ago period 
we are required to pass through monthly interest to security holders on paid off loans at the underlying security rates  which were substantially higher than the short term rates earned by us on the payoff float 
the amount of such interest passed through to the security holders was million and million in the and  respectively 
interest expense allocated to the loan servicing sector increased primarily due to an increase in total servicing sector assets 
the decrease in interest income related to reperforming loans is a result of a decrease in the average balance of such loans held 
the increase in net interest income from the banking segment was primarily attributable to growth in the average investment in mortgage loans in the bank

the resulting excess yield has been securitized and sold or is included on the balance sheet as trading securities 
the decrease in income from other retained interests was due primarily to a slight decrease in the yield on these investments during these investments include interest only and principal only securities as well as residual interests that arise from the securitization of nonconforming mortgage loans  particularly nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights we recorded amortization of msrs of  million  or an annual rate of  during as compared to  million  or an annual rate of  during the reduction in the amortization rate reflects the increase in the estimated life of the servicing portfolio  which is attributable to the effect of comparatively higher interest rates during the current period on estimated future prepayments 
partially offsetting the lower amortization rate was a higher msr asset balance attributable to net growth in the servicing portfolio during impairment of retained interests and servicing hedge losses gains impairment of retained interests and servicing hedge losses gains are detailed below years ended december  in thousands impairment of retained interests msrs other retained interests servicing hedge losses gains recorded in earnings impairment of msrs in resulted generally from a decline in their estimated fair value  driven by a slight decrease in mortgage rates during the year 
however  impairment of msrs was lower in than in because mortgage rates were generally higher during the current year than in impairment of msrs during resulted from a reduction in the estimated fair value of msrs  primarily driven by the decline in mortgage rates during much of the period 
in  we recognized impairment of other retained interests  primarily as a result of a decline in the value of nonprime securities 
the collateral underlying certain of these residuals is fixed rate while the pass through rate is floating 
an increase in projected short term interest rates during the current period resulted in a compression of the spread on such residuals  which resulted in a decline in their value 
rising mortgage rates in the future should result in an increase in the estimated fair value of the msrs and recovery of all or a portion of the impairment reserve 
the msr amortization rate  which is tied to the expected net cash flows from the msrs  likewise should reduce as mortgage rates rise 
there was little change in long term treasury and swap rates from december  to december  the servicing hedge loss of million in resulted primarily from time value decay on the options included in the servicing hedge 
during  the servicing hedge generated a gain of million 
this gain resulted from a decline in long term treasury and swap rates during the first part of the servicing hedge gains generated in the early part of were partly offset by servicing hedge losses toward the end of the year as long term treasury and swap rates rose 
the servicing hedge is intended to moderate the effect on earnings caused by changes in the estimated fair value of msrs and other retained interests that generally result from changes in mortgage rates 
rising interest rates in the future will result in servicing hedge losses 
net insurance premiums earned the increase in net insurance premiums earned is due to an increase in premiums earned on lender placed and voluntary lines of businesses combined with an increase in reinsurance premiums

results of operations for the year ended december   and year ended december  consolidated earnings performance our diluted earnings per share for totaled  a increase over diluted earnings per share for net earnings were  million  a increase from this earnings performance was driven by an increase in our mortgage loan production from billion in to billion in in addition  diversified businesses achieved a substantial overall increase in earnings in industry wide  mortgage loan production reached a record level of trillion in  up from trillion during source of mortgage market mortgage bankers association 
approximately two thirds of the mortgages produced in were refinances of existing mortgages that were triggered by historically low mortgage rates 
these same low rates contributed to increased activity in the us housing market  which also reached record levels in the continued high demand for mortgages also drove high production margins in the combination of high volumes and margins yielded loan production sector pre tax earnings of  million for  an increase of  million from the high levels of mortgage refinances and home purchases resulted in significant prepayments within our mortgage loan servicing portfolio during the period 
this  along with the expectation of continued higher than normal prepayments in the future due to low mortgage rates  resulted in significant amortization and impairment of msrs and other retained interests in the combined amount of amortization and impairment of msrs and other retained interests  net of servicing hedge gains  was  million  resulting in a pre tax loss of  million in the loan servicing sector for  compared to a pre tax loss of  million in these factors combined to produce pre tax earnings of  million in the mortgage banking segment for  an increase of  million  or  from our diversified businesses had combined pre tax earnings of million in  an increase of over benefiting again from a favorable market environment  our capital markets segment achieved pre tax earnings of million  up from million in in addition  our banking segment increased its pre tax earnings by million over the prior year  driven primarily by growth in its portfolio of mortgage loans

our mortgage origination market share was in  up from in source of mortgage market mortgage bankers association 
ongoing favorable market conditions contributed to the continued high revenues earned  while high productivity levels helped keep unit costs low 
these factors combined to produce continued high profit margins pre tax earnings as a percentage of loan volume for the loan production sector 
mortgage banking loan production for increased in comparison to the increase was due primarily to a rise in non purchase loan production of 
an increase in purchase production of also contributed to the higher origination volume 
the following table summarizes mortgage banking loan production by purpose and interest rate type years ended december  in millions purpose purchase non purchase interest rate type fixed rate adjustable rate in  of our loan production was fixed rate  which reflects homeowner preferences for fixed rate mortgages in a low mortgage rate environment 
management expects that a higher percentage of homeowners would potentially choose adjustable rate mortgages in a higher interest rate environment 
such a shift in homeowner preferences may favor portfolio lenders  which by the nature of their business model are better able to fund adjustable rate mortgages  over mortgage bankers that rely more heavily on securitization 
as shown in the following table  the volume of mortgage banking prime home equity and nonprime loans produced which is included in the total volume of loans produced increased during the current period from the prior period years ended december  dollar amounts in millions prime home equity loans nonprime mortgage loans percent of total mortgage banking loan production prime home equity and nonprime mortgage loans carry higher profit margins historically  and the demand for such loans is believed to be less rate sensitive than the demand for prime home loans 
consequently  we believe these loans will be a significant component of the sector s future profitability  in particular if mortgage rates should rise significantly 
during  the loan production sector operated at approximately of planned operational capacity 
the primary capacity constraint in our loan origination activities is the number of loan operations personnel we have on staff 
therefore  we measure planned capacity with reference to the number of loan operations personnel we have multiplied by the number of loans we expect each available loan operations staff person to process under normal conditions 
as volume decreased toward the end of  we began to make reductions in operations staff

the amortization and impairment charges reflect the loss in value of the company s retained interests  which was primarily due to the high level of actual and projected prepayments in the company s mortgage servicing portfolio 
in general  the value of the retained interests is closely linked to the estimated life of the underlying loans 
as prepayments increase  the estimated life of the underlying loans decreases 
the combined impairment and amortization charge was  million and  million during and  respectively

margins on prime mortgage loans were high in both periods on a relative historical basis  due largely to the very favorable mortgage market environment that prevailed during those periods 
during  we sold a small portion of prime home equity loans produced 
subsequently  the remaining loans were securitized and sold during with the gain on sale of these loans being reflected in that period 
reperforming loans are reinstated loans that had previously defaulted  and were consequently re purchased from mortgage securities we issued 
the increase in gain on sale of reperforming loans was due to an increase in the volume of loans sold 
the note rate on these loans is typically higher than the current mortgage rate  and therefore  the margin on these loans is typically higher than margins on prime mortgage loans 
the increase in capital markets gain on sale of loans related to its conduit activities was due to increased acquisitions and sales during in comparison to the increase in underwriting revenues was due to increased third party underwriting during capital markets revenues from its trading activities consist of gains on the sale of securities and net interest income 
in a very steep yield curve environment  which existed during both periods  trading revenues will derive largely or entirely from net interest income earned during the securities holding period 
as the yield curve flattens  the mix of revenues will shift toward gain on sale of securities 
in general  gain on sale of loans and securities is affected by numerous factors  including the volume and mix of loans sold  production channel mix  the level of price competition  the slope of the yield curve and the effectiveness of our associated interest rate risk management activities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk we face is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk includes the risk that the value of our assets and liabilities will change due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk also includes the risk that the net interest income from our mortgage loan and investment portfolios will change in response to changes in interest rates 
from an enterprise perspective  we manage interest rate risk through the natural counterbalance of our loan production and servicing businesses 
we also use various financial instruments  including derivatives  to manage the interest rate risk related specifically to the values of our interest rate lock commitments  mortgage loan inventory and mbs held for sale  msrs and other retained interests  and trading securities  as well as a portion of our debt 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management activities is to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in interest rates 
our corporate asset liability management committee  which is comprised of several of the company s senior financial executives  maintains responsibility for management of this risk 
interest rate lock commitments and mortgage inventory we are exposed to interest rate risk from the time an interest rate lock commitment irlc is made to a mortgage applicant or financial intermediary to the time the resulting mortgage loan is sold 
during this period  we are exposed to losses if mortgage rates rise  because the value of the irlc or mortgage declines 
to manage this risk  we use derivatives  primarily forward sales of mbs and options to buy and sell mbs  as well as options on treasury futures contracts 
irlcs guarantee the rate and points on the underlying mortgage for a specified period  generally from seven to days 
managing the interest rate risk related to irlcs is complicated by the fact that the ultimate percentage of applications that close within the terms of the irlc is variable 
the primary factor that drives the variability of the closing percentage is marketplace changes in mortgage rates 
in general  the percentage of applications that ultimately close within the terms of the irlc increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall 
this is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicants committed rates 
the closing percentage is also influenced by the source of the applications  age of the applications  purpose for the loans purchase or refinance and the application approval rate 
we have developed closing ratio estimates using empirical data taking into account all of these variables 
our closing ratio estimates also take into account renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall 
our closing ratio estimates are revised periodically using the most current empirical data 
to manage the interest rate risk associated with irlcs  we use a combination of net forward sales of mbs and put and call options on mbs or treasury futures 
as a general rule  we enter into forward sales of mbs in an amount equal to the portion of the irlcs expected to close  assuming no change in mortgage rates 
we acquire put and call options to protect against the variability of loan closings caused by changes in mortgage rates  using our current closing ratio estimates to determine the amount of optional coverage required 
we manage the interest rate risk related to our mortgage loan inventory primarily by entering into forward sales of mbs 
the value of these forward sales moves in the opposite direction of the value of the mortgage loan inventory 
we actively manage our irlcs and mortgage inventory risk profiles on a daily basis 
we use the following derivative instruments in our risk management activities related to the irlcs and mortgage loan inventory forward sales of mbs represents an obligation to sell an mbs at a specified price in the future 
its value increases as mortgage rates rise 
forward purchases of mbs represents an obligation to buy an mbs at a specified price in the future 
its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
long call options on mbs represents a right to buy an mbs at a specified price in the future 
its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
long put options on mbs represents a right to sell an mbs at a specified price in the future 
its value increases as mortgage rates rise 
long call options on treasury futures represents a right to acquire a treasury futures contract at a specified price in the future 
its value increases as the benchmark treasury rate falls 
long put options on treasury futures represents a right to sell a treasury futures contract at a specified price in the future 
its value increases as the benchmark treasury rate rises 
short eurodollar futures contracts represents a standardized exchange traded contract  the value of which is tied to spot eurodollar rates at specified future dates 
its value increases when eurodollar rates rise 
mortgage servicing rights msrs and other retained interests our msrs and other retained interests are generally subject to loss in value when mortgage rates decline 
declining mortgage rates generally precipitate increased mortgage refinancing activity 
increased refinancing activity reduces the life of the loans underlying the msrs and other retained interests  thereby reducing their value 
reductions in the value of these assets impact earnings through impairment charges 
to moderate the effect on earnings of impairment  we maintain a portfolio of financial instruments  including derivatives  which generally increase in aggregate value when interest rates decline the servicing hedge 
we currently use  or have used in the past  the following financial instruments in our servicing hedge interest rate floors represents a right to receive cash if a reference interest rate falls below a contractual strike rate 
its value increases as reference interest rates fall 
the reference interest rates used include mortgage rates  treasury rates and us dollar usd libor 
us treasury securities consists of notes and bonds with maturities ranging generally from to years 
as interest rates decrease  the value of these securities generally increases 
long treasury futures represent an agreement to purchase a treasury security at a specified price in the future 
its value increases as the benchmark treasury rate falls 
long call options on treasury and eurodollar futures represents a right to acquire a treasury or eurodollar futures contract at a specified price in the future 
its value increases as the benchmark treasury or eurodollar deposit rate falls 
long put options on treasury and eurodollar futures represents a right to sell a treasury or eurodollar futures contract at a specified price in the future 
its value increases as the benchmark treasury or eurodollar deposit rate rises 
long call options on mbs represents a right to buy an mbs at a specified price in the future 
its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
forward purchases of mbs represents an obligation to buy an mbs at a specified price in the future 
its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
interest rate swaps represents a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party paying a fixed rate and another paying a floating rate tied to a reference interest rate eg  usd libor 
for use in the servicing hedge  we generally receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate 
such contracts increase in value as rates fall 
receiver swaptions represents a right to enter into a predetermined interest rate swap at a future date upon exercise of the right we receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate 
these contracts increase in value as rates fall 
payor swaptions represents a right to enter into a predetermined interest rate swap at a future date  whereupon exercise of the right we pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate 
these contracts increase in value as rates rise 
principal only securities consist of mortgage trust principal only securities and treasury principal only securities 
these securities have been purchased at discounts to par value 
as interest rates decrease  the value of these securities generally increase 
these instruments are combined to manage the overall risk profile of the msrs and other retained interests 
we actively manage our retained interests risk profile on a daily basis 
securities trading activities within our capital markets operations  we maintain a trading portfolio of fixed income securities  primarily mbs 
we are exposed to price changes in our trading portfolio arising from interest rate changes during the period we hold the securities 
to manage this risk  we use the following derivative instruments forward sales of to be announced tba mbs represents an obligation to sell agency pass through mbs that have not yet been issued at a specified price and at a specified date in the future 
its value increases as mortgage rates rise 
forward purchases of tba mbs represents an obligation to purchase agency pass through mbs that have not yet been issued at a specified price at a specified date in the future 
its value increases as mortgage rates fall

the value of these contracts increases when fed funds or eurodollar rates fall 
treasury bank the primary component of treasury bank s earnings is net interest income derived from our mortgage loan and investment portfolios 
at treasury bank  we invest primarily in adjustable rate and short duration residential mortgages 
our securities portfolio is comprised mostly of short duration sequential collateralized mortgage obligations 
we manage our interest rate risk primarily by investing in relatively simple  short duration assets  and matching the duration and re pricing characteristics of our liabilities with those of our assets 
deposits are priced to encourage consumers to choose maturity terms consistent with our assets 
interest rate swaps are also used to efficiently and cost effectively convert long term fixed rate deposits to adjustable rate deposits 
in addition  the structure and terms of our borrowings are chosen to manage our interest rate risk 
debt securities we determine the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt as part of our overall interest rate risk management activities 
we use interest rate swaps to efficiently and cost effectively achieve our desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
typically  terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the underlying debt  resulting in an effective conversion of the debt rate 
impact of changes in interest rates on the net value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments we perform various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses incorporate assumed changes in the interest rate environment  including selected hypothetical  instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
we employ various commonly used modeling techniques to value our financial instruments in connection with these sensitivity analyses 
for mortgage loans  mbs  mbs forward contracts  collateralized mortgage obligations and msrs  option adjusted spread oas models are used 
the primary assumptions used in these models for purpose of these sensitivity analyses are the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds 
for options and interest rate floors  an option pricing model is used 
the primary assumption used in this model is implied market volatility of interest rates 
other retained interests are valued using zero volatility discounted cash flow models 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment rates  discount rates and credit losses 
all relevant cash flows associated with the financial instruments are incorporated in the various models 
based upon this modeling  the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value of our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments as of december   given several hypothetical  instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield curve change in fair value change in interest rate basis points in millions msrs and other financial instruments msr and other retained interests impact of servicing hedge swap based treasury based msrs and other retained interests  net committed pipeline mortgage loan inventory impact of associated derivative instruments mortgage based treasury based eurodollar based committed pipeline and mortgage loan inventory  net treasury bank securities portfolio mortgage loans deposit liabilities federal home loan bank advances treasury bank  net notes payable and capital securities impact of associated derivative instruments swap based notes payable and capital securities  net insurance company investment portfolios net change in fair value related to msrs and other financial instruments net change in fair value related to broker dealer trading securities the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments as of december   given several hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve change in fair value change in interest rate basis points in millions net change in fair value related to msrs and other financial instruments net change in fair value related to broker dealer trading securities these sensitivity analyses are limited in that they were performed at a particular point in time  only contemplate certain movements in interest rates  do not incorporate changes in interest rate volatility or changes in the relationship of one interest rate index to another  are subject to the accuracy of various assumptions used  including prepayment forecasts and discount rates  and do not incorporate other factors that would impact the company s overall financial performance in such scenarios  most significantly the impact of changes in loan production earnings that result from changes in interest rates 
in addition  not all of the changes in fair value would impact current period earnings 
for example  msrs are carried by impairment stratum at the lower of amortized cost or market value 
consequently  absent hedge accounting  any increase in the value of a particular msr stratum above its amortized cost basis would not be reflected in current period earnings 
in addition  our debt is carried at its unpaid principal balance net of issuance discount or premium  therefore  absent hedge accounting  changes in the market value of our debt are not recorded in current period earnings 
for these reasons  the preceding estimates should not be viewed as an earnings forecast 
market risk foreign currency risk in order to diversify our funding sources globally  we occasionally issue medium term notes denominated in a foreign currency 
we manage the foreign currency risk associated with these medium term notes through cross currency swap transactions 
the terms of the cross currency swaps effectively convert all foreign currency denominated medium term notes into us dollar obligations  thereby eliminating the associated foreign currency risk 
as a result  potential changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies denominating such medium term notes would not have a net financial impact on future earnings  fair values or cash flows 
credit risk management credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or an institution to honor its contractual obligations to us 
credit risk arises in many of our business activities including lending activities  securities trading activities and interest rate risk management activities 
we actively manage credit risk to maintain credit losses within levels that achieve our profitability and return on capital objectives while meeting our expectations for consistent financial performance 
our credit committee  which is comprised of our chief credit officer and other senior executives  has primary responsibility for setting strategies to achieve our credit risk goals and objectives 
those goals and objectives are documented in our credit policy 
mortgage credit risk overview in our mortgage lending activities  we manage our credit risk through credit policy  underwriting  quality control and surveillance activities as well as through use of credit enhancements  especially nonrecourse and limited recourse securitizations 
we also employ proactive collection and loss mitigation efforts 
loan quality our credit policy establishes standards for the determination of acceptable credit risks 
those standards encompass borrower and collateral quality  underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards and procedures 
borrower quality includes consideration of the borrower s credit and capacity to pay 
we assess credit and capacity to pay through the use of credit scores  application of a mortgage scorecard  and manual or automated underwriting of additional credit characteristics 
collateral quality includes consideration of property value  condition and marketability and is determined through physical inspections and the use of manual and automated valuation models 
underwriting guidelines facilitate the uniform application of underwriting standards to all borrowers regardless of race  religion or ethnic background 
uniformity in underwriting also provides a means for measuring and managing credit risk 
this allows us  as well as government sponsored entities gses  private investors  and the secondary markets in general  to assess risk  which provides us with more flexibility in the sale of loans 
our conventional conforming underwriting guidelines comply with the guidelines established by fannie mae or freddie mac 
our underwriting guidelines for fha insured and va guaranteed mortgage loans comply with guidelines established by the us department of housing and urban development or the veterans administration 
our underwriting guidelines for non conforming mortgage loans  prime home equity loans  and nonprime mortgage loans have been designed so that these loans are salable in the secondary mortgage market 
we developed these guidelines to meet the requirements of private investors  rating agencies and third party credit enhancement providers 
our loan origination standards and procedures are designed to produce high quality loans 
these standards and procedures encompass underwriter qualifications and authority levels  appraisal review requirements  fraud prevention  funds disbursement controls  training of our employees and ongoing review of their work 
we help to ensure that our origination standards are met by employing accomplished and seasoned management  underwriters and processors and through the extensive use of technology 
we also have a comprehensive training program for the continuing development of both our existing staff and new hires 
in addition  we employ proprietary underwriting systems in our loan origination process that improve the consistency of underwriting standards  assess collateral adequacy and help to prevent fraud  while at the same time increasing productivity 
in addition to our pre funding controls and procedures  we employ an extensive post funding quality control process 
our quality control department  under the direction of the chief credit officer  is responsible for completing comprehensive loan audits that consist of a re verification of loan documentation  an in depth underwriting and appraisal review  and if necessary  a fraud investigation 
we also employ a pre and post funding proprietary loan performance evaluation system 
this system identifies fraud and poor performance of individuals and business entities associated with the origination of our loans 
the combination of this system and our audit results allows us to evaluate and measure adherence to prescribed underwriting guidelines and compliance with laws and regulations 
sale of loans nearly all of the mortgage loans that we originate are sold into the secondary mortgage market primarily in the form of securities  and to a lesser extent as whole loans 
while we generally sell our prime mortgage loans on a non recourse basis  either in the form of securities or whole loans  we do have potential liability under the representations and warranties we make to purchasers and insurers of the loans 
in the event of a breach of such representations and warranties  we may be required to either repurchase the subject mortgage loans or indemnify the investor or insurer 
in such cases  we bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans 
securitization as described below  the degree to which credit risk on the underlying loans is transferred through the securitization process depends on the structure of the securitization 
our prime mortgage loans generally are securitized on a non recourse basis  while prime home equity and nonprime mortgage loans generally are securitized with limited recourse for credit losses 
conforming conventional loans conforming conventional loans are generally pooled into mortgage backed securities guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac 
a small portion of these loans also has been sold to the federal home loan bank  through its mortgage partnership finance program 
subject to certain representations and warranties we make  nearly all conventional loans securitized through fannie mae or freddie mac are sold on a non recourse basis 
we pay guarantee fees to these agencies to compensate them for their assumption of credit risk on the securitized loans 
fha insured and va guaranteed loans fha insured and va guaranteed mortgage loans are generally pooled into mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae 
a small portion of these loans has been sold to the federal home loan bank  through its mortgage partnership finance program 
we are insured against foreclosure loss by the fha or partially guaranteed against foreclosure loss by the va 
fees charged by the fha and va for assuming such risks are paid directly by the mortgagors 
we are exposed to credit losses on defaulted va loans to the extent that the partial guarantee provided by the va is inadequate to cover the total credit losses incurred 
we pay guarantee fees to ginnie mae for ginnie mae s guarantee on its securities of timely payment of principal and interest 
ginnie mae does not assume mortgage credit risk associated with the loans securitized under its program 
non conforming conventional prime loans non conforming conventional prime mortgage loans are generally pooled into private label non agency mortgage backed securities 
such securitizations involve some form of credit enhancement  such as senior subordinated structures  overcollateralization or mortgage pool insurance 
securitizations that involve senior subordinated structures contain securities that assume varying levels of credit risk 
holders of subordinated securities are compensated for the credit risk assumed through a higher yield 
we generally sell the subordinated securities created in connection with these securitizations and thereby transfer the related credit risk subject to representations and warranties we make when the loans are securitized 
prime home equity loans prime home equity loans are generally pooled into private label asset backed securities 
these securities generally are credit enhanced through over collateralization and guarantees provided by a third party surety 
in such securitizations  countrywide is subject to limited recourse for credit losses through retention of a residual interest 
nonprime mortgage loans nonprime mortgage loans generally are pooled into private label asset backed securities 
we generally securitize these loans with limited recourse for credit losses through retention of a residual interest  which usually ranges from to of the principal balance of the loans 
in some cases  such limited recourse securitizations have contained mortgage pool insurance as the primary form of credit enhancement  coupled with a limited corporate guarantee from us and or a retained residual interest 
when mortgage pool insurance is used  we pay the associated premiums 
we also have pooled a portion of our nonprime mortgage loans into securities guaranteed by fannie mae 
in such cases  we have paid fannie mae a guarantee fee in exchange for fannie mae assuming the credit risk of the underlying loans 
our exposure to credit losses related to our limited recourse securitization activities is limited to the carrying value of our subordinated interests and to the contractual limit of reimbursable losses under our corporate guarantees less the recorded liability for such guarantees 
these amounts at december  are as follows december  in thousands subordinated interests prime home equity residual securities nonprime residual securities prime home equity transferor s interests nonconforming residual securities subordinated mortgage backed pass through securities corporate guarantees in excess of recorded liability the carrying value of the residual securities is net of expected future credit losses 
the total credit losses incurred for and related to all of our mortgage securitization activities are summarized as follows years ended december  in thousands nonprime securitizations with retained residual interest repurchased or indemnified loans prime home equity securitizations with retained residual interest nonprime securitizations with corporate guarantee prime home equity securitizations with corporate guarantee va losses in excess of va guarantee mortgage reinsurance we provide mortgage reinsurance on mortgage loans included in our servicing portfolio through contracts with several primary mortgage insurance companies 
under these contracts  we absorb mortgage insurance losses in excess of a specified percentage of the principal balance of a given pool of loans  subject to a cap  in exchange for a portion of the pools mortgage insurance premium 
as of december   approximately billion of mortgage loans in our servicing portfolio are covered by such mortgage reinsurance contracts 
the reinsurance contracts place limits on our maximum exposure to losses 
at december   the maximum aggregate losses under the reinsurance contracts were million 
we are required to pledge securities to cover this potential liability 
we recorded provisions for losses related to this activity of million in mortgage loans held for sale at december   mortgage loans held for sale amounted to billion 
while the loans are in inventory  we bear credit risk after taking into consideration primary mortgage insurance which is generally required for conventional loans with a loan to value ratio greater than  fha insurance or va guarantees 
historically  credit losses related to loans held for sale have not been significant 
portfolio lending activities we have a portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment  consisting primarily of prime mortgage and prime home equity loans  which amounted to billion at december  this portfolio is held primarily in our bank 
prime home equity loans held in the bank with combined loan to value ratios equal to or above are covered by a pool insurance policy that provides partial protection against credit losses 
otherwise  we generally retain full credit exposure on these loans 
we also provide short term secured mortgage loan warehouse advances to various lending institutions  which totaled billion at december  our total allowance for credit losses for mortgage loans held for investment amounted to million at december  related net charge offs during totaled million 
counterparty credit risk we have exposure to credit loss in the event of contractual non performance by our trading counterparties and counterparties to our various over the counter derivative financial instruments 
we manage this credit risk by selecting only well established  financially strong counterparties  spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties  and by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty 
the aggregate amount of counterparty credit exposure at december   before and after collateral held by us  was as follows december  in millions aggregate credit exposure before collateral held less collateral held net aggregate unsecured credit exposure for the year ended december   we incurred no credit losses due to non performance of any of our counterparties 
loan servicing the following table sets forth certain information regarding our servicing portfolio of single family mortgage loans  including loans and securities held for sale  loans held for investment and loans serviced under subservicing agreements  for the periods indicated 
years ended december  in millions beginning owned portfolio add loan production purchased msrs less runoff ending owned portfolio subservicing portfolio total servicing portfolio msr portfolio mortgage loans owned subservicing portfolio total servicing portfolio dollar amounts in millions composition of owned portfolio at period end conventional mortgage fha insured mortgage va guaranteed mortgage nonprime mortgage prime home equity total owned portfolio delinquent mortgage loans days days days or more total delinquent mortgage loans loans pending foreclosure delinquent mortgage loans conventional government nonprime mortgage prime home equity total delinquent mortgage loans loans pending foreclosure conventional government nonprime mortgage prime home equity total loans pending foreclosure runoff refers to scheduled principal repayments on loans and unscheduled prepayments partial prepayments or total prepayments due to refinancing  modification  sale  condemnation or foreclosure 
expressed as a percentage of the total number of loans serviced  excluding subserviced loans and loans purchased at a discount due to their non performing status 
we attribute the overall decline in delinquencies in our servicing portfolio primarily to the relative overall increase in the number of loans in the conventional and prime home equity portfolios  which carry lower delinquency rates than the government and nonprime portfolios 
also contributing to the decline in the overall delinquency rate is a reduction in the delinquency rate of our nonprime portfolio 
we believe the delinquency rates in our servicing portfolio are consistent with industry experience for similar mortgage loan portfolios 
inflation our operations that would be most significantly impacted by an increase in inflation are our mortgage banking and capital markets operations 
interest rates normally increase during periods of rising inflation 
historically  as interest rates increase  mortgage loan production decreases  particularly from loan refinancing 
an environment of gradual interest rate increases may  however  signify an improving economy or increasing real estate values  which in turn may stimulate increased home buying activity 
generally  in such periods of reduced mortgage loan production the associated profit margins also decline due to increased competition among mortgage loan originators and to higher unit costs  thus further reducing our loan production earnings 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  our loan servicing earnings generally increase because mortgage prepayment rates tend to slow down  thereby extending the average life of our servicing portfolio and thus reducing the amortization and impairment of our msrs 
within our broker dealer operations  rising interest rates generally lead to a reduction in trading and underwriting activities in its primary niche  the mortgage securities market 
seasonality the mortgage banking industry is generally subject to seasonal trends 
these seasonal trends reflect the pattern in the national housing market 
home sales typically rise during the spring and summer seasons and decline during the fall and winter seasons 
seasonality has less of an effect on mortgage refinancing activity  which is primarily driven by prevailing mortgage rates 
in addition  mortgage delinquency rates typically rise temporarily in the winter months  driven by mortgagor payment patterns 
liquidity and capital resources we have significant short term and long term financing needs 
our short term financing needs arise primarily from the warehousing of mortgage loans pending sale and the trading activities of our broker dealer 
our long term financing needs arise primarily from our investments in msrs and other retained interests  along with the financial instruments acquired to manage the interest rate risk associated with those investments  as well as from the continued growth of our mortgage loan investment portfolio 
as discussed in the following paragraphs  we meet our financing needs in a variety of ways  through the public corporate debt and equity markets  as well as the mortgage and asset backed securities markets  and increasingly in the future through the deposit gathering and other financing activities of our bank 
liquidity management the objective of our liquidity management is to ensure that adequate reliable sources of cash are available to meet our potential near term funding needs  including periods of stress within the financial markets 
we manage our liquidity by financing our assets in a manner consistent with their liquidity profile 
assets that are considered illiquid are financed with long term capital equity and debt with a final maturity greater than six months 
we manage our long term debt maturities which we define for this purpose as debt maturing after six months  and credit facility expirations to minimize refinancing risk 
we also manage the timing of our short term debt maturities to limit the amount maturing in any five day period 
we diversify our financing programs  credit providers and debt investors and dealers to reduce reliance upon any one source of liquidity 
finally  we assess all sources of financing based upon their reliability  recognizing that certain financing programs are sensitive to temporary market disruptions 
we regularly forecast our potential funding needs over three month and longer horizons  taking into account debt maturities and potential peak balance sheet levels 
available reliable sources of liquidity are appropriately established and sized to meet potential future funding requirements 
we currently have billion in reliable sources of short term liquidity  including secured and unsecured committed bank lines of credit and reusable mortgage purchase commitments totaling billion 
our long term debt typically consists of unsecured debt issued in the public corporate debt markets 
at december   we had billion in unsecured long term debt outstanding 
see note notes payable in the financial statement section of this report for additional descriptions of our committed financing programs 
public corporate debt markets the public corporate debt markets are a key source of financing for us  due to their efficiency and low cost 
typically  we access these markets by issuing unsecured commercial paper and medium term notes 
we also have issued unsecured subordinated debt  convertible debt and trust preferred securities 
at december   we had a total of billion in public corporate debt outstanding 
to maintain our desired level of access to the public corporate debt markets  it is critical for us to maintain investment grade credit ratings 
we have consistently maintained solid investment grade credit ratings over the past years 
given our current ratings  we generally have deep access to the public corporate debt markets 
current credit ratings are as follows countrywide home loans countrywide short term financial corporation ratings long term ratings standard and poors a a moody s investors service p a fitch f a the company expects to receive short term credit ratings for cfc consistent with those currently in place at countrywide home loans in the near future 
among other things  maintenance of our current investment grade ratings requires that we have high levels of liquidity  including access to alternative sources of funding such as committed bank stand by lines of credit  as well as a conservative capital structure 
our policy is to maintain our regulatory capital ratios at levels that are above the well capitalized standards defined by the federal reserve board 
at december  and at december   cfc s regulatory capital ratios were as follows december  december  minimum required ratio amount ratio amount dollar amounts in thousands tier leverage capital risk based capital tier total minimum required to qualify as well capitalized 
our primary source of equity capital is retained earnings 
we also have billion outstanding in junior subordinated debentures that receive varying degrees of equity treatment from rating agencies  bank lenders and regulators 
in addition  we currently have a billion deferred tax liability related to our msrs that would offset a portion of any potential loss in the value of our msrs and which  to that extent  can be viewed as a supplement to our equity capital 
from time to time  we engage in stock offerings as a means of increasing our capital base and supporting our growth 
issues of concern to one or more credit rating agencies in the past have included our significant investment in msrs and other retained interests  our involvement in nonprime lending  as well as our liquidity and capital structure 
we maintain an active dialogue with all three rating agencies  meeting throughout the year to review operational and financial performance and to address specific areas of focus 
in the unlikely event our credit ratings were to drop below investment grade  our access to the public corporate debt markets would be severely limited 
the cutoff for investment grade is generally considered to be a long term rating of bbb  or three gradations below our lowest current rating 
in the event of a ratings downgrade below investment grade  we would be required to rely upon alternative sources of financing  such as bank lines and private debt placements secured and unsecured 
furthermore  we would likely be unable to retain all of our existing bank credit commitments beyond the then existing maturity dates 
as a consequence  our cost of financing would rise significantly and we could have to curtail some of our capital intensive activities  such as our ongoing investment in msrs and other retained interests 
on the other hand  given the highly liquid nature of our mortgage inventory and broker dealer trading portfolio  we would likely be able to arrange secured financing for such assets 
over the long term  however  it would be difficult for us to compete effectively without investment grade ratings 
management believes the likelihood of a reduction in our credit ratings to below investment grade in the foreseeable future is remote 
we analyze contingent liquidity scenarios of varying duration and severity for our mortgage company  bank and broker dealer to ensure that sufficient highly reliable sources of committed liquidity are in place and available to finance the company during a temporary market disruption 
asset backed financing market a growing source of funding for us is the asset backed financing market 
this form of financing generally involves the temporary transfer of legal ownership of assets to a separate legal entity conduit in exchange for short term financing 
such financing programs generally have commercial bank sponsors that provide some form of credit enhancement to the program  for example  back up lines of credit or market value swaps 
investors that purchase secured debt  typically commercial paper  issued by these conduits look primarily to the asset value to ensure repayment  rather than to the credit standing of the company that utilizes the conduit for financing 
we have used this market primarily to finance a significant portion of our mortgage loan inventory 
due to its liquid nature and short holding period  our mortgage loan inventory has been well received by asset backed commercial paper investors 
we utilize such programs as a cost effective means to expand and diversify our sources of liquidity 
at december   we had a borrowed a total of billion through such asset backed financing programs 
secondary mortgage market we rely substantially on the secondary mortgage market as a source of long term capital to support our mortgage banking operations 
nearly all mortgage loans that we produce are sold in the secondary mortgage market  primarily in the form of mortgage backed securities mbs and asset backed securities abs 
significant portions of the mbs we sell are guaranteed by fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae collectively  agency mbs 
we also issue non agency or private label mbs and abs 
private label mbs and abs are registered with the sec and have separate credit ratings 
generally  private label mbs and abs require some form of credit enhancement  such as over collateralization  senior subordinated structures  primary mortgage insurance  countrywide guarantees and or private surety guarantees 
the agency mbs market is extremely liquid 
the private label mbs and abs market  particularly the nonprime abs market  is significantly less liquid  although we have enjoyed essentially uninterrupted access to these markets  albeit at varying costs 
we ensure our ongoing access to the secondary mortgage market by consistently producing quality mortgages and servicing those mortgages at levels that meet or exceed secondary mortgage market standards 
as described elsewhere in this document  we have a major focus on ensuring the quality of our mortgage loan production and we make significant investments in personnel and technology in this regard 
repurchase agreements we also utilize short term repurchase agreements as a primary means of financing securities and mortgage loans pending sale 
although this method of financing is uncommitted and short term in nature  it has proven to be a reliable and cost effective financing alternative for us 
funding bank growth our goal is to increase the total assets of our bank from billion as of december  to billion in five years 
we intend to accomplish this goal primarily by using our loan origination operations to source loans for the bank to originate and place in its portfolio 
funding for this growth will come from a variety of sources  including transfers of custodial accounts controlled by chl  secured advances from the federal home loan bank and retail deposits  primarily cds  generated by the bank 
cash flow cash flow provided by operating activities was billion for  compared to net cash used in operating activities of billion for the increase in cash flow from operations for compared to was primarily due to a billion net decrease in cash used to fund mortgage loan inventory 
net cash used by investing activities was billion for  compared to billion for the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a billion decrease in cash used to fund loans held for investment  combined with a billion decrease in cash used to fund investments in other financial instruments 
net cash provided by financing activities for totaled billion  compared to billion for the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was comprised of a billion net decrease in short term primarily secured borrowings  offset by a billion increase in deposit liabilities and a billion net increase in long term debt 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees in the ordinary course of our business we engage in financial transactions that are not recorded on our balance sheet 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in the financial statement section of this report for a description of our consolidation policy 
such transactions are structured to manage our interest rate  credit or liquidity risks  to diversify funding sources or to optimize our capital 
substantially all of our off balance sheet arrangements relate to the securitization of mortgage loans 
our mortgage loan securitizations are normally structured as sales  in accordance with sfas  which involves the transfer of the mortgage loans to qualifying special purpose entities that are not subject to consolidation 
in a securitization  an entity transferring the assets is able to convert those assets into cash 
special purpose entities used in such securitizations obtain cash to acquire the assets by issuing securities to investors 
in a securitization  we customarily provide representations and warranties with respect to the mortgage loans transferred 
in addition  we generally retain the right to service the transferred mortgage loans 
we also generally have the right to repurchase mortgage loans from the special purpose entity if the remaining outstanding balance of the mortgage loans falls to a level where the cost of servicing the loans becomes burdensome in relation to the benefits of servicing 
our prime mortgage loans generally are securitized on a non recourse basis  while prime home equity and nonprime loans generally are securitized with limited recourse for credit losses 
during  we securitized billion in nonprime mortgage and prime home equity loans with limited recourse for credit losses 
our exposure to credit losses related to our limited recourse securitization activities is limited to the carrying value of our subordinated interests and to the contractual limit of reimbursable losses under our corporate guarantees less the recorded liability for such guarantees 
for a further discussion of our exposure to credit risk  see the section in this report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk 
we do not believe that any of our off balance sheet arrangements have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
the sales proceeds and cash flows from our securitizations for and additional information with respect to securitization activities are included in the financial statements section of this report note securitizations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   with the exception of short term borrowing arrangements and pension and post retirement benefit plans 
less than more than note year years years years total in thousands obligations notes payable time deposits operating leases purchase obligations see respective notes to the financial statements included in this report 
as of december   the company had undisbursed home equity lines of credit and construction loan commitments of billion and million  respectively 
as of december   outstanding commitments to fund mortgage loans in process totaled billion 
in connection with the company s underwriting activities  the company had commitments to purchase and sell new issues of securities aggregating million at december  prospective trends united states mortgage market over the last decade  total mortgage indebtedness in the united states has grown at an average annual rate of 
we believe that continued population growth  ongoing developments in the mortgage market and the prospect of relatively low interest rates support similar growth in the market for the foreseeable future 
some of the ongoing developments in the mortgage market that should fuel its growth include government sponsored programs targeted to increase homeownership in low income and minority communities  the growth of prime home equity lending as a major form of consumer finance  and the increasing efficiency of the secondary mortgage market that lowers the overall cost of homeownership 
in recent years  the level of complexity in the mortgage lending business has increased significantly due to several factors the continuing evolution of the secondary mortgage market has resulted in a proliferation of mortgage products  greater regulation imposed on the industry has resulted in increased costs and the need for higher levels of specialization  and interest rate volatility has risen over the last decade 
at the same time  homeowners propensity to refinance their mortgages has increased as the refinance process has become more efficient and cost effective 
the combined result has been large swings in the volume of mortgage loans originated from year to year 
these volume swings have placed significant operational and financial pressures on mortgage lenders 
to compete effectively in this environment  mortgage lenders must have a very high level of operational  technological and managerial expertise 
in addition  the residential mortgage business has become more capital intensive and therefore access to capital at a competitive cost is critical 
primarily as a result of these factors  the industry has undergone rapid consolidation 
today  large  sophisticated financial institutions dominate the residential mortgage industry 
these industry leaders are primarily commercial banks operating through their mortgage banking subsidiaries 
today  the top mortgage lenders combined have a share of the mortgage origination market  up from five years ago 
following is a year over year comparison of loan volume for the top five originators  according to inside mortgage finance years ended december  institution in billions countrywide wells fargo home mortgage washington mutual chase home finance bank of america mortgage total for top five this consolidation trend has naturally carried over to the loan servicing side of the mortgage business 
today  the top mortgage servicers combined have a share of the total mortgages outstanding  up from five years ago 
following is a year over year comparison of loan volume for the top five servicers  according to inside mortgage finance years ended december  institution in billions countrywide wells fargo home mortgage washington mutual chase home finance citimortgage corp 
bank of america mortgage total for top five comparative data not included for year in which the institution was not in the top five originators 
we believe this consolidation trend will continue  as the aforementioned market forces will continue to drive out weak competitors 
we believe countrywide will benefit from this trend through increased market share 
in addition  we believe that industry consolidation should lessen irrational price competition which from time to time has affected the industry 
compared to countrywide  the other industry leaders are less reliant on the secondary mortgage market as an outlet for adjustable rate mortgages  due to their greater portfolio lending capacity 
this could place us at a competitive disadvantage in the future if the demand for adjustable rate mortgages continues  the secondary mortgage market does not continue to provide a competitive outlet for these loans  and we are unable to develop an adequate portfolio lending capacity 
housing appreciation housing values affect us in several positive ways rising housing values point to healthy demand for purchase money mortgage financing  increased average loan balances  and  a reduction in the risk of loss on sale of foreclosed real estate in the event a loan defaults 
however  as housing values appreciate  prepayments of existing mortgages tend to increase as mortgagors look to monetize the additional equity in their homes 
over the last several years  the housing price index has significantly outpaced the consumer price index and growth in personal income 
consequently  we expect housing values to increase at a slower rate in the coming years than in the past several years 
although there may be some markets that experience housing price depreciation  we believe that price depreciation will not occur nationwide 
over the long term  we expect that housing appreciation will be positively correlated with both consumer price inflation and growth in personal income 
regulatory trends the regulatory environments in which we operate have an impact on the activities in which we may engage  how the activities may be carried out and the profitability of those activities 
therefore  changes to laws  regulations or regulatory policies can affect whether and to what extent we are able to operate profitably 
for example  proposed state and federal legislation targeted at predatory lending could have the unintended consequence of raising the cost or otherwise reducing the availability of mortgage credit for those potential borrowers with less than prime quality credit histories 
this could result in a reduction of otherwise legitimate nonprime lending opportunities 
similarly  certain proposed state and federal privacy legislation requiring notice to consumers of a potential compromise of the security of personal information  if passed  could have an adverse impact on our reputation in the event notice is required 
mortgage originations following is the estimated total united states mortgage originations market for each of the last five years united states mortgage calendar year originations in billions source mortgage bankers association forecasters currently put the market for at between trillion and trillion 
the forecasted reduction is attributable to an expected decline in mortgage refinance activity 
we believe that a market within the forecasted range would still be favorable for our loan production business  although we would expect increased competitive pressures to have some impact on its profitability 
this forecast would imply lessening pressure on our loan servicing business due to a reduction in mortgage loan prepayment activity 
in our capital markets segment business  such a drop in mortgage originations would likely result in a reduction in mortgage securities trading and underwriting volume  which would have a negative impact on profitability 
implementation of new accounting standards in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was amended in december fin r 
fin r is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin r requires business enterprises to consolidate variable interest entities which have one or more of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur fin r excludes qualifying special purpose entities subject to the reporting requirements of sfas fin r applies upon formation to variable interest entities created after january   and to all variable interest entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  as discussed in note notes payable junior subordinated debentures  the company has issued trust preferred securities 
based on guidance related to fin r  during the quarter ending march   the company ceased consolidating the subsidiaries which issued the trust preferred securities 
the primary effect of this deconsolidation was for the company to reclassify the trust preferred securities from mezzanine equity to debt 
in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
sop applies to loans acquired in a transfer if both of the following apply it is probable at the acquisition date that the investor will not be able to collect all of the contractual cash flows of the loan there has been deterioration of the borrower s credit quality 
sop prohibits the carryover or creation of a valuation allowance or loan allowance in the initial accounting for the purchase 
sop allows recognition of interest income on these loans if a reasonable estimate of the amount and timing of cash flows is available 
the requirements of sop are consistent with our existing accounting for purchases of impaired loans as part of our capital markets segment activities 
therefore we do not expect the adoption of sop to have a significant affect our financial condition or earnings 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached consensus opinions regarding the determination of whether an investment is considered impaired  whether the identified impairment is considered other than temporary  how to measure other than temporary impairment  and how to disclose unrealized losses on investments that are not other than temporarily impaired 
the consensus opinions  detailed in emerging issues task force issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf  add to the company s impairment assessment requirements detailed in emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained interests in securitized financial assets 
we have included the new disclosure requirements of eitf in our financial statements 
adoption of the new measurement requirements has been delayed by the fasb pending reconsideration of implementation guidance relating to debt securities that are impaired solely due to interest rates and or sector spreads 
late in  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share eitf 
the consensus requires that all instruments that have embedded conversion features that are contingent on market conditions indexed to an issuer s share price should be included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive regardless of whether the market conditions have been met 
the consensus includes instruments that have more than one contingency if one of the contingencies is based on market conditions indexed to the issuer s share price and that instrument can be converted to shares based on achieving a market condition that is  the conversion is not dependent on a substantive non market based contingency 
the application of this consensus is required beginning with the december  reporting period 
countrywide s liquid yield option notes and convertible securities  described in note notes payable  meet the criteria of eitf therefore  earnings per share amounts have been recalculated and restated as appropriate for all periods presented 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r is focused primarily on accounting for share based compensation 
this statement requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
sfas r requires measurement of the fair value of the options using an option pricing model that takes into account the awarded options unique characteristics 
sfas r requires charging the recognized cost to expense over the period the employee provides services to earn the award generally the vesting period for the award 
sfas r s measurement requirements are similar to those of sfas  which is the basis for the pro forma stock based compensation disclosure contained in note summary of significant accounting policies in the financial section of this report 
however  sfas r requires initial and ongoing estimates of the amount of shares that will vest sfas provided entities the alternative of assuming that all shares would vest and then truing up compensation cost and expense as shares were forfeited adjusting the cost of a modified award with reference to the difference in the fair value of the modified award to the initial award at the date of modification of the award sfas r also provides for the use of alternative models to determine compensation cost related to stock option grants 
the model we will use to value our employee stock options has not yet been selected  and therefore any financial impacts of a model change cannot be determined 
however  we do not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a significant impact on our financial position or earnings 
the provisions of sfas r are applicable to us in the quarter ending september  forward looking statements factors that may affect our future results we make forward looking statements in this report and in other reports we file with the sec 
in addition  we make forward looking statements in press releases and our management may make forward looking statements orally to analysts  investors  the media and others 
generally  forward looking statements include projections of our revenues  income  earnings per share  capital expenditures  dividends  capital structure or other financial items descriptions of our plans or objectives for future operations  products or services forecasts of our future economic performance descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing forward looking statements give management s expectation about the future and are not guarantees 
words like believe  expect  anticipate  promise  plan and other expressions or words of similar meanings  as well as future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could  or may are generally intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations 
some of these factors are discussed below 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes that occur after the date they are made 
general business  economic and political conditions may significantly affect our earnings our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the united states 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  and the strength of the us economy  as well as the local economies in which we conduct business 
if any of these conditions worsen  our business and earnings could be adversely affected 
for example  business and economic conditions that negatively impact household incomes could decrease the demand for our home loans and increase the number of customers who become delinquent or default on their loans  or  a rising interest rate environment could decrease the demand for loans 
in addition  our business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 
we are particularly affected by the policies of the federal reserve board  which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
the federal reserve board s policies influence the size of the mortgage origination market  which significantly impacts the earnings of our loan production sector and the value of our investment in msrs and other retained interests 
the federal reserve board s policies also influence the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities 
changes in those policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and can have a material effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
political conditions can also impact our earnings 
acts or threats of war or terrorism  as well as actions taken by the us or other governments in response to such acts or threats  could impact business and economic conditions in the united states 
if we cannot effectively manage the volatility of our mortgage banking business  our earnings could be affected the level and volatility of interest rates significantly affect the mortgage banking industry 
for example  a decline in mortgage rates generally increases the demand for home loans as borrowers refinance  but also generally leads to accelerated payoffs in our mortgage servicing portfolio  which negatively impacts the value of our msrs 
we attempt to manage interest rate risk in our mortgage banking business primarily through the natural counterbalance of our loan production and servicing operations 
in addition  we also use derivatives extensively in order to manage the interest rate  or price risk  inherent in our assets  liabilities and loan commitments 
our main objective in managing interest rate risk is to moderate the impact of changes in interest rates on our earnings over time 
our interest rate risk management strategies may result in significant earnings volatility in the short term 
the success of our interest rate risk management strategy is largely dependent on our ability to predict the earnings sensitivity of our loan servicing and loan production operations in various interest rate environments 
there are many market factors that impact the performance of our interest rate risk management activities including interest rate volatility  the shape of the yield curve and the spread between mortgage interest rates and treasury or swap rates 
the success of this strategy impacts our net income 
this impact  which can be either positive or negative  can be material 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations  and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain we have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions 
these critical accounting policies relate to our gain from sale of loans and securities  valuation of retained interests and interest rate management activities 
because of the inherent uncertainty of the estimates associated with these critical accounting policies  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not make significant adjustments to the related amounts recorded at december  for more information  please refer to the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies section in this report 
the financial services industry is highly competitive we operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of economic  legislative  regulatory and technological changes 
competition for mortgage loans comes primarily from large commercial banks and savings institutions 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints 
for example  national banks and federal savings and loan institutions are not subject to certain state laws and regulations targeted at predatory lending practices and we could be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to fulfilling legitimate nonprime credit opportunities 
another competitive consideration is that other companies have lower cost structures and others are less reliant on the secondary mortgage market for funding due to their greater portfolio lending capacity 
we face competition in such areas as mortgage product offerings  rates and fees  and customer service  both at the retail and institutional level 
in addition  technological advances and heightened e commerce activities have increased consumers accessibility to products and services generally 
this has intensified competition among banking as well as nonbanking companies in offering financial products and services  with or without the need for a physical presence 
changes in regulations could adversely affect our business we are heavily regulated by banking  mortgage lending and insurance laws at the federal  state and local levels  and proposals for further regulation of the financial services industry are continually being introduced 
we are subject to many other federal  state and local laws and regulations that affect our business  including those regarding taxation and privacy 
congress and state legislatures  as well as federal and state regulatory agencies  review such laws  regulations and policies and periodically propose changes that could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could  for example  limit the types of financial services and products we offer  or limit our liability or increase our cost to offer such services and products 
it is possible that one or more legislative proposals may be adopted or regulatory changes may be implemented that would have an adverse effect on our business 
our failure to comply with such laws or regulations  whether actual or alleged  could expose us to fines  penalties or potential litigation liabilities  including costs  settlements and judgments  any of which could adversely affect our earnings 
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties  we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements and other financial information 
we also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and  with respect to financial statements  on reports of independent auditors 
for example  in deciding whether to extend credit to institutional customers  we may assume that a customer s audited financial statements conform with gaap and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the customer 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with gaap or are materially misleading 
other factors the above description of risk factors is not exhaustive 
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated include  but are not limited to a general decline in us housing prices or in activity in the us housing market a loss of investment grade credit ratings  which may result in increased cost of debt or loss of access to corporate debt markets a reduction in the availability of secondary markets for our mortgage loan products a reduction in government support of homeownership a change in our relationship with the housing related government agencies and government sponsored enterprises gses changes in regulations or the occurrence of other events that impact the business  operation or prospects of gses ineffectiveness of our hedging activities the level of competition in each of our business segments the occurrence of natural disasters or other events or circumstances that could impact the level of claims in the insurance segment other risk factors are described elsewhere herein as well as in other reports and documents that we file with or furnish to the sec 
other factors that could also cause results to differ from our expectations may not be described in any such report or document 
each of these factors could by itself  or together with one or more other factors  adversely affect our business  results of operations and or financial condition
