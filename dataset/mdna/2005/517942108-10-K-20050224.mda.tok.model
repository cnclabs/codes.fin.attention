table of contents critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  the operating partnership  lhl and its consolidated subsidiaries and partnerships 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized the information available including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements is an estimated contingent lease termination expense of million and an immaterial amount for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the company s litigation with meridien hotels  inc see item legal proceedings 
additionally  included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements is an estimated liability of million related to the company s litigation with meridien hotels  inc see item legal proceedings  an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of million and an estimated deferred tax asset of million as of december  management believes that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized and has determined that no valuation allowance is required 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize 
however  application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may determine these estimates differently  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
revenue recognition for properties not leased by lhl  the company recognizes lease revenue on an accrual basis pursuant to the terms of the respective participating leases 
base rent and participating rent are recognized based on quarterly thresholds  pursuant to the lease agreements 
for properties leased by lhl  the company recognizes hotel operating revenue on an accrual basis consistent with the hotel operations 
for the lansdowne resort  the company defers golf membership fees and recognizes revenue over the average expected life of an active membership currently six years on a straight line basis 
golf membership  health club and executive club annual dues are recognized as earned throughout the membership year 
investment in hotel properties upon acquisition  the company allocates the purchase price of assets to asset classes based on the fair value of the acquired real estate  furniture  fixtures and equipment and intangible assets 
the company s investments in hotel properties are carried at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years for buildings and improvements and three to five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
renovations and or replacements that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation expense to reflect each year with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company lengthen the expected useful life of particular assets  it would be depreciated over more years  and result in less depreciation expense and higher annual net income 

table of contents the company periodically reviews the carrying value of each hotel to determine if circumstances exist indicating impairment to the carrying value of the investment in the hotel or that depreciation periods should be modified 
if facts or circumstances support the possibility of impairment  the company will prepare an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows  without interest charges  of the specific hotel and determine if the investment in such hotel is recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  an adjustment will be made to the carrying value of the hotel to reflect the hotel at fair value 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income  because making an impairment adjustment results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the company does not believe that there are any facts or circumstances indicating impairment in its hotels 
in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  a hotel is considered held for sale when a contract for sale is entered into or when management has committed to a plan to sell an asset  the asset is actively marketed and sale is expected to occur within one year

historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most industry investors consider supplemental measurements of performance to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations 
the company believes that excluding the effect of gains or losses from debt restructuring  extraordinary items  real estate related depreciation and amortization  and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between reits  even though ffo does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders 
however  ffo may not be helpful when comparing the company to non reits 
the white paper on ffo approved by nareit in april defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring  sales of properties and items classified by gaap as extraordinary  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred finance costs and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  cash flow from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
ffo is not a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
ffo does not reflect cash expenditures for long term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred 
ffo may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures  property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties

except for the security deposits required under the participating leases for the two hotels not leased by lhl  the lessees obligations under the participating leases are unsecured and the lessees abilities to make rent payments to the operating partnership  and the company s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to shareholders  is dependent on the lessees abilities to generate sufficient cash flow from the operations of the hotels 
in addition  cash flow from hotel operations is subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these risks include competition for guests and meetings from other hotels  including competition from internet wholesalers and distributors  increases in operating costs including wages  benefits  insurance  property taxes and energy due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset in the future by increases in room rates  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  which may fluctuate and be seasonal  increases in energy costs  airline fares  and other expenses related to travel  which may deter traveling  terrorism alerts and warnings and military actions such as the war in iraq  which may cause decreases in business and leisure travel  and adverse affects of weak general and local economic conditions 
these factors could adversely affect the ability of the hotel operators to generate revenues and therefore adversely affect the lessees of the company s hotels and their ability to make rental payments to the company pursuant to the participating leases and therefore impact the company s liquidity

inflation the company s revenues come primarily from its pro rata share of the operating partnership s cash flow from the participating leases and the lhl hotel operating revenues  thus the company s revenues will vary based on changes in the underlying hotels revenues 
therefore  the company relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and the lessees abilities to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
the hotel operators can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the lessees and hotel operators abilities to raise rates faster than inflation or even at the same rate  as has been the case for the period from the second quarter of through the company s expenses primarily real estate taxes  property and casualty insurance  administrative expenses and lhl hotel operating expenses are subject to inflation 
these expenses are expected to grow with the general rate of inflation  except for property and casualty insurance  liability insurance  property tax rates  employee benefits  and some wages  which are expected to increase at rates higher than inflation  and except for instances in which the properties are subject to periodic real estate tax reassessments

derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effects of interest rate changes 
as of december   approximately including the company s million pro rata portion of indebtedness relating to the company s joint venture investment in the chicago marriott downtown hotel of the company s borrowings were subject to variable rates 
the company limits the risks associated with interest rate changes by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives 
for interest rate exposures  derivatives are used primarily to align rate movements between interest rates associated with the company s hotel operating revenue  participating lease revenue and other financial assets with interest rates on related debt  and manage the cost of borrowing obligations 
the company may utilize derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risk 
the company requires that hedging derivative instruments be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge 
this effectiveness is essential in order to qualify for hedge accounting 
some derivative instruments are associated with the hedge of an anticipated transaction 
in those cases  hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction will occur 
instruments that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the derivative contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked to market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the 
table of contents derivatives are designed to hedge  the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 
to manage interest rate risk  the company may employ options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying exposure 
the company utilizes a variety of borrowings including lines of credit and medium and long term financings 
to reduce overall interest cost  the company uses interest rate instruments  typically interest rate swaps  to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
interest rate differentials that arise under these swap contracts are recognized in interest expense over the life of the contracts 
the resulting cost of funds is usually lower than that which would have been available if debt with matching characteristics was issued directly 
to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  the company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing as of each valuation date 
for the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives  long term investments and long term debt  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including mortgage obligations  bonds and an interest rate swap 
for debt obligations  the table presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the debt securing the indianapolis marriott downtown has been included in fixed rate debt because the company has an interest rate swap in place which is not used for trading purposes and effectively fixes the interest rate on the debt 
thereafter total fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate variable rate debt weighted average interest rate total our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the fact that some of our long term debt consists of variable interest rate loans 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
the table above presents the principal amount of debt maturing each year  including annual amortization of principal  through december  and thereafter and weighted average interest rates for the debt maturing in each specified period 
this table reflects indebtedness outstanding as of december  and does not reflect indebtedness incurred after that date 
our ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of adjustment  our ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
the company employs interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate fluctuations 
on february   the company entered into a three year fixed interest rate swap that fixes the london interbank offered rate at for  of the company s mortgage loan secured by the indianapolis hotel and therefore fixes the mortgage rate at
