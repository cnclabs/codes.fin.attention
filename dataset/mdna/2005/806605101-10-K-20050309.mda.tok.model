patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights overview 
intellectual property protection is critical to schering plough s ability to successfully commercialize its product innovations 
schering plough owns  has applied for  or has license rights to  a large number of patents  both in the us and in other countries  relating to molecules  products  product uses  formulations  and manufacturing processes 
there is no assurance that the patents schering plough is seeking will be granted or that the patents schering plough has been granted would be found valid if challenged 
moreover  patents relating to particular molecules  products  uses  formulations  or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or from marketing alternative products or formulations that might successfully compete with the company s patented products 
outside the us  the standard of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely 
while many countries have reasonably strong patent laws  other countries currently provide little or no effective protection for inventions or other intellectual property rights 
under the trade related aspects of intellectual property agreement trips administered by the world trade organization wto  over countries have now agreed to provide non discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to all patent owners 
it is possible that changes to this agreement will be made in the future that will diminish or further delay its implementation in developing countries 
it is too soon to assess how much  if at all  the company will be impacted commercially from these changes 
when a product patent expires  the patent holder often loses effective market exclusivity for the product 
this can result in a rapid  sharp and material decline in sales of the formerly patented product  particularly in 
table of contents the us however  in some cases the innovator company can obtain additional commercial benefits through manufacturing trade secrets  later expiring patents on processes  uses  or formulations  trademark use  or marketing exclusivity that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws 
schering plough s intellectual property portfolio 
patent protection for certain schering plough molecules  products  processes  and uses are important to schering plough s business and financial results 
for many of the company s products  in addition to patents on the compound  schering plough holds other patents on manufacturing processes  formulations  or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent 
schering plough s subsidiaries own or have licensed rights under a number of patents and patent applications  both in the us and abroad 
patents and patent applications relating to schering plough s significant products  including  without limitation  clarinex  intron a  peg intron  nasonex  zetia and vytorin  are of material importance to schering plough 
worldwide  schering plough sells all major products under trademarks that also are material in the aggregate to our business and financial results 
trademark protection varies throughout the world  with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used  and in other countries as long as it is registered 
registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 
patent challenges under the hatch waxman act 
the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  commonly known as hatch waxman  made a complex set of changes to both patent and new drug approval laws in the us before hatch waxman  no drug could be approved without providing the us food and drug administration fda complete safety and efficacy studies  known as a complete new drug application nda 
hatch waxman authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative medicines without such information upon the filing of an abbreviated new drug application anda 
in an anda  the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only bioequivalence between the generic version and the nda approved drug not safety and efficacy 
absent a successful patent challenge  the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator s patents expire 
however  a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator s nda are invalid or not infringed 
this allegation is commonly known as a paragraph iv certification 
the innovator must then file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents 
if one or more of the nda listed patents are successfully challenged  the first filer of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 
in recent years  generic manufacturers have used paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals  and it is anticipated that this trend will continue 
employees there were approximately  people employed by schering plough at december  marketing activities and competition prescription drugs are introduced and made known to physicians  pharmacists  hospitals  managed care organizations and buying groups by trained professional sales representatives  and are sold to hospitals  certain managed care organizations  wholesale distributors and retail pharmacists 
prescription products are also introduced and made known through journal advertising  direct mail advertising  by distributing samples to physicians and through television  radio  internet  print and other advertising media 
animal health products are promoted to veterinarians  distributors and animal producers 
foot care  otc and sun care products are sold through wholesale and retail drug  food chain and mass merchandiser outlets  and are promoted directly to the consumer through television  radio  internet  print and other advertising media 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and includes other large companies  some substantially larger than schering plough  with substantial resources for research  product development  advertising  
table of contents promotion and field selling support 
there are numerous domestic and international competitors in this industry 
some of the principal competitive techniques used by schering plough for its products include research and development of new and improved products  varied dosage forms and strengths and switching prescription products to non prescription status 
in the us  many of schering plough s products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups  institutions  federal and state government entities and agencies and buying groups seek price discounts and rebates 
governmental and other pressures toward the dispensing of generic products may significantly reduce the sales of certain products when they become no longer protected by patents or data exclusivity arrangements with the fda

of particular importance to schering plough are regulation by the fda  the european medicines agency emea and the ministry of health  labor and welfare mhlw in japan 
in the us  the fda has jurisdiction over all schering plough s businesses and administers requirements covering the testing  approval  safety  effectiveness  manufacturing  labeling and marketing of schering plough s products 
the fda also regulates the conversion of pharmaceuticals from prescription to otc status

these regulatory requirements vary from country to country 
whether or not fda  mhlw  or emea approval has been obtained for a product  approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the us  japan or the european union  as the case may be  must be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries 
the approval process may be more or less rigorous from country to country and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the us approval in one country does not assure that such product will be approved in another country 
failure to comply with governmental regulations can result in delays in the release of products  delays in the approvals of new products  seizure or recall of products  suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products  fines and other civil or criminal sanctions
