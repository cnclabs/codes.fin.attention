in addition  the company embarked on a firm wide cost reduction effort designed to mitigate the effects of its price reductions and to improve overall efficiency and productivity 
during the fourth quarter of  the election was decided and market returns turned positive 
in this improved environment  client asset valuations recovered and daily average revenue trades rose by over third quarter lows

expenses rose by over levels  reflecting the reinstatement of the company s k match and the payment of higher discretionary bonuses  an increased marketing communications investment  and the recognition of million in after tax charges relating to the company s exit from the capital markets business and its cost reduction effort

the company generates cash primarily through the revenues of its brokerage and banking subsidiaries 
these revenues are classified into non trading and trading categories 
the company earns non trading revenues primarily through o asset management and administration fees earned through its proprietary and third party mutual fund offerings  as well as fee based investment management and advisory services  and o interest revenue earned on margin loans  loans to banking clients  and investments 
non trading revenues are impacted by securities valuations  interest rates  the company s ability to attract new clients  and client activity levels 
the company earns trading revenues through o commissions earned for executing trades for clients  and o principal transaction revenues for trading activity in fixed income securities 
trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes  the volatility of equity prices in the securities markets and commission rates

all amounts have been adjusted to reflect the sale of the company s capital markets business 
o net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows

o client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the company 
management considers client assets to be indicative of the company s appeal in the marketplace 
additionally  growth in certain components of client assets eg  money market funds directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues 
o schwab s daily average revenue trades dart is deemed by management to be a key indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of commission revenues 
o management believes that revenue growth  pre tax profit margin  and return on stockholders equity provide broad indicators of the company s overall financial health  operating efficiency  and ability to generate acceptable returns 
o revenue per average full time equivalent employee revenue per fte is considered by management to be the company s broadest measure of productivity 
with the company s restructuring initiatives over the past four years  revenue per fte has steadily improved to  in o revenue on client assets is defined as annualized basis points of revenue per dollar of average client assets 
management believes that this metric is a key measure of the company s ability to broaden the number of services utilized by clients

these fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in third party funds and upon the average daily net assets of the company s proprietary funds 
mutual fund service fees are earned through each of the company s segments

the increase in mutual fund service fees from to was primarily due to higher average assets in and service fees earned on schwab s mutual fund onesource r service 
the increase in asset management and related service fees from to was primarily due to higher asset based fees from certain client relationships  partially offset by a decrease in account fees

commissions the company earns commission revenues by executing client trades primarily through the individual investor and institutional investor segments 
these revenues are affected by the number of client accounts that trade  the average number of revenue generating trades per account  and the average revenue earned per revenue trade 
the decrease in commission revenues from to was primarily due to lower average revenue earned per revenue trade as a result of significant reductions in commission pricing for a wide range of clients in  partially offset by higher daily average revenue trades 
the increase in commission revenues from to was primarily due to higher daily average trades  partially offset by lower revenue per revenue trade

effective in the third quarter of  the company considers reduced exchange trading sessions as half days 
all amounts have been adjusted to reflect the sale of the company s capital markets business 
the company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjusts prices to enhance its competitive position 
the company continues to actively evaluate commission rates and fee structures for certain clients 
net interest revenue net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on certain assets mainly margin loans to clients  investments of segregated client cash balances  loans to banking clients  and securities available for sale and interest paid on supporting liabilities mainly deposits from banking clients and brokerage client cash balances 
net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and hedging strategies 
the company s net interest revenue is earned through each of its segments 
in clearing its clients trades  schwab holds cash balances payable to clients 
in most cases  schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment  and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue 
margin loans arise when schwab lends funds to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities 
pursuant to sec regulations  client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients 
when investing segregated client cash balances  schwab must adhere to sec regulations that restrict investments to us government securities  participation certificates  mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association  certificates of deposit issued by us banks and thrifts  and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities 
schwab s policies for credit quality and maximum maturity requirements are more restrictive than these sec regulations 
in each of the last three years  resale agreements accounted for over of schwab s investments of segregated client cash balances 
the average maturities of schwab s total investments of segregated client cash balances were days for  days for  and days for us trust and schwab bank lend funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans 
these loans are largely funded by interest bearing deposits from banking clients 
the charles schwab corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions  except ratios  and as noted the company s interest earning assets are financed primarily by interest bearing brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients 
other funding sources include noninterest bearing brokerage client cash balances  proceeds from stock lending activities  short term borrowings and long term debt  as well as stockholders equity 
client related daily average balances  interest rates  and average net interest spread are summarized as follows interest earning assets client related and other investments client related average balance outstanding    average interest rate margin loans to clients average balance outstanding    average interest rate loans to banking clients average balance outstanding    average interest rate securities available for sale average balance outstanding    average interest rate average yield on interest earning assets funding sources client related and other interest bearing brokerage client cash balances average balance outstanding    average interest rate 


interest bearing banking deposits average balance outstanding    average interest rate other interest bearing sources average balance outstanding    average interest rate average noninterest bearing portion    average interest rate on funding sources 


summary average yield on interest earning assets average interest rate on funding sources 


average net interest spread the increase in net interest revenue from to was primarily due to higher levels of and changes in the composition of interest earning assets  including increases in margin loan balances  loans to banking clients and securities available for sale  partially offset by higher interest rates on brokerage client cash balances due to changes in the interest rate environment 
the decrease in net interest revenue from to was primarily due to changes in the composition of interest earning assets  including the decline in margin loan balances and the corresponding increase in client related investments 
additionally  the decline in yields on interest earning assets due to changes in the interest rate environment from to was only partially offset by lower yields on funding sources 
since the company establishes the rates paid on brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans  it manages a substantial portion of its net interest spread 
however  the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition 
the company s average net interest spread increased from to as the average yield on interest earning assets  primarily client related investments  increased more than the average interest rate on funding sources 
the company s average net interest spread decreased from to as the average yield on interest earning assets  primarily client related investments  declined more than the average interest rate on funding sources

other revenues are earned through each of the company s segments 
the charles schwab corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions  except ratios  and as noted expenses excluding interest as shown in the table below  total expenses excluding interest increased in primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense and restructuring charges

employees receive variable compensation that is tied to the achievement of specified objectives  primarily related to revenue growth and profit margin 
therefore  a significant portion of compensation and benefits expense will fluctuate with these measures 
the increase in compensation and benefits expense from to was primarily due to higher levels of discretionary bonuses to employees  employee benefits  and incentive compensation 
the decrease in compensation and benefits expense from to was primarily due to a reduction in full time equivalent employees through the company s expense reduction measures and lower levels of employee benefits  partially offset by higher levels of incentive compensation and discretionary bonuses to employees

the increases in professional services expense from to were primarily due to higher levels of consulting fees in several areas  including new and expanded products and services  and information technology projects 
the decreases in depreciation and amortization expense from to were primarily due to increases in fully the charles schwab corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions  except ratios  and as noted amortized assets and the company s restructuring initiatives and other expense reduction measures 
the increase in advertising and market development expense from to was primarily due to the company s increased print and other media spending

liquidity csc csc s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries  as well as cash provided by external financing 
as discussed below  schwab and csc s depository institution subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with csc 
management believes that funds generated by the operations of csc s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting csc s liquidity needs  providing adequate liquidity to meet csc s depository institution subsidiaries capital guidelines  and maintaining schwab s net capital 
based on their respective regulatory capital ratios at december  and  the company and its depository institution subsidiaries are considered well capitalized 
csc has liquidity needs that arise from its senior medium term notes  series a medium term notes  as well as from the funding of cash dividends  acquisitions  and other investments 
the medium term notes  of which million was issued and outstanding at december   have maturities ranging from to and fixed interest rates ranging from to with interest payable semiannually

the funds under this facility are available the charles schwab corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions  except ratios  and as noted for general corporate purposes and csc pays a commitment fee on the unused balance of this facility 
the financial covenants in this facility require csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders equity  schwab to maintain minimum net capital ratios  as defined  and csc s depository institution subsidiaries to be well capitalized  as defined 
management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on its ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 
csc also has direct access to million of the million uncommitted  unsecured bank credit lines  provided by eight banks  that are primarily utilized by schwab to manage short term liquidity 
the amount available to csc under these lines is lower than the amount available to schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to schwab 
these lines were not used by csc in schwab most of schwab s assets are readily convertible to cash  consisting primarily of short term ie  less than days investment grade  interest earning investments the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements  receivables from brokerage clients  and receivables from brokers  dealers and clearing organizations 
client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities

liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts  which were billion  billion  and billion at december    and  respectively 
management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for schwab in the future

to manage short term liquidity  schwab maintains uncommitted  unsecured bank credit lines with a group of eight banks totaling million at december  as noted previously  million of these lines are also available for csc to use 
the need for short term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements and the scheduled liquidation of interest bearing investments 
schwab used such borrowings for days in  with the daily amounts borrowed averaging million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december  to satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the options clearing corporation occ  schwab has unsecured letter of credit agreements with nine banks in favor of the occ aggregating million at december  schwab pays a fee to maintain these arrangements

liquidity risk factors the company manages risk by maintaining sufficient liquid financial resources to fund its balance sheet and meet its obligations 
the company s liquidity needs are met primarily through cash generated by operations  as well as cash provided by external financing 
risks in meeting these needs may arise with fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances  as well as changes in market conditions 
specific risk factors which may affect the company s liquidity position include o a dramatic increase in the company s client lending activities including margin  mortgage  and personal lending which may reduce the company s liquid resources and capital position  o a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts which may affect the amount of the company s liquid assets  and o a significant downgrade in the company s credit ratings which could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 
cash and capital resources the company s cash position reported as cash and cash equivalents on the company s consolidated balance sheet and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under federal or other regulatory guidelines 
timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the company in accordance with applicable regulations

risk management overview the company s business activities expose it to a variety of risks including  but not limited to  those discussed below 
identification  assessment and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the company 
senior management takes an active role in the company s risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying  measuring  and controlling various risks 
oversight of risk management has been delegated to the global risk steering committee  which is comprised of managers who lead major business and control functions 
the global risk steering committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the company s risk exposures  leading in the continued development of the company s risk management policies and practices  and reviewing changes in regulation and other risk related developments 
the global risk steering committee regularly reports on risk management to the audit committee of the board of directors  which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures 
the company also has a number of functional risk sub committees  which report into the global risk steering committee on a frequent basis 
these sub committees include o technology and operations risk committee  which focuses on the integrity of operational controls and operating capacity of the company s technology and operations systems  o financial risk oversight committee  which focuses on the credit exposures resulting from client activity eg  margin lending activities and loans to banking clients  the investing activities of certain of the company s proprietary funds  corporate credit activities eg  the charles schwab corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions  except ratios  and as noted counterparty and corporate investing activities  the company s liquidity  capital resources  interest rate risk  and the market risk resulting from securities positioning activities  o fiduciary risk committee  which focuses on overseeing the activities of the company that are deemed to have a fiduciary component  and o disclosure committee  which focuses on the oversight of disclosure and internal controls 
additionally  the company s compliance  finance  internal audit  legal  and risk and credit management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating  testing and monitoring the company s risk management 
risk is inherent in the company s business 
consequently  despite the company s efforts to identify areas of risk  oversee operational areas involving risk  and implement policies and procedures designed to mitigate risk  there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks 
the following discussion highlights the company s principal risks and some of the policies and procedures for risk identification  assessment  and mitigation 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion on liquidity risk and item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements financial instruments subject to off balance sheet risk  credit risk or market risk for additional discussion on credit risk and market risk 
technology and operating risk technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the company s ability to gather  process and communicate information efficiently and securely  without interruptions 
the company s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the company s success depends  in part  on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs 
to the extent the company experiences system interruptions  errors or downtime which could result from a variety of causes  including changes in client use patterns  technological failure  changes to its systems  linkages with third party systems  and power failures  the company s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted 
additionally  rapid increases in client demand may strain the company s ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity 
to minimize business interruptions  schwab has two data centers intended  in part  to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency 
the company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading  enhancing  and testing its technology systems 
this effort is focused on meeting client needs  meeting market and regulatory changes  and deploying standardized technology platforms 
technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error  employee misconduct  external fraud  computer viruses  terrorist attack  and natural disaster 
employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or company assets  improper use or disclosure of confidential client or company information  and unauthorized activities  such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits 
external fraud includes misappropriation of client or company assets by third parties  including through unauthorized access to company systems and data and client accounts 
the frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase 
the company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk  and uses periodic risk self assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls 
the company maintains backup and recovery functions  including facilities for backup and communications  and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans 
the company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data 
despite the company s risk mitigation efforts  it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure  or fraud or other misconduct  and the precautions taken by the company may not be effective in all cases 
the company may be subject to litigation  losses  and regulatory actions in such cases  and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures 
the company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors  including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology  processing and support functions 
the company manages its exposure to such outsourcing risks through contractual agreements and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance 
the company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies  services  and products 
the company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts  and its brands  through the use of copyrights  patents  trade secrets  and contracts 
from time to time  the company may be subject to litigation claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg  patents 
such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources 
if the company were found to have infringed a third party patent  or other intellectual property rights  it could incur substantial liability  and in some circumstances could be enjoined from the charles schwab corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions  except ratios  and as noted using certain technology  or providing certain products or services 
credit risk credit risk is the potential for loss due to a client or counterparty failing to perform its contractual obligations  or the value of collateral held to secure obligations proving to be inadequate 
the company s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities  securities lending activities  its role as a counterparty in financial contracts  and investing activities  and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the company s proprietary funds 
to mitigate the risks of such losses  the company has established policies and procedures which include establishing and reviewing credit limits  monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties  and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities 
in addition  most of the company s credit extensions  such as margin loans to clients  securities lending agreements  and resale agreements  are supported by collateral arrangements 
these arrangements are subject to requirements to provide additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received 
additionally  the company has exposure to credit risk associated with the company s banking loan portfolios held at us trust and schwab bank 
this client credit exposure is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by account officers and senior line management 
periodic assessment of the validity of credit ratings  credit quality and the credit management process is conducted by a credit review department which is separate from the loan origination and monitoring department 
management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations  delinquencies  non performing loans to banking clients  losses and recoveries 
all are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses  which is reviewed quarterly by senior management 
see item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements loans to banking clients and related allowance for credit losses and financial instruments subject to off balance sheet risk  credit risk or market risk for an analysis of the company s loan portfolios and allowance for credit losses  and for an additional discussion on credit risk  respectively 
schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts 
schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations  mutual funds and other financial institutions even if schwab s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to schwab 
see item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements financial instruments subject to off balance sheet risk  credit risk or market risk 
there were no troubled debt restructurings at december  or as of december   management is not aware of any significant potential problem loans other than the amounts disclosed in item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements loans to banking clients and related allowance for credit losses 
fiduciary risk fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through the breaching of fiduciary duties to a client 
fiduciary activities include  but are not limited to  individual and institutional trust  investment management  custody  and cash and securities processing 
the company attempts to mitigate this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business 
guidance and control are provided through the creation  approval  and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various fiduciary risk committees 
market risk see discussion of market risk at item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
legal and regulatory risk the company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business  and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing 
among other things  these risks relate to the suitability of client investments  disclosure obligations and performance expectations for company products and services  supervision of employees  and the adequacy of the company s controls 
claims against the company may increase due to a variety of factors  such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions  as the company increases the level of advice it provides to clients  and as the company enhances the services it provides to ias 
in addition  the company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and foreign regulatory authorities  and self regulatory organizations  and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex 
the company attempts to mitigate legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
these procedures address issues such as business conduct and the charles schwab corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions  except ratios  and as noted ethics  sales and trading practices  marketing and communications  extension of credit  client funds and securities  books and records  anti money laundering  client privacy  employment policies  and contracts management 
despite the company s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls  legal breaches and rule violations  even if unintentional  could result in reputational harm  significant losses and disciplinary sanctions  including limitations on the company s business activities 
potential strategic transactions the company from time to time engages in the evaluation  consideration and negotiation of a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including business combinations  acquisitions and dispositions 
any such transaction could have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  eps  or cash flows 
the process of integrating any acquisition may create unforeseen challenges for the company s operational  financial and management information systems  as well as unforeseen expenditures and other risks  including diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key clients  employees and business partners  and difficulties in managing facilities and employees in different geographic areas 
in addition  an acquisition may cause the company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will realize a positive return on any acquisition or that future acquisitions will not be dilutive to the company s current stockholders percentage ownership or to eps 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us while the majority of the company s revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities are not based on estimates  there are certain critical accounting policies that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and reported financial results 
these critical accounting policies are described below 
management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy 
valuation of goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually  or whenever indications of impairment exist 
an impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  resulting in an impairment charge for this excess 
the company s goodwill balances  net of accumulated amortization  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company has elected april as its annual goodwill impairment testing date 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on april   management estimated the fair value of each of the company s reporting units generally defined as the company s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value  and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired 
the estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit 
adverse changes in the company s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit  or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the company s recorded goodwill 
valuation and estimated useful lives of intangible assets other than goodwill the company s intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill  principally the value of client relationships 
management generally obtains independent valuations to estimate the initial valuation and expected amortization period for client related intangible assets 
these valuations are primarily based on the present value of the estimated net cash flows expected to be derived from the client relationships  and assumptions about future client attrition 
at each balance sheet date  management compares the actual and estimated attrition for client related intangible assets to evaluate whether revisions to the amortization period are necessary 
also  management evaluates the client related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
therefore  higher than expected client attrition may result in higher future amortization charges or an impairment charge for client related intangible assets 
the company s intangible asset balances  net of accumulated amortization  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the charles schwab corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions  except ratios  and as noted restructuring reserves a portion of the reserves under the company s restructuring initiatives are based on assumptions  including the company s ability to successfully sublease certain real estate properties 
the initial restructuring reserves and any subsequent changes in estimates of such reserves are recorded in restructuring charges on the company s consolidated statement of income 
factors and uncertainties which may adversely affect the estimates of sublease income include deterioration in the respective properties real estate markets  including northern california  texas  and new jersey  and prolonged vacancy periods prior to execution of tenant subleases 
the company s total facilities reserves related to its restructuring initiatives were million and million at december  and  respectively 
as of december   the remaining facilities restructuring reserve is net of estimated future sublease income of approximately million 
this estimated future sublease income amount is determined based upon a number of factors  including current and expected commercial real estate lease rates in the respective properties real estate markets  and estimated vacancy periods prior to execution of tenant subleases 
at year end  approximately of the total square footage targeted for sublease under the restructuring initiatives has been subleased  up from approximately at december  the increase in subleased square footage is primarily due to the subleasing of certain property in new jersey to a real estate investment trust in the second quarter of  partially offset by the addition of properties as part of the cost reduction effort 
for a further discussion on the company s restructuring reserves  see description of business restructuring 
pension and other postretirement benefits under us trust s trusteed  noncontributory  qualified defined benefit pension plan  the benefit obligation and related plan assets are based on certain estimates years of employee service  rate of increase in salary  discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets which are made by management with recommendations by actuaries 
in addition to the years of employee service  rate of increase in salary  and discount rate  us trust s postretirement medical and life insurance benefit obligation is based on the health care cost trend rate which is an actuarial estimated rate of future increases in per capita cost of health care benefits 
the company s benefit obligation at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the related pension expense credit is included in compensation and benefits on the company s consolidated statement of income and was million  million  and less than million for   and  respectively 
derivative instruments and hedging activities as part of its asset and liability management process  the company uses swaps to manage interest rate risk 
us trust uses libor based swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with us trust s variable rate deposits from banking clients 
the company has designated these swaps as cash flow hedges  as allowed by sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
therefore  principally all of the cumulative change in the fair value of these swaps from inception  totaling a net million and million liability at december  and  respectively  has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is a component of stockholders equity that is not recognized in current earnings 
any actual hedge ineffectiveness  which was immaterial for  is recorded in interest expense on the company s consolidated statement of income 
in order to maintain hedge accounting treatment  management performs a quarterly assessment of its expectation that these swaps are effective in achieving the desired hedging results 
additionally  the company has entered into swaps that effectively convert the interest rate characteristics of a portion of the company s senior medium term notes  series a medium term notes from fixed to variable 
the company has designated such swaps as fair value hedges  as allowed by sfas no 
since the notional amount  fixed interest rate  and maturity of these swaps exactly match the terms of the corresponding medium term notes  the company has concluded that these swaps are completely effective in achieving the desired hedging results  as permitted under sfas no 
consequently  changes in the fair value of these swaps  totaling an aggregate million and million asset at december  and  respectively  are completely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged medium term notes 
accordingly  there has not been any impact on earnings as a result of this hedging program except for the conversion from a fixed to a floating rate of interest on a portion of the medium term notes 
allowance for credit losses the company regularly evaluates its portfolio of loans to banking clients and provides allowances for the portion management believes may be uncollectible 
several factors are taken into consideration in this evaluation including current economic conditions  the composition of the loan portfolio  past loss experience  and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
for schwab bank and us trust portfolios  which primarily consist of mortgage loans  a risk based methodology is used to determine the allowance for credit losses 
mortgage loans are categorized into portfolios by loan type and risk characteristics 
a probable loss rate  based on company and the charles schwab corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions  except ratios  and as noted industry experience  is used to determine the credit allowance for each portfolio of loans 
at both december  and  the company s allowance for credit losses was million on loan portfolios of billion and billion  respectively 
legal reserve the company is subject to legal  regulatory and other proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of its business 
the company establishes a reserve for potential losses that may arise out of these proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated 
the amount of the reserve  which is determined on a case by case basis  represents the company s best estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case  experience in similar cases  available defenses  insurance coverage  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
however  significant judgment is required in making this estimate and the actual cost of resolving a claim may be higher or lower than the amount of the recorded reserve 
the company s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee 
additionally  the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosures relating to the estimates discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition

the charles schwab corporation item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential for loss due to a change in the value of a financial instrument held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  equity prices  or currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interest earning assets mainly margin loans to clients  investments  loans to banking clients  mortgage backed securities  and other fixed rate investments and its funding sources including brokerage client cash balances  banking deposits  proceeds from stock lending activities  and long term debt which finance these assets 
to mitigate the risk of loss  the company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk  and by monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest earning assets and funding sources 
the company also has the ability to adjust the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans 
additionally  the company uses swaps to mitigate interest rate exposure associated with short term floating interest rate deposits 
the company s exposure to equity price and currency exchange risks is not material 
additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk are summarized in the following paragraphs 
see item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements financial instruments subject to off balance sheet risk  credit risk or market risk for an additional discussion on market risk

interest rate swaps as part of its consolidated asset and liability management process  the company utilizes swaps to manage interest rate risk 
for a discussion of such swaps  see item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements financial instruments subject to off balance sheet risk  credit risk or market risk 
loans held for sale schwab bank s loans held for sale portfolio consists of fixed and adjustable rate mortgages  which are subject to a loss in value when market interest rates rise 
schwab bank uses forward sale commitments to manage this risk

key variables in the model include assumed balance growth or decline for client loans  deposits  and brokerage client cash  changes in the level and term structure of interest rates  the repricing of financial instruments  prepayment and reinvestment assumptions  and product pricing assumptions 
the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and  as a result  cannot precisely estimate net the charles schwab corporation interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies  including changes in asset and liability mix 
as demonstrated by the simulations presented below  the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and  conversely  a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie  interest earning assets are repricing more quickly than interest bearing liabilities 
the simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates 
as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure  in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment 
the following table shows the results of a gradual basis point increase or decrease in interest rates relative to the company s current base rate forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next twelve months at december  and the following table also shows the results of a gradual basis point increase or decrease in interest rates relative to the company s current forecast of net interest revenue over the twelve months ending december  historically  the company had used a gradual basis point change when evaluating its sensitivity  however  the company changed to a basis point simulation in december due to low levels of interest rates 
given the recent increase in interest rates  the company will again report its interest rate sensitivity using a gradual basis point change 
december  increase of basis points decrease of basis points increase of basis points n a decrease of basis points n a n a not applicable 
the down basis point simulation shows reduced exposure to falling interest rates at december  compared to december  this reduced sensitivity results from higher interest rates and an expectation of interest rates continuing to increase  both of which lessen the impact of spread compression between interest earning assets and brokerage client cash balances and banking deposits
