critical accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements goodwill the majority of the company s goodwill resulted from the combination with helix 
on at least an annual basis  the company is required to assess whether its goodwill is impaired 
the company elected to perform this analysis on the first day of its fourth quarter 
in order to do this  management applied judgment in determining its reporting units  which represent distinct parts of the company s business 
the reporting units determined by management are the centers  the network and e commerce 
the definition of the reporting units affects the company s goodwill impairment assessments 
the annual goodwill impairment assessment involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment charge 
calculating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant estimates and long term assumptions 
the company utilized an independent appraisal firm to test goodwill for impairment as of the first day of the company s fourth quarter during and  and each of these tests indicated no impairment 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by applying a weighted average of three methods quoted market price  external transactions  and discounted cash flow 
significant changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions  stock price  interest rates or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of audiological products are recognized at the time of delivery 
revenues from hearing care services are recognized at the time those services are performed 
the company has capitation contracts with certain health care organizations under which the company is paid an amount for each enrollee of the health maintenance organization to provide to the enrollee a once every three years discount on certain hearing products and services 
the amount paid to the company by the healthcare organization is calculated on a per capita basis and is referred to as capitation revenue 
capitation revenue is earned as a result of agreeing to provide services to members without regard to the actual amount of service provided  revenue is recorded in the period that the beneficiaries are entitled to hearing care services 
allowance for doubtful accounts certain of the accounts receivable of the company are from health insurance and managed care organizations and government agencies 
these organizations could take up to nine months before paying a claim made by the company and also impose a limit on the time the claim can be billed 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts 
that estimate is based on historical collection experience  current economic and market conditions  and a review of the current status of each customer s trade accounts receivable 
in order to calculate that allowance  the company first identifies any known uncollectible amounts in its accounts receivable listing and charges them against the existing allowance for doubtful accounts 
then a specific percent per plan and per aging categories is applied against the remaining receivables to estimate the needed allowance 
any changes in the percent assumptions per plan and aging categories results in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  an increase of in the percent applied against the remaining receivables would increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately  sales returns the company provides to all patients purchasing hearing aids a specific return period of at least days if the patient is dissatisfied with the product 
the company provides an allowance in accrued expenses for returns 
the return period can be extended to days if the patient attends the company s help program 
the company calculates its allowance for returns using estimates based upon actual historical returns 
the cost of the hearing aid is reimbursed to the company by the manufacturer
