earnings performance compared with for the year ended december   the corporation recorded net income of  a decrease of  or  from net income of  for net income per share for was 
compared with for diluted net income per share was 
for compared with for return on average assets was 
for compared with for return on average shareholders equity was for compared with for net income for was affected primarily by the following factors o the loan loss provision expense increased by  over due to problems associated with several large commercial loans  o mortgage loan brokerage income decreased  because of a significant reduction in residential mortgage loan production  o noninterest expenses decreased by  primarily due to lower commission based salaries and benefits paid for mortgage brokerage staffing  o increased average holdings of loans and investments resulted in a  increase in interest and dividend income  o interest expense was decreased by  primarily due to lower interest rates paid on time deposits and lower funding costs for mortgage brokerage activities  o income tax expense was reduced by  due to the net effect of the factors enumerated above 
net interest income for increased by  over the amount due to increases of  and  in interest income on loans and investment securities  respectively  and decreases of  and  in interest expenses related to time deposits and short term borrowings  respectively 
interest expense for long term debt increased by  in  primarily due to the issuance of  of trust preferred securities by the corporation 
the proceeds of this debt were used primarily to increase the capitalization of some of the subsidiary banks  to fund mortgage loan brokerage production and for other general corporate purposes 
compared with for the year ended december   the corporation recorded net income of  an increase of  or  over net income of  for net income per share for was compared with for diluted net income per share was for and for return on average assets was for compared with for return on average shareholders equity was for compared with for per share income amounts were affected negatively in by the anticipated dilutive effect of the inclusion for the entire year of the one million shares issued to acquire the ridgeway bank 
such shares impacted the calculation of average shares outstanding for only one half of the year 
similarly  the return statistics include the ridgeway bank s average assets and average equity amounts for the full year in  but only one half year of such amounts were included in net income for was substantially influenced by four major factors o interest rates were stable at historically low levels which put pressure on net interest margin but also resulted in extremely heavy volumes of initial financing and refinancing of residential real estate loans refinancing activity diminished significantly in the fourth quarter and continuing call activity by issuers of investment securities  o the corporation recorded twelve months of operations for bank of ridgeway  which was acquired in july of  o the sumter bank opened an additional branch office  and o there were significant increases in noninterest income and expenses  primarily due to increased fee income in crm and the recognition of the results of operations of the ridgeway bank for a full year in compared with only half of a year in net interest income increased significantly for despite a basis point one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent decrease in the net interest margin 
increased volumes of loans and significantly reduced rates paid for interest bearing deposit liabilities offset  to a large extent  the effects of a basis point reduction in the earning assets yield 
cbi s short term borrowings costs increased  however  due to the funding needs of crm 
average short term borrowings for were  more than the average amount for and the rate paid in was slightly higher than in interest expense related to this funding source increased by  in the average rate paid for interest bearing deposits in decreased by basis points from the rate and deposit interest expenses decreased by  to  comprehensive income comprehensive income for   and was   and  respectively 
accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue  expenses  gains and losses be included in net income 
other elements of comprehensive income for the corporation are correlated directly to the effects that changing market rates of interest have on the fair values of the corporation s holdings of available for sale securities 
the resulting changes in unrealized holding gains and losses on such securities are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
those changes in fair value  net of income tax effects  are the only elements of comprehensive income 
net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest income earned and interest expense incurred  is the principal source of the corporation s earnings 
net interest income is affected by changes in the levels of interest rates and by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
during the first six months of and throughout and  market interest rates were generally stable 
beginning in and continuing until late in the second quarter of  the federal reserve board s policy was to provide stimulus to the us economy by first setting  and then maintaining  interest rates at low levels 
the effects of these actions on the corporation were varied 
the corporation s overall funding costs decreased during the period  but there were similar decreases in the yields realized on loans and investments 
the mortgage subsidiary experienced extremely large volumes of originations and refinancing activity  which strained its ability both to fund and to process those transactions until the volume diminished in the fourth quarter of refinancing activity during the first six months of was driven primarily by uncertainty and concern about whether the federal reserve board would begin to cause interest rates to rise  and  if so  the magnitude and timing of those increases 
finally  late in the second quarter of  the federal reserve board implemented a series of measured increases 
net interest income was   and  for   and  respectively 
the amounts of interest income increased in both and  and interest expense amounts decreased 
average earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities amounts increased steadily over those two years  also 
a large percentage of the increase in is attributable to the ridgeway bank acquisition in july the following table presents the average balance sheets  the average yield and the interest earned on earning assets  and the average rate and the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december    and average balances  yields and rates years ended december  interest interest interest average income yields average income yields average income yields balances expense rates balances expense rates balances expense rates dollars in thousands assets interest bearing deposits with other banks   investment securities taxable       investment securities tax exempt    federal funds sold    loans  including held for sale       total interest earning assets       cash and due from banks    allowance for loan losses    premises and equipment    intangible assets    other assets    total assets    liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing deposits interest bearing transaction accounts    savings    time deposits       total interest bearing deposits       short term borrowings    long term debt       total interest bearing liabilities       noninterest bearing demand deposits    other liabilities    shareholders equity    total liabilities and shareholders equity    interest rate spread net interest income and net yield on earning assets    interest income on tax exempt loans and investment securities has not been calculated on a tax equivalent basis 
nonaccruing loans are included in the average balances and income from such loans is recognized on a cash basis 
total interest earning assets yield less total interest bearing liabilities rate 
net yield equals net interest income divided by total interest earning assets 
by year end compared with  gross loans grew  while deposits grew  because the growth in deposit liabilities in has not been sufficient to fund the corporation s growth in loans  management took several actions 
early in the second quarter of  the corporation issued approximately  in long term debt trust preferred securities to enhance the capital positions of some of the banking subsidiaries and to provide a more stable funding source for its mortgage banking operations 
as a result  the corporation reduced its reliance on short term  relatively high cost borrowings in the corporation continues to maintain a short term line of credit with another financial institution which can be used to fund construction mortgage loan demand 
the corporation also changed its asset allocation such that its investments in federal funds sold and securities available for sale decreased significantly by the end of compared this also allowed the corporation to invest significantly more dollars in the higher yielding loan earning asset category 
time deposits are the largest category of the corporation s deposit liabilities 
interest rates paid for such liabilities continued to decrease during accordingly  total interest expense decreased from  in  to  in and to  in the average rates paid for time deposits declined from in to in recent increases in short term market rates of interest are expected to cause the corporation to begin increasing the rates it offers for deposit liabilities 
the trust preferred securities were issued with a variable rate  as well 
as a result  it is expected that the costs of deposits and other funding sources will increase in the table volume and rate variance analysis provides a summary of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and changes in rate 
the changes in volume are the difference between the current and prior year s balances multiplied by the prior year s rate 
the changes in rate are the difference between the current and prior year s rate multiplied by the prior year s balance 
as reflected in the table  the increases in net interest income during each of the past two years primarily are due to higher volumes of earning assets coupled with reductions in the rates paid on deposit liabilities 
loan growth has been especially prominent in contributing to increases in interest income

in such cases  the entire variance is attributed to volume variance 
although management currently expects that interest rates will increase in  management has not presently identified any factors that it believes might cause interest rates to increase sharply in a short period of time 
however  changes in interest rates that can significantly affect the corporation  positively or negatively  are possible 
in the absence of significant changes in market interest rate levels  any significant changes in net interest income during are expected to result from changes in the volumes of interest earning assets and liabilities 
management expects to continue using its marketing strategies to increase the corporation s market share of both deposits and quality loans within its market areas 
these strategies involve offering attractive interest rates and outstanding customer service 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is charged to earnings based on management s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio and its estimate of the related allowance for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the significant increase in the provision was associated with several large problem commercial loan relationships  most of which were handled by a former lending officer 
the other major component of the increase was a writedown on a large commercial loan which financed the purchase of a business 
following the sale the business did not perform at the level expected by the buyer who has charged the seller with fraud 
net charge offs for were  compared with  and  for and  respectively 
the underlying causes of these problems are believed by management to be isolated and not indicative of a general trend in the loan portfolio 
management continues to monitor these loans and is pursuing all available legal options 
see impaired loans  potential problem loans  allowance for loan losses  and the application of critical accounting policies for further information and a discussion of the methodology used and the factors considered by management in its estimate of the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income noninterest income for decreased by  or from  primarily due to a  or decrease in mortgage brokerage income 
this decrease resulted from a mortgage industry wide slowdown in refinancing activity in the corporation inititated measures in that are intended to decrease the costs and complexity of funding its mortgage brokerage operation 
service charges on deposit accounts were  lower in than in  as well 
this resulted from a slight decrease in the volume of returned check charges and a slowing in demand for the automated overdraft service 
during  gains on the sale of investment securities totaled  compared with losses of  in noninterest income for increased by  or over service charges on deposit accounts increased by  or due primarily to increased service charges assessed on pre arranged overdraft protection services 
also  mortgage brokerage income  primarily fees and gains associated with the origination and sale of mortgage loans for home purchases and refinancing of existing loans  was  in  an increase of  or over the amount 
the mortgage brokerage subsidiary and banks generally obtain take out commitments for mortgage loans originated for resale at the same time that they issue commitments to make loans 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses for decreased by  or from the amount  primarily due to lower expenses for salaries and employee benefits 
such expenses were reduced because of the decline in mortgage loan originations resulting in less commission expense 
noninterest expenses for increased by  or over the amount 
salaries and employee benefits expenses increased by  due primarily to the opening  in february  of a new branch office of the sumter bank and the commission driven compensation system employed by the mortgage brokerage subsidiary 
expenses for premises and equipment increased by  or due primarily to the opening of the branch office  higher expenses associated with the rental of office space for the mortgage brokerage subsidiary s operations  and the acquisition and implementation of imaging equipment and software for customer statement rendering and other purposes 
also  other expenses increased by  approximately of this increase was directly attributable to twelve months of operation of the ridgeway bank compared with only six months during the remaining increases were normal increases associated with the operation of the other banks  the mortgage brokerage subsidiary and the holding company 
income taxes income tax expense for for was  a decrease of  or from the amount 
income tax expense for was  an increase of  or over the amount 
the effective income tax rate income tax expense divided by income before income taxes was   and for  and  respectively 
investment portfolio the corporation s investment portfolio consists primarily of short and intermediate term us treasury and us government agency debt issues 
the acquisition of the ridgeway bank in significantly increased the corporation s tax exempt portfolio

    mortgage backed securities   total     yields on tax exempt securities of states and political subdivisions have not been calculated on a tax equivalent basis 
maturity category based on final stated maturity dates 
average maturity is expected to be substantially shorter because of the monthly return of principal on certain securities 
on an ongoing basis  management assigns securities upon purchase into one of two categories available for sale or held to maturity based on intent  taking into consideration other factors including expectations for changes in market rates of interest  liquidity needs  asset liability management strategies  and capital requirements 
the corporation has never held securities for trading purposes 
no transfers of available for sale or held to maturity securities to other categories were made in any of the years through during  management changed the composition of the securities portfolio  primarily by decreasing the amounts invested in securities throughout the year 
despite investment securities being larger in average amount in  the corporation s investment in such instruments at december  was  less than at december  proceeds from sales and calls of investment securities and reductions in federal funds sold have been used  in part  to fund loan growth in excess of the growth in deposits  short term borrowings and long term debt 
during the years ended december   and  the corporation sold investment securities for gross proceeds of   and  respectively 
realized gains and losses on those transactions were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
securities may be sold to provide liquidity  to reduce interest rate risk  or for other reasons 
there were no sales of held to maturity securities in any of the periods presented 
all mortgage backed securities held by the corporation were issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation  the federal national mortgage association or the government national mortgage association 
loan portfolio management believes the loan portfolio is adequately diversified 
there are no significant concentrations of loans in any particular individual  industry or groups of related individuals or industries  and there are no foreign loans 
the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio by category loan portfolio composition december  dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      consumer installment      total loans gross      risk taking is inherent in the granting of credit 
to control the amounts and types of risks incurred  and to minimize losses  management has established loan policies and practices 
such policies and practices include limitations on loan to collateral values for various types of collateral  requirements for appraisals of real estate collateral  problem loan management practices  collection procedures  and nonaccrual and charge off guidelines 
on an ongoing basis  management is always seeking ways to better manage risk and improve internal control systems 
as part of this continuous process  late in management began seeking a chief credit officer for the corporation 
this position will have specific loan approval authority over major commercial loan relationships and will assist the subsidiary banks in other areas of loan operation and administration 
management is also expanding the nature and scope of its internal loan review system effective in early commercial  financial  and agricultural loans  primarily representing loans made to small and medium size businesses  may be made on either a secured or an unsecured basis 
when taken  security usually consists of liens on inventories  receivables  equipment  and furniture and fixtures 
unsecured business loans are generally short term with emphasis on repayment strengths and low debt to worth ratios 
commercial lending involves significant risk because repayment usually depends on the cash flows generated by a borrower s business  and debt service capacity can deteriorate because of downturns in national and local economic conditions 
management generally controls risks by conducting more in depth and ongoing financial analysis of a borrower s cash flows and other financial information 
each of the banking subsidiaries has a loan committee which is responsible for overseeing the credit granting and monitoring processes 
real estate loans consist of construction loans and other loans secured by mortgages 
because the corporation s subsidiaries are community banks  real estate loans comprise the bulk of the loan portfolio 
loan to value ratios for real estate loans generally are limited to 
the banks generally do not compete with and year fixed rate secondary market mortgage interest rates  so they have elected to pursue the origination of mortgage loans that could easily be sold into the secondary mortgage market 
crm also originates such loans for sale in the secondary market 
these loans are generally pre qualified with various underwriters to facilitate the sales process 
in  and  the corporation sold   and  respectively  of such loans 
the corporation s subsidiaries may originate mortgage loans for their own loan portfolios 
such loans are usually for a shorter term than loans originated to sell and usually have a variable rate or reprice within a three to five year term 
consumer installment loans to individuals are generally for personal  automobile  or household purposes and may be secured or unsecured 
the corporation has a geographic concentration of loans within the banks market areas because of the nature of its business 
as of december   the corporation had no other significant concentrations of credit to customers engaged in similar business activities 
unsecured loans the corporation does not aggressively seek to make unsecured loans  since these loans may be somewhat more risky than collateralized loans 
there are  however  occasions when it is in the business interests of the corporation to provide short term  unsecured loans to certain customers 
at december   the corporation had approximately  or of its loan portfolio  in unsecured loans 
as of december   the corporation had approximately  in unsecured loans  or of its loan portfolio 
such loans are made on the basis of management s evaluation of the customer s ability to repay and net worth 
maturity and interest sensitivity distribution of loans the following table sets forth the maturity distribution of the corporation s loans  by type  as of december  as well as the type of interest requirement on loans due after one year

loans which management has identified as impaired generally are nonaccrual loans 
the corporation had no restructured loans in the past five years 
following is a summary of the corporation s nonaccrual and other nonperforming loans nonaccrual and past due loans december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans   accruing loans days or more past due  total    total as a of outstanding loans impaired loans included in non accrual   as of december   approximately  or  of the corporation s nonaccrual loans consisted of the balances of one loan relationship  net of a partial charge off of  problems with information supplied by a third party supporting an appraisal underlying this credit were discovered in the fourth quarter of approximately  or of nonaccrual loans  represents the remaining loan balances included in a former lending officer s portfolio  net of partial charge offs of  management became aware of possible problems in the former officer s portfolio during the third quarter of as of december   approximately  or  of the corporation s nonaccrual loans consisted of one loan relationship 
during the first quarter of  the corporation collected all amounts due under this credit 
gross income that would have been recorded for the years ended december   and  if nonaccrual loans had been performing in accordance with their original terms was approximately   and  respectively 
no cash basis interest income was recognized in  and on non accrual loans 
the corporation s accounting policies on nonaccrual and impaired loans are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
nonaccrual loans and impaired loans were not material in relation to the portfolio as a whole in management is aware of no trends  events or uncertainties that would cause a material adverse change in nonaccrual loans in potential problem loans at december  the corporation s internal loan review process had identified  of the portfolio in various loans  not including loans identified as nonaccrual or days past due and still accruing loans shown above  where information about credit problems of borrowers had caused management to have doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with original repayment terms 
the amount identified does not represent management s estimate of the potential losses since a large portion of these loans are secured by real estate and other collateral 
other real estate other real estate  consisting of foreclosed properties  was   and  as of december   and  respectively 
other real estate is initially recorded at the lower of net loan balance or the property s estimated fair value  net of estimated disposal costs 
the estimate of fair value for other real estate is determined by appraisal at the time of acquisition 
allowance for loan losses the table  analysis of the allowance for loan losses  summarizes loan balances as of the end of each period indicated  averages for each period  changes in the allowance arising from mergers  charge offs and recoveries by loan category  and additions to the allowance which have been charged to expense 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a direct charge to expense 
losses on specific loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which management determines that such loans become uncollectible 
recoveries of previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance

under the provisions of law and regulations governing banks  each bank s board of directors is responsible for determining the adequacy of its bank s loan loss allowance 
in addition  each bank is supervised and regularly examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ or the south carolina state board of financial institutions the state board in the case of the ridgeway bank or the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic 
as a normal part of a safety and soundness examination  bank examiners assess and comment on the adequacy of a bank s allowance for loan losses and may require that changes be made in the allowance 
the allowance presented in the consolidated financial statements is on an aggregated basis and as such might differ from the allowance that would be presented if the corporation had only one banking subsidiary 
the nature of community banking is such that the individual loan portfolios are predominantly composed of small and medium size business and individual loans 
as community banks  there exists  by definition  a geographic concentration of loans within each bank s respective city or county 
management at each bank monitors the loan concentrations and loan portfolio quality on an ongoing basis including  but not limited to quarterly analysis of loan concentrations  monthly reporting of past dues  nonaccruals  and watch loans  and quarterly reporting of loan charge offs and recoveries 
these efforts focus on historical experience and are bolstered by quarterly analysis of local and state economic conditions  which are part of the banks assessment of the adequacy of their allowances for loan losses 
deposits the average deposits for the corporation for the years ended december   and are summarized below average deposits years ended december  average average average average average average balance cost balance cost balance cost dollars in thousands noninterest bearing demand    interest bearing transaction accounts    savings regular    savings money market    time deposits less than    time deposits greater than    total average deposits    deposits are the primary source of funds for the banks lending and investing activities 
deposits are attracted principally from customers within the banks local market areas through the offering of a variety of products with varying features and by offering competitive interest rates 
at december  the corporation had  in certificates of deposit of  or more 
approximately  mature within three months   mature over three through six months   mature over six months through twelve months and  mature after one year 
this level of large time deposits  as well as the growth in other deposits  can be attributed to planned growth by management 
the majority of time deposits  and over is acquired within the company s market areas in the ordinary course of business from customers with standing banking relationships 
it is a common industry practice not to consider time deposits of  or more as core deposits since their retention can be influenced heavily by rates offered 
therefore  such deposits have the characteristics of shorter term purchased funds 
certificates of deposit  and over require that the corporation achieve and maintain an appropriate matching of maturity distributions and a diversification of sources to achieve an appropriate level of liquidity 
short term borrowings the corporation s short term borrowings may consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which generally have maturities ranging from daily to no more than ninety days  and mortgage loan warehouse and general purpose lines of credit payable 
as of december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled  these amounts are secured by pledges of investment securities and the interest rate is subject to change daily 
federal funds purchased totaled  as of december  and are unsecured and mature on a daily basis 
no amounts were outstanding under warehouse lines of credit as of december  summary information about total short term borrowings is provided in the following table 
december  dollars in thousands balance outstanding at end of year    weighted average interest rate at end of the period interest expense maximum outstanding at any month end during the period    average outstanding during the period    weighted average interest rate during the period long term debt the corporation s banking subsidiaries are members of the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb 
as such  they have access to long term borrowing from the fhlb 
as of december   the banks had borrowed a total of  from the fhlb 
the borrowings are secured by blanket liens on all qualifying first lien residential mortgage loans held by the banks  specifically excluding such loans originated for resale on the secondary market 
early in the second quarter of  the corporation sponsored the creation of scb capital trust the trust 
the trust issued trust preferred debt securities totaling  the trust invested the proceeds of its debt issuance by purchasing a like amount of subordinated debentures issued by the corporation 
the amount of the corporation s debt is includible in tier capital for purposes of computing regulatory required capital ratios 
return on equity and assets the following table shows the return on assets net income divided by average total assets  return on equity net income divided by average equity  dividend payout ratio dividends declared per share divided by net income per share  and equity to assets ratio average equity divided by average total assets for the years ended december   and years ended december  return on assets roa return on equity roe dividend payout ratio equity as a percent of assets liquidity liquidity is the ability to meet current and future obligations through liquidation or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional liabilities 
adequate liquidity is necessary to meet the requirements of customers for loans and deposit withdrawals in a timely and economical manner 
the most manageable sources of liquidity are composed of liabilities  with the primary focus of liquidity management being on the ability to attract deposits within the banks market areas 
core deposits total deposits less certificates of deposit of  or more provide a relatively stable funding base 
certificates of deposit of  or more are generally more sensitive to changes in rates  so they must be monitored carefully 
asset liquidity is provided by several sources  including amounts due from banks  federal funds sold  and investments available for sale 
the corporation maintains an available for sale investment securities portfolio 
while investment securities purchased for this portfolio are generally purchased with the intent to be held to maturity  such securities are marketable and occasional sales may occur prior to maturity as part of the process of asset liability and liquidity management 
the corporation also occasionally designates securities as held to maturity 
securities in this portfolio are generally not considered a primary source of liquidity 
management deliberately maintains a relatively short term maturity schedule for its investments so that there is a continuing stream of maturing investments 
the corporation intends to maintain a relatively short term investment portfolio in order to continue to be able to supply liquidity to its loan portfolio and for customer withdrawals 
the corporation has substantially more liabilities maturing in the next months than it has assets maturing in the same period 
the corporation also has legal obligations to extend credit pursuant to loan commitments  lines of credit and standby letters of credit which totaled   and  respectively  at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  based on its historical experience  and that of similar companies  the corporation believes that it is unlikely that so many deposits would be withdrawn  without being replaced by other deposits  and extensions of credit would be required  that the corporation would be unable to meet its liquidity needs with the proceeds of maturing assets  in the ordinary course of business 
the corporation also maintains various federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks and is able to borrow from the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the federal reserve s discount window 
the corporation  through its banks  has a demonstrated ability to attract deposits from its market area 
deposits grew from  as of december  to  as of december  this consistently growing base of deposits is the major source of operating liquidity 
in the opinion of management  the current and projected liquidity position is adequate 
capital dividends the corporation exists as a legal entity distinct from its subsidiaries 
its main sources of revenues consist of service fees and dividends paid to it by the banks 
the banks are subject to various laws and regulations that limit the amounts of dividends that they may pay 
in addition  the corporation and the banks are each subject to regulatory minimum capital adequacy guidelines 
these regulatory restrictions have not historically hindered the corporation s or the banks ability to pay reasonable dividends and no such future restrictions are anticipated 
during the year ended december   the corporation received dividends from the banks totaling  subject to restrictions imposed by state laws and federal regulations  the boards of directors of the banks could have declared additional dividends from their retained earnings of up to approximately  as of december  capital adequacy the federal reserve and federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted risk based capital standards for assessing the capital adequacy of bank holding companies and financial institutions 
under the risk based capital requirements  the corporation and each of the banks are required to maintain a minimum ratio of capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as letters of credit of 
at least half of total capital must be composed of common equity  retained earnings and qualifying perpetual preferred stock and certain hybrid instruments  less certain intangibles tier capital 
the remainder may consist of certain subordinated debt or hybrid capital instruments  qualified preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses tier capital  which  along with tier capital  composes total capital 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities generally are excluded from the calculation of the risk based capital ratios 
to be considered well capitalized under the risk based capital guidelines  an institution must maintain a total risk weighted capital ratio of at least and a tier risk weighted ratio of at least 
each of the federal bank regulatory agencies also has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banking organizations 
pursuant to these requirements  banking organizations generally must maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to adjusted average quarterly assets equal to from to  subject to federal bank regulatory evaluation of the institution s overall safety and soundness 
federal regulators may categorize an institution as less than well capitalized based on subjective criteria 
management believes that there are no conditions or events that would cause the corporation s or the banks capital category to be other than resulting from meeting the minimum ratio requirements 
under the risk based capital standards and pursuant to the provisions of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  federal bank regulatory agencies are required to implement prescribed prompt corrective actions if an institution s capital position deteriorates to specified levels 
the corrective actions become increasingly stringent as the capital position continues to deteriorate 
the banks are each considered to be well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
detailed information on the corporation s and the banks capital positions can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the mortgage subsidiary is also subject to minimum capital requirements to maintain its certification as a hud approved title ii loan correspondent 
certain investor and warehouse credit line agreements require that the mortgage subsidiary maintain its hud certification 
failure of crm to meet its capital requirements could result in a significant limitation of the mortgage subsidiary s ability to originate  fund or sell loans  and therefore could have a direct  material adverse effect on its business and the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   crm exceeded its minimum regulatory capital requirement by approximately  during the first quarter of  the corporation acquired  in proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities 
of this amount   was used to provide additional capital to two of the banks  approximately  was used to repay a short term line of credit of the mortgage subsidiary and approximately  was used to repay the corporation s short term borrowings 
the remainder is being used for the corporation s general corporate purposes 
under current federal reserve policy  the corporation is allowed to treat the trust preferred securities  subject to certain limitations  as capital for capital adequacy purposes 
inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are mostly monetary in nature 
accordingly  the financial results and operations of the corporation are much more affected by changes in interest rates than changes in inflation 
there is  however  a strong correlation between increasing inflation and increasing interest rates 
the rate of inflation  as measured by the average change in the consumer price index  has been moderate  but increasing  over the past several years  about in and in prospects appear reasonable for continued moderate inflation  despite some risk related to energy prices and the political and military situation in the middle east 
although inflation does not normally affect a financial institution as dramatically as it does businesses with large investments in plants and inventories  it does have an effect 
during periods of high inflation there are usually corresponding increases in the money supply and banks experience above average growth in assets  loans  and deposits 
general increases in the prices of goods and services also result in increased operating expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the company presently engages in only limited off balance sheet arrangements 
such arrangements are defined as potentially material transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements which the company has entered into to which an entity unconsolidated with the registrant is a party and  under which the company  whether or not it is a party to the arrangement  has  or in the future may have o any obligation under a direct or indirect guarantee or similar arrangement  o a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets  o derivatives  to the extent that the fair value thereof is not fully reflected as a liability or asset in the financial statements  or o any obligation  including a contingent obligation  arising out of a variable interest as referenced in fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities january  as may be modified or supplemented  in an unconsolidated entity that is held by  and material to  the registrant  where such entity provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit support to  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with  the registrant 
the company s off balance sheet arrangements presently include only commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
such instruments have elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties to these instruments is represented by the contractual  or notional  amount of those instruments 
generally  the same credit policies used for on balance sheet instruments  such as loans  are used in extending loan commitments and letters of credit 
the following table sets out the contractual or notional amounts of those arrangements december  dollars in thousands loan commitments   unfunded commitments under lines of credit   standby letters of credit   loan commitments involve agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and some involve payment of a fee 
many of the commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn  therefore  the total amount of loan commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
each customer s creditworthiness is evaluated on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if any  upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies but may include commercial and residential real properties  accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is the same as that involved in making loan commitments to customers 
as described under liquidity  management believes that its various sources of liquidity provide the resources necessary for the banks to fund the loan commitments and to perform under standby letters of credit  if the need arises 
neither the company nor the banks are involved in other off balance sheet contractual relationships or transactions that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments or significantly impact earnings 
the corporation s contractual cash obligations are summarized in the following table 
december  payments due by period less than total year to years to years after years dollars in thousands contractual cash obligations time deposits     long term debt      operating lease obligations   total      the application of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
management believes that the following policy may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in its application and represents the critical accounting policy used in the preparation of the corporation s financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from the reported results 
provision and allowance for loan losses the corporation is required to estimate the collectibility of its loan portfolio as of each accounting period end and  as a result  provide an allowance for possible loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and any recoveries received on loans previously charged off 
the allowance is decreased by deducting the amount of uncollectible loans charged off 
a considerable degree of judgment is exercised in computing an estimate of the allowance for loan losses 
management s judgment must be applied in assessing the current creditworthiness of the corporation s borrowers and in estimating uncertain future events and their effects based on currently known facts and circumstances 
changes in the estimated allowance for loan losses arising as new events occur or more information is obtained are accounted for as changes in accounting estimates in the accounting period in which such changes occur 
management reviews its allowance for loan losses utilizing three broad loan categories commercial  real estate and consumer installment loans to individuals 
within these categories  the allowance for loan losses is composed of specific and general amounts 
specific allowance amounts are provided for individual loans based on management s evaluation of the corporation s loss exposure taking into account the current payment status  underlying collateral and other known information about the borrower s circumstances 
typically  these loans are identified as impaired or nonperforming  or have been assigned internal risk grades of management attention  special mention  substandard or doubtful 
general allowance amounts are provided for all other loans  excluding those for which specific amounts were determined  by applying estimated loss percentages to the portfolio categorized using risk grades 
these percentages are based on management s current evaluation with consideration given to historical loss experience  general national and local economic and business conditions affecting key lending market areas  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes  portfolio seasoning  and any identified credit concentrations 
the findings of internal and external credit reviews and results from external audits and regulatory examinations are also considered 
the following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses  as of december  through  compared with the percentage of loans in the applicable categories to total loans 
december  dollars in thousands amount allocated to loan category commercial  financial and agricultural     real estate      consumer installment total      december  percentage of loans in category commercial  financial and agricultural real estate consumer installment total the corporation utilizes its risk grading system for all loans held in the portfolio 
this system involves the corporation s lending officers assigning a risk grade  on a loan by loan basis  considering information about the borrower s capacity to repay  collateral  payment history  and other known factors 
assigned risk grades are updated monthly for any known changes in circumstances affecting the borrower or the loan 
the risk grading system is monitored on a continuing basis by management and the corporation s external credit review consultant who is independent of the lending function

as of december  and  approximately  or and  respectively  of the corporation s nonperforming loans consisted of one commercial loan relationship 
the borrower s principals had been involved in a legal dispute among themselves 
the corporation collected all amounts due under this contract during the first quarter of management has established loan and credit policies and practices that are designed to control credit risks as a part of the loan underwriting process 
these policies and practices include  for example  requirements for minimum loan to collateral value ratios  real estate appraisal requirements and obtaining credit and financial information on borrowers 
however  if the capacity for borrowers to repay or collateral values should deteriorate subsequent to the underwriting process  or both  the estimate of the provision and allowance for loan losses might have to increase  thereby decreasing net income and shareholders equity 
during the two year period ending december   commercial loans increased  to  the total of loans secured by real estate mortgages increased by  from  at the end of to  by the end of any significant  prolonged downturn in national and local economic and business conditions could negatively affect the borrowers capacity to repay these loans as well as the value of the underlying collateral 
this scenario would be likely to substantially increase the level of impaired or non performing loans and non earning foreclosed real estate  and increase overall credit risk by shrinking the margin of collateral values as compared with loans outstanding 
another factor that could adversely affect borrowers ability to make payments in accordance with loan terms is the potential for increases in rates charged for loans 
the corporation has a significant amount of variable rate loans outstanding 
in addition  some loans are refinanced at maturity rather than being paid out in a lump sum 
if interest rates were to increase sharply in a short time period  some loan customers might not be able to afford payments on loans made or repriced at the higher resulting interest rates  nor would they necessarily be able to obtain more favorable terms elsewhere 
this could also cause an increase in the amounts of impaired or non performing assets and other credit risks 
management believes that its estimate of the allowance for loan losses  as of december   is sufficient to absorb any losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management will continue to monitor closely the levels of non performing and potential problem loans and will address the weaknesses in those credits to enhance the amount of ultimate collection or recovery of these assets 
impact of recent accounting changes consolidation of variable interest entities fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities vies and determining when a company should include the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements 
fin requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a vie  the assets  liabilities and results of the activities of the vie must be included in the consolidated financial statements of a business enterprise 
this interpretation also requires existing unconsolidated vies to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
vies that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
fin was effective immediately for vies created after january   and to vies in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applied in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to vies in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  this interpretation does not apply to securitization structures that are qualified special purpose entities as defined within fasb statement no 
management does not believe that adoption of this interpretation has had  or will have  any material adverse or beneficial effect on the corporation s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
share based payment sfas no 
revised  sfas r  was issued in december and requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the statement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
several other pronouncements are amended or superseded as well 
sfas r generally requires use of a fair value measurement objective for such transactions and amends sfas no 
to require that excess tax benefits resulting from such transactions be reported as financing cash flows rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies  other than small business filers  as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  various transition methods are available for the restatement of prior period information 
management has not yet decided which of the available transition methods the corporation will employ  and accordingly is unable to estimate the effect of the implementation of this statement on the corporation s financial position or results of operations for any period 
exchanges of nonmonetary assets sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 eliminates an exception to the measurement of such exchanges at fair value for similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for such exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
the provisions of this statement are required to be applied prospectively to exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for such exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after december  it is not expected that adoption and application of the provisions of this statement will have any material adverse or beneficial effect on the corporation s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
eitf issue no 
emerging issues task force eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  requires that companies report information about certain debt and equity securities when the estimated fair values of those securities are less than their cost 
implementation of the guidance contained in paragraphs of eitf issue no

a 
substantially all of the corporation s investment securities are issued by the us government  or by us government agencies and corporations  and generally do not contain provisions that would allow the securities to be settled in such a way that the corporation would not recover substantially all of its cost 
management intends  and believes that it has the ability  to hold such securities until a forecasted recovery of the fair market value  including until maturity 
management does not believe that implementation of this guidance will have any material adverse or beneficial effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the corporation s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  deposit and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the corporation manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk and this risk could potentially have the largest material effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
other types of market risks such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk do not arise in the normal course of community banking activities 
achieving consistent growth in net interest income is the primary goal of the corporation s asset liability function 
the corporation attempts to control the mix and maturities of assets and liabilities to achieve consistent growth in net interest income despite changes in market interest rates 
the corporation seeks to accomplish this goal while maintaining adequate liquidity and capital 
the corporation s asset liability mix is sufficiently balanced so that the effect of interest rates moving in either direction is not expected to be material over time 
the corporation s asset liability committee uses a simulation model to assist in achieving consistent growth in net interest income while managing interest rate risk 
the model takes into account interest rate changes as well as changes in the mix and volume of assets and liabilities 
the model simulates the corporation s balance sheet and income statement under several different rate scenarios 
the model s inputs such as interest rates and levels of loans and deposits are updated on a quarterly basis in order to obtain the most accurate forecast possible 
the forecast presents information over a twelve month period 
it reports a base case in which interest rates remain flat and variations that occur when rates increase and decrease  and basis points 
according to the model  as of december  the corporation is positioned so that net interest income would increase  and net income would increase  if interest rates were to rise basis points in the next twelve months 
conversely  net interest income would decline  and net income would decline  if interest rates were to decline basis points 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates and loan prepayment  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the corporation could undertake in response to changes in interest rates or the effects of responses by others  including borrowers and depositors

interest bearing liabilities with no contractual maturity  such as savings deposits and interest bearing transaction accounts  are reflected in the earliest repricing period possible 
fixed rate time deposits are reflected at their maturity dates 
the static interest rate sensitivity gap position  while not a complete measure of interest sensitivity  is also reviewed periodically to provide insights related to the static repricing structure of the banks assets and liabilities 
at december  on a cumulative basis through twelve months  rate sensitive liabilities exceeded rate sensitive assets by  the liability sensitive position is largely due to the assumption that the banks  in interest bearing transaction accounts  savings accounts  and money market accounts will reprice within a year 
this assumption may or may not be valid  since these accounts vary greatly in their sensitivity to interest rate changes in the market 
rising interest rates would be likely to diminish net interest income of banks in a liability sensitive position if the assumption is valid and in the absence of factors which would be likely to occur 
the market risk table  which follows this discussion  shows the corporation s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the corporation uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments  and prepayment of principal and potential calls 
for core deposits without contractual maturity ie  interest checking  savings and money market accounts  the table presents principal cash flows based on management s judgment concerning their most likely runoff
