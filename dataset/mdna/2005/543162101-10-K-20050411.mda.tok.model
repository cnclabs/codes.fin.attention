item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions  as set forth under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth in the following discussion and under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we continued to face an environment of economic sluggishness and increasing competition during fiscal us economic growth has improved and unemployment has declined 
however  the recovery in california  our primary market  has been more gradual than that of the broader national economy  and the state s unemployment rate remains above the national average 
significant federal and state budget deficits  record government borrowing and rising gasoline prices also have helped create an environment of economic uncertainty  particularly in california 
additionally  the competitive landscape is changing in many of the markets in which we do business 
other large retail drug store chains and mass merchandisers are expanding in our markets  and we are facing increased competition from non traditional channels such as the internet and mail order pharmacies 
in this environment  we have undertaken significant organizational and operational changes 
these changes affect our store operations  merchandising and marketing strategies  information technology systems  compensation arrangements  and senior management organizational structure and responsibilities 
in a difficult and uncertain economy  and a highly competitive market  we believe these changes are necessary to become a stronger competitor and build a foundation for more profitable long term growth 
our changes fall into the following five broad initiative categories supply chain front end sales pharmacy profitability customer service operational processes during the course of fiscal  we made progress on activities to support these five broad strategic initiatives we shifted our front end merchandise mix toward our core categories of health  wellness  beauty and convenience 
we believe this shift strengthens our competitive offering and improves our control over the profitability of our sales 
we will continue to make adjustments to our front end merchandise assortments in an effort to further improve our competitive position and profitability 
we remodeled additional stores during fiscal  bringing the total number of stores with our new look to  or approximately of our chain 
while we are continuing to evaluate the results of our remodel efforts  we have observed improvements in sales  gross profit and operating expenses for our remodeled stores as a group 
we plan to remodel up to an additional stores in fiscal  and by the end of fiscal we anticipate that approximately of our stores including remodels and new stores will reflect our new look 
as part of our customer service enhancement initiatives  we improved our in stock position and store standards  and initiated a program to quantify and measure service on seven key attributes on a weekly basis 

table of contents we implemented work process improvements at our stores that resulted in improved management of inventory and operating expenses 
we will continue to pursue further cost reductions in an effort to better leverage our operating and administrative expenses 
we made significant improvements in technology in our supply chain and our stores 
as part of our supply chain upgrade  we have installed a distribution management system in our two front end california distribution centers and a retail merchandise system in all of our stores 
in fiscal  we plan to begin implementing procurement and allocation systems that will be more integrated with our distribution management and retail merchandise systems  after which we will begin further upgrade efforts  including a store system for ordering  receiving and inventory management 
our goal is to complete these supply chain upgrades in fiscal in our stores  we have begun installing anti theft electronic article surveillance technology  enhanced check stand merchandise scanners  a new time and attendance system and new point of sale payment system capabilities  and we expect to complete these installations in fiscal we also plan to install labor scheduling and labor forecasting systems during fiscal we took several steps to improve our pharmacy profitability  including better buying  increased generic utilization and work flow efficiencies 
we believe that our pharmacy benefit management segment and mail order business will be important to our pharmacy profitability in the future 
we increased the capabilities of rxamerica  our pharmacy benefit management subsidiary  to pursue continued growth in this segment 
we are taking a series of steps to improve the cash flow performance of underperforming stores 
the sales  gross profit  operating margin and cash flow for these stores as a group improved in fiscal compared to fiscal we are continuing to monitor the performance of these stores 
we strengthened the safety culture at longs  resulting in a further reduction in the number of work related accidents 
our workers compensation claims decreased in fiscal from the previous year  and over two years 
we intend to continue to improve our safety culture in an effort to preserve the health and welfare of our employees and reduce our workers compensation costs 
we expect continued economic sluggishness and intense competitive activity in our markets in fiscal we plan to continue to make significant changes to our operations in an effort to further strengthen our competitive position while improving our profitability and long term growth prospects

growth in the number of stores accounted for most of the total sales increase 
higher mail order sales and pbm revenues also contributed to total sales growth 
a strike against three major grocery chains in southern california that began in october and ended in february resulted in increased sales in some of our southern california stores  primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal we estimate that the strike favorably impacted our fiscal same store sales by to percentage points 
pharmacy sales increased in fiscal over fiscal  with same store pharmacy sales increasing 
the increase in same store pharmacy sales was primarily due to an increase in the average retail price per prescription over fiscal  partially offset by a decline in same store prescription volume 
the increase in the average retail price per prescription was lower than in recent years  due in part to the increased utilization of lower priced  high volume generic drugs 
we expect that average retail prices for prescription drugs will continue to rise due to pharmaceutical cost inflation and the continued introduction and usage of newer and more expensive drugs  partially offset by continuing increases in utilization of generic drugs 
the decrease in our same store prescription volume was partially due to declines in allergy and anti ulcer prescriptions following the conversion of claritin and prilosec from prescription to over the counter status  continued health concerns over women s hormone replacement therapy drugs  and a mild cold and flu season on the west coast 
while the conversion of prescription drugs to over the counter status has a negative impact on our prescription volumes  over the long term we expect several favorable industry trends to positively impact our prescription volumes 
these industry trends include an aging us population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs  the growing usage of prescription drugs as preventive therapy by healthcare providers and the introduction of new drugs 
factors that could offset these favorable trends include increasing competition  including competition from the rapidly growing mail order channel  and rising prescription drug costs  which could cause consumers to reduce their purchases of prescription drugs or third party health plans to reduce their coverage of prescription drug costs for their members 
pharmacy sales were of total drug store sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal we expect pharmacy sales to continue to increase as a percentage of total drug store sales as pharmacy sales continue to increase faster than front end sales 

table of contents third party health plans covered of our pharmacy sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal we expect third party sales to remain over of our total pharmacy sales for the foreseeable future due to significant consumer participation in managed care and other third party plans 
the scheduled addition of a prescription drug benefit to medicare in could further increase third party sales as a percentage of total pharmacy sales 
front end sales increased in fiscal from fiscal  with same store front end sales decreasing 
the decline in same store front end sales was partially due to the southern california grocery strike  which favorably affected last year s front end sales 
in addition  as part of our efforts to improve our merchandise offering  we have shifted our front end merchandise mix toward our core categories of health  wellness  beauty and convenience  resulting in lower sales in non core categories 
we will continue to make adjustments to our front end merchandise assortments in an effort to further improve our competitive position and profitability 
a continued industry wide decline in photo processing sales due to consumers continued migration to digital photography technology also adversely affected same store front end sales in fiscal we expect this trend to continue 
the economic environment continues to be difficult in our markets 
over the past year  us economic growth has improved and unemployment has declined 
however  the recovery in california  our primary market  has been more gradual than that of the broader national economy  and the state s unemployment rate remains above the national average 
significant federal and state budget deficits  record government borrowing and rising gasoline prices also have helped create an environment of economic uncertainty  particularly in california 
we anticipate that the economy in california will continue to be difficult in fiscal fiscal versus fiscal sales increased in fiscal over fiscal growth in the number of stores accounted for a increase in total sales  offset by a decrease in same store sales of 
mail order sales and higher pbm revenues also contributed to total sales growth 
we estimate that the southern california grocery strike favorably impacted our fiscal same store sales by to percentage points 
pharmacy sales increased in fiscal over fiscal  with same store pharmacy sales increasing 
the increase in same store pharmacy sales was primarily driven by an increase in the average retail price per prescription over fiscal  partially offset by a decline in same store prescription volume 
the decrease in our same store prescription volume in fiscal was partially due to the conversion of the allergy drug claritin from prescription to over the counter status in december  health concerns over women s hormone replacement therapy drugs and sluggish economic growth 
pharmacy sales were of total retail drug store sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal third party health plans covered of our pharmacy sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal front end sales decreased in fiscal  with same store front end sales decreasing 
the decline in front end sales in fiscal was primarily due to economic weakness and high unemployment  particularly in california  a decline in sales in our photo category  primarily due to consumers continued migration to digital photography technology  supply chain disruptions due to the implementation of a new distribution management system in our northern california distribution center  and the war in iraq  which adversely affected consumer spending in our first fiscal quarter 
increased sales in some of our southern california stores resulting from the grocery strike partially offset these factors 
gross profit fiscal year gross profit thousands gross profit lifo provision thousands 
table of contents fiscal versus fiscal gross profit was of sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a more profitable sales mix  improved inventory management and the increased utilization of generic drugs  which generally have higher gross profit percentages than name brand drugs 
better buying practices resulting from our progress in centralizing procurement  advertising and promotional activities also contributed to our improved gross profit percentage 
continued reductions in prescription drug reimbursement rates from third party health plans  including government sponsored plans such as medi cal  partially offset the increase in our gross profit percentage 
in addition  pharmacy sales have lower gross profit percentages than front end sales  and as pharmacy sales continued to grow as a percent of total sales  our overall gross profit as a percent of sales was adversely impacted 
gross profit in fiscal also included a benefit of million related to the resolution of a pricing dispute with a vendor 
our lifo provision  which is included in cost of sales  was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase of million  which negatively affected our gross profit  was primarily due to higher net inflation compared to last year  when we experienced a deflationary environment in many of our front end categories 
the lifo provision fluctuates with inflation rates  inventory levels and merchandise mix 
we will continue to make adjustments to our front end merchandise assortments in an effort to further improve the profitability of our sales mix 
further  our supply chain initiative includes continuing efforts to improve our buying practices and inventory management and reduce our distribution costs 
we also expect that the utilization of generic drugs will continue to increase 
we expect that continuing reductions in third party reimbursement levels and increasing pharmacy sales as a percent of total sales will at least partially offset these favorable effects on our gross profit percentage 
in addition to the acquisition cost of inventory sold net of merchandise rebates and allowances  we include in bound freight  receiving  warehousing  purchasing and distribution costs  and advertising expenses net of advertising rebates and allowances in our cost of sales 
we classify store occupancy costs as a component of operating and administrative expenses 
our gross profit percentages may not be comparable to those of some other retailers who include distribution and advertising costs in their operating expenses  or store occupancy costs in their cost of sales 
fiscal versus fiscal gross profit was of sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to increased markdowns to reduce merchandise inventories in our non core categories and higher distribution and merchandise costs as a result of the implementation of a new distribution management system in our northern california distribution center and higher than anticipated volume in our southern california distribution center due to the grocery strike 
continued reductions in prescription drug reimbursement rates from third party health plans  including government sponsored plans such as medi cal  increased pharmacy sales as a percent of total sales  increased promotional sales as a percent of total front end sales  and price reductions on more than  high volume items in our core categories also contributed to the decline in our gross profit percentage in fiscal more disciplined purchasing and economies of scale resulting from our progress in centralizing procurement  advertising and promotional activities as part of our initiative to upgrade our supply chain practices partially offset the decline in our gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal also included a benefit of million related to the resolution of a pricing dispute with a vendor 

table of contents in addition  our lifo provision was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in the lifo provision  which had a positive impact on our gross profit as a percentage of sales  was primarily due to lower overall net inflation on our front end merchandise costs during the year 
operating and administrative expenses fiscal year operating and administrative expenses thousands operating and administrative expenses as a percent of sales fiscal versus fiscal operating and administrative expenses were of sales in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal we took a series of steps to improve our productivity and reduce our costs 
these steps included a reduction of our administrative workforce by approximately people in our california offices  store labor savings through workflow and staffing changes  modifications to many of our incentive compensation arrangements and the closure of certain support facilities 
these actions  combined with other ongoing cost reduction efforts  resulted in lower operating and administrative expenses as a percent of sales beginning in the second half of fiscal and continuing through the first half of fiscal our operating and administrative expense rate began to increase in the second half of fiscal  primarily due to a lack of leverage on labor and related benefit costs  which increased primarily due to normal annual wage adjustments  against lower than expected sales 
expenses related to our supply chain improvement efforts and development of our pbm segment and mail order services to support potential future growth also increased our operating and administrative expense rate 
workers compensation and other insurance related expenses decreased million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to fiscal we are self insured for a substantial portion of our workers compensation and general liability costs 
our insurance related expenses during fiscal included a million net decrease in our self insurance reserves  versus a million net increase in those reserves in fiscal  based on third party actuarial valuations of our self insured programs and reserves 
the decrease in our insurance related expenses  including the actuarial reserve adjustments  partially reflected a decline in workers compensation claims and lower costs per claim 
insurance costs across industries have fluctuated significantly over the last several years as a result of rising health care costs  legislative and regulatory changes  economic conditions and terrorism 
last year the california state legislature adopted changes to the state s workers compensation laws in an effort to reduce costs  but the effects of those changes have not yet been fully realized 
we are continuing to develop our company s safety culture in an effort to reduce the number of work related injuries 
our workers compensation claims decreased in fiscal from the previous year  and over two years 
operating and administrative expenses in fiscal included net charges of million  or of sales  for employee termination and other costs associated with the reduction of our administrative workforce and closure of certain support facilities and a voluntary separation program for store managers announced in july  partially offset by gains on the disposition of certain properties 
fiscal versus fiscal operating and administrative expenses were of sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal a decrease in labor costs and related benefit costs reduced our operating and administrative expense rate by of sales 
this decrease was the result of a series of steps we took during the fiscal year to improve our productivity and reduce our costs 
these steps included a reduction of our administrative workforce by 
table of contents approximately people in our california offices  the closure of certain support facilities  store labor savings through workflow and staffing changes  modifications to many of our incentive compensation arrangements and a voluntary separation program for store managers announced in july workers compensation and other insurance related expenses increased million  or of sales  in fiscal over fiscal this increase included a million net increase in our self insurance reserves based on a third party actuarial study of our self insured programs and reserves  particularly workers compensation  in the fourth quarter 
operating and administrative expenses in fiscal included net expenses of million  or of sales  for employee termination and other costs associated with the reduction of our administrative workforce and closure of certain support facilities and the voluntary separation program for store managers  partially offset by gains on the disposition of certain properties 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal over was primarily due to increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures for new stores investments  remodels and improvements to existing stores  supply chain improvements and technology  as well as accelerated depreciation of assets to be removed or replaced in our remodeled stores 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to accelerated depreciation of million in the first six months of fiscal arising from the abandonment of a pharmacy processing system 
our depreciation and amortization expenses include accelerated depreciation for assets to be retired before the completion of their originally estimated useful lives  including assets to be removed or replaced in our remodeled stores 
the amount of accelerated depreciation expenses related to store remodels will vary based on the level and timing of our remodel activities 
provision for store closures and asset impairments the provision for store closures and asset impairments is summarized as follows fiscal year thousands provision for store closures asset impairments total 
table of contents store closures the following is a summary of the provision for store closures and related reserves  which are included in long term liabilities fiscal year thousands reserve balance beginning of year provision for present value of noncancellable lease obligations of stores closed  net of estimated sublease income changes in assumptions about future sublease income and other lease related costs total provision for store closures reserve accretion cash payments for lease related costs  net of sublease income reserve balance end of year stores closed we periodically review store operating results and projections and make decisions to close stores in the normal course of business 
we recognize costs associated with store closures when the related liabilities are incurred 
our calculation of store closure costs includes significant estimates about the amounts and timing of future sublease income 
these estimates are based on our historical experience  the condition and location of the properties  the lease terms and current real estate leasing market conditions 
many of our previously closed stores have long remaining lease terms  with the longest lease term ending february as a result  changes in these assumptions can significantly impact our store closure reserves 
asset impairments in each of the last three fiscal years  we have identified certain underperforming stores with assets whose carrying values exceeded their related undiscounted expected future cash flows 
we have also recorded asset impairment charges for the write off of abandoned store and information technology assets 
in fiscal  we recorded million of impairment charges for underperforming stores to write the related assets down to their estimated fair values 
in fiscal  we recorded million of impairment charges for underperforming stores to write the related assets down to their estimated fair values 
also during fiscal  we recorded asset impairments of million related to the write off of abandoned information technology assets and million related to the long lived assets of the stores we closed during the year 
in fiscal  we recorded million of impairment charges for underperforming stores to write the related assets down to their estimated fair values 
also in fiscal  we abandoned a targeted marketing database that was originally developed as a component of our e retail strategy and recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the remaining net book value of this database 
legal settlements and other disputes in june  we reached an agreement to settle two purported class action lawsuits relating to the calculation of earned overtime wages for certain of our former and current store managers and assistant store 
table of contents managers in california 
the lawsuits alleged that we improperly classified such employees as exempt under california s wage and hour laws 
we denied all liability in these cases  but agreed to the settlement in order to resolve the plaintiffs claims while avoiding protracted litigation 
under the settlement  we made cash payments of million to cover claims by eligible plaintiffs  plaintiff attorneys fees and costs  payments to the named plaintiffs and costs of a third party administrator 
we recorded a charge of million for the total cost of this settlement  including applicable employer payroll taxes  in the second quarter of fiscal we paid these settlement costs in the second half of fiscal we also recorded a gain of million from the favorable settlement of a separate  unrelated class action lawsuit  for which we had filed a claim as a member of the plaintiff class  which alleged unlawful price fixing and market allocation by certain vitamin manufacturers 
we received the settlement payment in the second quarter of fiscal the combined net charge resulting from these two fiscal settlements was million 
in fiscal  we recorded a combined benefit of million related to settlements of a lease related dispute with one of our landlords and a contract dispute with a former service provider 
net interest expense net interest expense was million in both fiscal and fiscal and million in fiscal lower average borrowings in fiscal offset higher interest rates and lower interest capitalization on construction and systems projects compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal was due to higher average borrowings  partially offset by increased interest capitalization on construction and systems projects 
income taxes our effective income tax rate varies based on the level of our pre tax income and the amount and timing of certain tax deductions and credits 
our effective income tax rates were in fiscal  in fiscal and in the lower tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to the benefits of wage and other tax credits  which reduced our effective income tax rate by percentage points 
we expect that our effective income tax rate will be approximately in fiscal cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal  as a result of adopting sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax or per diluted share as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
liquidity and capital resources general our primary sources of liquidity are operating cash flows and borrowings on our line of credit 
we use cash to provide working capital for our operations  finance capital expenditures and acquisitions  repay debt  pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock 
on august   we replaced our million unsecured revolving line of credit with a secured million revolving line of credit with a syndication of banks 
as of january   borrowings of million  with a weighted average interest rate of  were outstanding on the new secured line of credit 
the new agreement  which expires in august  accrues interest at libor based rates and is secured with inventory  accounts receivable and certain intangible assets 
the new agreement contains customary restrictions but no 
table of contents financial covenants and no limitations on capital expenditures or share repurchases if availability of credit remains above a minimum level 
the agreement also includes an option to increase the credit facility s borrowing and letter of credit capacity from million to million  subject to certain conditions 
borrowings on the line of credit do not require repayment until the expiration date but may be prepaid by the company without penalty 
letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under the agreement as of january  we pay a monthly commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit 
additionally  as of january  we had million in outstanding privately placed promissory notes 
these notes  which mature at various dates through  bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
as required by the note agreements  in august we secured our private placement notes on the same basis as the new secured revolving line of credit 
the private placement notes may be redeemed at the company s option prior to their scheduled maturities subject to an early payment premium 
current maturities of million as of january  constitute regularly scheduled principal payments due in fiscal the privately placed promissory notes contain various customary financial covenants and restrictions 
failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions  or with the restrictions included in our secured revolving line of credit  could adversely affect our ability to manage our cash requirements  and could result in higher interest costs and potentially accelerated repayment requirements 
as of january   we were in compliance with the restrictions and limitations included in these provisions 
we believe that cash on hand  together with cash provided by operating activities and borrowings on our line of credit or replacement facilities  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements beyond the next months 
operating cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the changes in our operating cash flows were primarily due to changes in working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities and a higher percentage of deferred income taxes versus taxes currently payable 
net changes in assets and liabilities and deferred taxes favorably affected our operating cash flows by million in fiscal  and unfavorably affected our operating cash flows by million in fiscal and million in fiscal merchandise inventories decreased million in fiscal  after increases of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal reflects improved inventory management in our stores and distribution centers 
inventory levels were higher in fiscal as a result of our efforts last year to remain in stock during the system conversion in our northern california distribution center and the southern california grocery strike 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to lower than anticipated sell through of inventory during the third and fourth quarter of the year 
pharmacy and other receivables decreased million in fiscal  and increased million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the timing of payments from customers in our pbm segment  lease related receivables  third party health plans  and vendors  for amounts associated with our contractual purchase arrangements 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased amounts owed to us from vendors as a result of changes in some of our contractual purchase arrangements  the timing of payments from customers in our pbm segment and increased pharmacy receivables arising from higher sales 
the million increase in receivables during fiscal was primarily due to increased pharmacy receivables arising from higher sales  as well as changes in payment terms for certain of our pbm customers 
changes in current liabilities excluding the current maturities of debt deferred income taxes and other assets and liabilities unfavorably affected our operating cash flows by million in fiscal  versus a 
table of contents favorable impact of million in fiscal and an unfavorable impact of million in fiscal the unfavorable impact in fiscal was due to decreased accounts payable resulting from lower merchandise inventory levels  partially offset by increased accruals for workers compensation and employee compensation and benefits 
the fiscal results also reflect the reclassification of certain income tax amounts from taxes payable to deferred income taxes as a result of the acceleration of certain income tax deductions resulting from tax planning and optimization efforts 
the favorable impact in fiscal was primarily due to increased accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from higher inventory levels and improved payment terms with many of our vendors  increased employee compensation and benefits primarily related to increased workers compensation reserves during the year  and increased taxes payable due to increased current taxes due  and the effect of income tax credits in fiscal which had the effect of lowering taxes payable in fiscal the million decrease during fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses as a result of the resolution of a payment dispute with a vendor for amounts owed as of the end of the previous year  the acceleration of the timing of our payments to certain vendors  and lower taxes payable due to tax credits 
closed stores will continue to impact future operating cash flows negatively as we make payments associated with our non cancelable lease obligations associated with those stores 
however  those payments will be partially  and in some cases fully  offset by sublease rental income and the elimination of the operating cash flow losses that were incurred by the closed stores prior to closure 
the majority of the payments associated with closed stores will occur over their respective remaining lease terms of up to years  with an average lease term of approximately years 
as a result  we do not expect our existing closed store obligations to affect our operating cash flows significantly in any single fiscal year unless we close a significant number of stores in a short period 
our store closure reserves were million as of january  investing cash flows net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures for new stores  store remodels and improvements  equipment  technology and supply chain improvements  partially offset by cash receipts from property dispositions 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was partially due to the timing of expenditures for certain approved projects in fiscal  which will carry over into fiscal the increased level of capital expenditures in fiscal also included investments in store pharmacy robotics and digital photography technology 
cash receipts from property dispositions were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and primarily include the sale of company owned locations as a result of store closures or sale leaseback transactions 
in the future  we may sell additional properties  particularly if we close stores on our company owned properties 
we also may enter into additional sale leaseback transactions to provide funding for a portion of our capital expenditures 
we opened new stores and relocated stores in fiscal  opened new stores and relocated one store in fiscal and opened new stores and relocated stores in fiscal we also remodeled stores during fiscal and stores during fiscal we plan to open approximately to new stores and to remodel up to existing stores in fiscal we expect net capital expenditures in fiscal to be between million and million  primarily for remodels and improvements to existing stores  new store investments  technology and supply chain improvements 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business we may acquire stores  store related assets including pharmacy customer lists  or other complementary businesses 

table of contents financing cash flows net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal our financing activities primarily consist of long term borrowings and repayments  repurchases of common stock  dividend payments and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  we repaid million of long term borrowings  including million of regularly scheduled principal payments on our private placement notes and million under our revolving line of credit 
in fiscal  we increased our revolving line of credit borrowings by million  and made million of regularly scheduled principal payments on our private placement notes 
in fiscal  we repaid million of long term borrowings  including million under our revolving line of credit and million of regularly scheduled principal payments on our private placement notes 
our borrowing levels on our revolving line of credit fluctuate based largely on the levels of our cash flows from operations  capital expenditures and stock repurchases 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a total cost of million under a share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in march in fiscal  we repurchased  shares at a total cost of million under this authorization  in addition to  shares at a total cost of million to complete a previously authorized share repurchase program 
under the repurchase program authorized in march  we are authorized to repurchase up to  additional shares of our common stock through january  for a maximum additional purchase price of million 
we did not repurchase any of our common stock in fiscal any future repurchase of our common stock will depend on existing market conditions  our financial position  and other capital requirements 
our board of directors makes decisions about the declaration of quarterly dividends based on  among other things  our results of operations and financial position 
we have paid regular quarterly dividends of per share per share annually for each of the last three fiscal years 
total dividends were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal proceeds from employee stock option exercises were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increased level of stock option exercises reflects an increasing number of vested options and a higher average stock price 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total see debt  leases and commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information about the above items 
purchase obligations primarily represent outstanding commitments to purchase pharmaceutical inventories from amerisourcebergen corporation under a long term supply contract for use in the normal course of 
table of contents business 
purchase obligations also include merchandise purchase commitments under other long term supply contracts  as well as outstanding commitments under purchase orders issued in the normal course of business 
our other long term liabilities of million as of january  consisted of deferred tax liabilities  deferred rent  capital lease obligations  and store closure reserves 
these items either are not of a contractual nature  such as deferred rent and deferred income taxes  or are included elsewhere in the above table  such as capital and closed store lease obligations 
in addition to the above obligations  we incur substantial cash requirements for the payment of interest and income taxes each year 
payments for interest fluctuate based on our borrowings and interest rates 
our cash payments for interest  net of amounts capitalized  were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal most of our outstanding debt million as of january  bears interest at fixed rates 
borrowings on our unsecured revolving line of credit million as of january  bear interest at libor based rates 
our cash payments for income taxes were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal payments for income taxes fluctuate based on our taxable income and the availability and timing of tax deductions and credits 
we also incur obligations for contributions to our employee savings and profit sharing plan 
we match a portion of our employees voluntary contributions and provide profit sharing contributions to the plan in some years 
our contributions to the plan  which may be made in cash or in shares of our common stock  fluctuate based on the level of participation in the plan by our employees as well as our levels of income 
our contributions to this plan were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal  all of which we funded with shares of our common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not make use of any off balance sheet arrangements that currently have or that we expect are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we utilize operating leases for many of our store locations  and from time to time we engage in sale leaseback arrangements for financing purposes 
we do not use special purpose entities in any of our leasing arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
uncertainties regarding such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements  and actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and reserves our receivables primarily include amounts due from third party providers eg  pharmacy benefit managers  insurance companies and governmental agencies  vendors and our pharmacy benefit management customers 
we maintain an allowance for the amount of these receivables that we estimate to be uncollectible 
our estimates of uncollectible amounts are based on our historical collection experience  current economic and credit conditions and any information available to us indicating that specific accounts are unlikely to be collected 
we 
table of contents have historically collected a relatively high percentage of our accounts receivable  especially pharmacy receivables  and our credit and collection losses have not materially adversely affected us 
however  if the financial condition of our third party providers  vendors or pbm customers deteriorates  we may increase the allowance for uncollectible accounts and our recovery of recorded receivables may be significantly affected 
merchandise inventories we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
if we do not sell the merchandise at expected prices or if we make decisions to significantly reduce or eliminate merchandise items or categories  we may increase the allowance for markdowns and our realization of recorded inventories may be significantly affected 
we use the last in  first out lifo method to determine inventory cost 
the calculation of lifo inventory costs depends on a number of factors  including annual inflation rates and year end inventory levels and merchandise mix  that require estimates during interim periods 
these estimates are subject to substantial variability and may result in significant adjustments  particularly during the fourth quarter  when final inflation rates and inventory levels and mix are determined 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
using our best estimates based on reasonable assumptions and projections  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values if the carrying values of such assets exceed their related undiscounted expected future cash flows 
we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant 
we perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth fiscal quarter  when updated financial projections are available 
if the carrying values of such assets exceed their estimated fair values  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values 
we generally evaluate store specific long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives at an individual store level  which is the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified 
we evaluate corporate assets or other long lived assets that are not store specific at a consolidated entity or segment level as appropriate 
we evaluate goodwill at a reporting unit level in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
geographic regional divisions within the retail drug store segment comprise our reporting units 
since quoted market prices are not typically available for our long lived tangible and intangible assets  we estimate fair values for most assets based on the expected present value of future cash flows 
we estimate future cash flows based on store level historical results  current trends and operating and cash flow projections 
our estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty and may be affected by a number of factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions  the competitive environment and regulatory changes 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we may record significant additional impairment charges in the future 
we recorded impairment charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal store closure reserves effective with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  on january   we recognize a liability for costs associated with closing a store when the liability is incurred 
we record the present value of expected future lease costs  net of estimated sublease future income  when the store is closed 
we record severance and other employee related costs in the period in which we communicate the closure and related severance packages to the affected employees 

table of contents our calculation of store closure costs includes significant estimates about the amounts and timing of future sublease income 
these estimates are based on our historical experience  the condition and location of the property  the lease terms and current real estate leasing market conditions 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we may significantly adjust our store closure reserves in future periods 
we recorded provisions for store closures of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for significant exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law 
it is generally our policy to retain a significant portion of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability  property losses  pharmacist liability  business interruptions and employee health care 
we record provisions for these items based on claims experience  regulatory changes  an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported and other relevant factors 
an independent actuary periodically evaluates our most significant insurance reserves 
we discount reserves for workers compensation and general liability claims to their expected present value using an essentially risk free interest rate 
the projections involved in this estimate are subject to substantial uncertainty because of several unpredictable factors  including actual claims experience  regulatory changes  litigation trends and changes in inflation and interest rates 
if claims are greater than we estimated  or if costs increase beyond what we anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  and we may need to record significant additional expense 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of merchandise and services  net of an allowance for estimated returns  at the time the merchandise is sold or services performed 
the allowance for sales returns is estimated based on our historical experience 
historically  our sales returns have not been significant  but changes in our experience could result in significant additional reserves 
we recognize revenue from our pbm segment when our rxamerica subsidiary has completed its service obligations under its contracts  including the approval or denial of the authorization request to the participating pharmacy 
rxamerica does not take title to prescription drug inventories or assume substantial risks and rewards of inventory ownership or receivable collection 
accordingly  under our existing contracts we recognize pbm revenues from third party health plans net of the reimbursements due to participating pharmacies 
we do not recognize or otherwise reflect in our financial statements co payments made to participating pharmacies by health plan members 
we estimate certain rebate revenues in our pbm segment based on our contractual terms and prescription drug utilization mix 
these estimates are subject to uncertainty and actual results could differ significantly 
vendor rebates and allowances we record merchandise rebates and allowances as a reduction of the cost of inventory and recognize the benefit through cost of sales when we sell the related inventory 
we recognize advertising rebates and allowances as a reduction of advertising expense  a component of cost of sales  when we incur the related advertising expense or complete the required performance 
we defer lump sum payments received from vendors in connection with a contractual arrangement and recognize them over the contract term as a reduction of cost of sales 
some of our contractual arrangements require estimates of the rebate amounts earned and collectible 
if actual rebates and allowances received differ from our estimates  we may be required to record significant adjustments to our rebates and allowances 
other significant accounting policies the above policies are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  generally accepted accounting principles specifically dictate the accounting treatment for a particular

table of contents risk factors you should carefully read the following risk factors 
our ability to successfully implement significant organizational changes  including new supply chain systems and processes  is critical to the ongoing success of our business 
we are currently undertaking a series of initiatives designed to help us respond to the changing needs of our customers while improving our productivity and profitability 
these initiatives include a program to upgrade our supply chain  primarily through technology systems changes 
such organizational and technology systems changes are complex and could cause disruptions that would adversely affect our sales  gross profit and operating and administrative expenses 
for example  the implementation of new distribution management software in one of our front end distribution centers caused some disruption in our supply chain  which adversely affected our front end sales and gross profit during the second half of fiscal our ability to successfully implement these organizational  systems and process changes  which are significant to our operations and business  is critical to our future profitability 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to execute these changes successfully and without significant disruption to our business 
if we are not successful  we may not achieve the expected benefits from these initiatives  despite having expended significant capital and human effort 
furthermore  we may encounter difficulties implementing this amount of change in our organization that could have a negative impact on our implementation plans and project budgets 
we may also determine that additional investment is required to bring our supply chain and related systems to their desired state  this could result in a significant additional investment of time and money and increased implementation risk 
changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices and reduce our sales and profitability 
over the past year  the us economic growth has improved and unemployment has declined 
however  the recovery in california  our primary market  has been slower  and the state s unemployment rate remains above the national average 
significant federal and state budget deficits  record government borrowing and rising gasoline prices also have helped create an environment of economic uncertainty  particularly in california 
deterioration in economic conditions  particularly in california  could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
for example  an increase in unemployment could cause consumers to lose their health insurance  which could in turn adversely affect our pharmacy sales  or a significant increase in prescription co payments could cause consumers not to buy medications 
further  a decrease in overall consumer spending as a result of changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our front end sales 
for example  the significant increase in gasoline prices may cause consumers to reduce their spending on consumable products 
our profit margins are higher on our front end sales than our pharmacy sales and therefore any decrease in our sales of front end products would have a disproportionate negative impact on our profitability 
the retail drug store and pharmacy benefit management industries are highly competitive  and further increases in competition could adversely affect us 
we face intense competition with local  regional and national companies  including other drug store chains  independent drug stores  on line retailers  supermarket chains and mass merchandisers  many of whom are aggressively expanding in markets we serve 
in addition  competition from mail order pharmacies is rapidly intensifying  and some third party health plans require mail order fulfillment of certain medications 
in the pbm industry  our competitors include large national and regional pbms  some of which are owned by our retail drug store competitors 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources  including name recognition and capital resources  than we do 
as competition increases in the markets in which we operate  a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur  which could require us to reduce prices  purchase more effectively and increase customer service to remain competitive 
for example  in fiscal we reduced prices on over  items in core categories in order to better align our prices and improve our competitive position 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete effectively in our markets or increase our sales volume or margins in response to further increased competition 

table of contents changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs continue to reduce our margins on pharmacy sales and could have a material adverse effect on our overall performance 
we are wholly or partially reimbursed by third party health plans for more than of all the prescription drugs that we sell 
pharmacy sales reimbursed by third parties have lower gross margins than non third party pharmacy sales  and third party health plans continue to reduce the levels at which they reimburse us for the prescription drugs that we provide to their members 
furthermore  government sponsored health plans such as medicare and medicaid are making continuing efforts to reduce their costs  including prescription drug reimbursements 
for example  last year the state of california adopted a budget that reduced medi cal reimbursements to health care providers including pharmacies effective september  if third party health plans  including government sponsored plans  continue to reduce their reimbursement levels  our sales and gross profits could be significantly adversely affected 
in addition  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of included new prescription drug benefits and discounts for medicare participants 
if these changes result in lower reimbursement levels for medicare participants  our sales and gross profits could be adversely affected 
structural changes in the retail pharmacy and related industries could adversely affect our operations 
the pharmacy industry is undergoing significant structural changes  including declining third party reimbursement levels  significant changes to government sponsored health plans such as medicare and medicaid  legislative and other initiatives to permit re importation of prescription drugs from foreign countries  and mandatory mail order fulfillment of prescriptions by certain health plans 
these changes could adversely affect our sales and profitability by reducing prescription drug reimbursement levels or by causing consumers to purchase their prescription drugs from other sources 
the significant investments we are making in our stores may not increase our sales and profitability  which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we have recently made and are continuing to make significant investments in our stores in an effort to increase our sales and profitability 
these investments include the installation of new digital photo equipment  pharmacy and other technology  and remodels and other improvements to some existing stores 
these investments require significant capital expenditures and human effort and are largely unprecedented at our company 
we are uncertain about consumer reaction to these changes and therefore we cannot assure you that they will result in increased sales and profitability 
a failure to increase our sales and profitability would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
continued volatility in insurance related expenses and the markets for insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on us 
the costs of many types of insurance  especially workers compensation  employee medical and others have been highly volatile in recent years 
claims costs for workers compensation and other self insured exposures have also increased 
in fiscal  for example  our insurance related expenses increased million over fiscal these conditions have been exacerbated by rising health care costs  legislative changes  economic conditions  terrorism and heightened scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurance providers 
if our insurance related costs continue to increase significantly  or if we are unable to obtain adequate levels of insurance  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are substantially dependent on a single supplier of pharmaceutical products to sell products to us on satisfactory terms 
a disruption in our relationship with this supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we obtain approximately half of our total merchandise  including over of our pharmaceuticals  from a single supplier  amerisourcebergen  with whom we have a long term supply contract that is scheduled to expire 
table of contents in fiscal any significant disruptions in our relationship with amerisourcebergen  deterioration in amerisourcebergen s financial condition  or industry wide changes in wholesaler business practices  including those of amerisourcebergen  could have a material adverse effect on us 
failure to renew or replace our supply contract with amerisourcebergen or another supplier upon its expiration under similar terms and conditions  or to increase our self distribution capabilities relative to the products we currently purchase under this contract  could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our sales and profitability 
our ability to attract and retain pharmacy personnel or develop alternate fill sources is important to the continued success of our business 
our industry is continuing to experience a shortage of licensed pharmacists in the markets in which we operate 
if we are unable to attract and retain pharmacists  our business could be adversely affected 
in order to mitigate this risk we have established centralized prescription fill centers  including one that we operate under a joint venture with amerisourcebergen  and have also installed robotic prescription fill equipment in many of our pharmacies 
the success of these efforts  which cannot be assured  is important to our ability to address the shortage of pharmacists  but additional efforts may be necessary to address this business issue 
other options may be costly  and could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are subject to governmental regulations  procedures and requirements 
our noncompliance with  or a significant change in  these regulations could have a material adverse effect on us 
our pharmacy and pbm businesses are subject to numerous federal  state and local regulations  many of which are new and developing 
these include  but are not limited to  local registrations of pharmacies in the states where our pharmacies are located and applicable medicare and medicaid regulations 
in addition  the health insurance portability and accountability act  or hipaa  imposes certain requirements regarding the protection of confidential patient medical records and other information 
compliance with these regulations  particularly hipaa  requires that we implement complex changes to our systems and processes 
failure to adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties 
furthermore  any new federal or state regulations or reforms  including healthcare reform initiatives or pharmacy benefit management regulation  could adversely affect us 
certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services  and our insurance may not be adequate to cover some claims against us 
pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products and are significantly dependent upon suppliers to provide safe  government approved and non counterfeit products 
although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance  should a product liability issue arise  we cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims  that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future or that the damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability issue will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
our geographic concentration in the western united states presents certain risks that could adversely affect us 
our stores  distribution centers and corporate offices are located in the western united states 
risks prevalent in this region include  but are not limited to  major earthquakes  periodic energy shortages and rising energy costs  and shipping and other transportation related disruptions 
because of our geographic concentration  these risks could result in significant disruptions to our business or increased operating expenses 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
we use debt financing in combination with operating cash flows to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs  dividend payments  share repurchases and other general corporate purposes 
a portion of our debt million at january  bears interest at libor based rates  and therefore an increase in interest rates could increase our interest expense 
we do not currently undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not currently a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we have not purchased and do not currently hold any derivative financial instruments 
depending on the interest rate environment and subject to approval by our board of directors  we may make use of derivative financial instruments or other interest rate management vehicles in the future 
a change in interest rates basis points on our floating rate debt as of january  would have an immaterial effect on our earnings and cash flows and on the fair value of our fixed rate debt
