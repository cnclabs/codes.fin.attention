management believes that based upon the estimates  judgments and assumptions used to determine the allowance for loan losses  that this accounting estimate requires the most subjective and unpredictable judgments  and as such could be subject to revision as new information is available 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered by management as a critical accounting estimate  as it represents management s estimate of probable loan losses  and loans outstanding comprise of our total assets as of december  the estimates used in the determination of our allowance for loan losses include estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans  losses estimated on specifically identified loans  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may change significantly over time 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used in determining the allowance for loan losses and a detailed discussion of factors influencing possible changes in this critical accounting estimate is included in the credit risk management and the allowance for loan losses sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion compares our financial condition at december  to the financial condition at december  and results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying financial statements and related notes as well as statistical information included in this report 
performance overview we continued to achieve significant growth in loans and deposits while producing a record profit in  leveraging our infrastructure to produce significant increases in revenue while maintaining the growth rate of our operating expenses 
this resulted in higher levels of net income  earnings per share  and improved return on average equity 
we recorded net income of million for compared to million for  an increase of marking our highest net income for any year since first mariner s formation  and the fourth consecutive year of record profits 
diluted earnings per share were also the highest in our history  totaling per share for  an increase of from 
per diluted share in the growth in net income and earnings per share resulted as our gross revenue net interest income and noninterest income increased million or  while our noninterest expenses  the provision for loan losses  and income tax expense increased by million or 
our largest category of revenue  net interest income  grew million or due to growth in average earning assets of 
noninterest income decreased million or due to lower levels of mortgage banking revenue of million and lower gains on sales of securities of thousand 
we experienced higher fee income from all other major sources of noninterest income 
our increase in total expenses resulted from higher noninterest expenses of million and an increase in our income tax expense of  our provision for loan losses decreased by  noninterest expense growth was primarily the result of higher salaries and benefit costs  and increased occupancy and equipment expenses to support our growth as well as costs associated with our branch expansion and infrastructure development of finance maryland for the year 
the increase in income tax expense reflects higher net income before taxes  and lower recognition of tax credits  as tax expense in reflected new tax credits awarded in for both and the decrease in our provision for loan losses reflects improved asset quality statistics  which resulted in a reduction in the allowance for loan losses to of total loans as of december  from as of december  return on average assets was for compared to for and for return on average equity for was compared to for and for average equity to average assets was for compared to for and for our total assets increased by million or  reflecting significant increases in loans and investment securities  which were funded by increases in deposits and borrowed funds 
loans outstanding increased by million or  while our deposits grew by million or 
our growth statistics for loans and deposits continue to compare favorably to industry averages  and reflect our continued expansion efforts  execution of our relationship banking strategy  and successful advertising campaigns 
since our inception in  total assets  loans  and deposits have all increased at an average annual compound growth rate of 
stockholders equity increased million or reflecting the retention of s earnings  shares sold and issued for the exercise of options and warrants and our employee stock purchase plan 
these items were offset somewhat by the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase plan  and the reduction in other comprehensive income driven by the decline in the market value of securities classified as available for sale 
we continued to enjoy favorable asset quality in our allowance for loan losses was increased to million and totaled of nonperforming assets as of december   compared to as of december  our ratio of net chargeoffs to average total loans was in  compared to in our ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets decreased to at december  from at december  capital adequacy levels remained strong  exceeding the levels we are required to maintain for well capitalized status as defined by banking regulation 
december  ratios for our capital leverage  tier capital to risk weighted assets  and total capital to risk weighted assets were   and  respectively  compared to   and  respectively  at december  our regulatory capital levels declined as growth rates in total and risk adjusted assets exceeded the growth rate of regulatory capital 
net interest income margins our primary source of earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest expense we pay on interest bearing sources of funds  such as deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income we earn is determined mostly by the average balances volume and the rate spreads between our interest earning assets and our funding sources 
our net interest income increased to million for  a increase from our net interest income of million earned for the increase was attributable to growth in our average earning assets  which increased by million or 
our average loans and loans held for sale increased by to million and our average investments and other earning assets increased by to million 
the increase we achieved in average loans reflects our expansion of commercial and real estate lending activities among middle market borrowers in the baltimore metropolitan area  the bank s continued emphasis on consumer lending  and consumer finance receivables generated by finance maryland 
our average earning asset growth was funded by an increase in our average deposits of million or and average borrowed funds of or 
we increased average deposits due to the continued success of sales and marketing efforts in our retail banking and commercial banking divisions  and emphasis on core deposit growth 
our average borrowed funds increased primarily due to additional short term borrowed funds to support substantial earning asset growth 
for  our interest income increased to million  which represents an increase of million or from million we earned for interest income on loans and loans held for sale grew by million or 
our average balances on loans and loans held for sale increased by million or  and our yields increased basis points to 
the federal reserve shifted its monetary policy during and began to increase market interest rates  which began to stabilize the portion of our loans that are tied to the prime rate 
additionally  increases in the mix of higher yielding loans improved overall yields 
interest income on our investment securities and other earning assets increased million or to million from million 
our average balances on investments and other earning assets increased and our yields on these assets increased by basis points 
interest expense on our deposits totaled million in  a decrease of  or from million for average interest bearing deposits increased  and the average rates we paid on interest bearing deposits declined basis points 
interest expense on borrowed funds increased million to million for  an increase of from million for  as we increased the level of borrowed funds during our average rate paid on borrowed funds decreased basis points 
the key performance measure for our net interest income is the net interest margin  or net interest income divided by average earning assets 
our net interest margin is affected by our loan pricing  our mix of earning assets  and our distribution and pricing of deposits and borrowings 
our net interest margin was for the year ended december  as compared to for the yields we earned on average total earning assets decreased by basis points  while the cost of interest bearing deposits and borrowings we paid decreased by basis points

rate volume analysis below indicates the changes in our net interest income as a result of changes in volume and rates 
changes in interest income and interest expense that result from variances in both volume and rates has been allocated to rate and volume changes in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of change in each 
we maintain an asset and liability management policy designed to provide a proper balance between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities to attempt to optimize interest margins and to provide adequate liquidity for our anticipated needs

our noninterest income for the year ended december  totaled million  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
lower revenue from our mortgage banking activities  and a decline in gains on sales of securities were the primary cause of the decline in noninterest income 
gains on sales of loans decreased by million or compared to the year ended december  total mortgage loans we sold into the secondary market decreased  and pricing spreads on our loans sold decreased 
the decrease in the volume of loans sold was impacted by the rise in mortgage rates during that significantly diminished the demand for refinancing 
our other mortgage banking fees decreased by  or 
origination related income decreased by  while our mortgage servicing revenue increased  and income from reinsurance  appraisal and inspection activities increased by  the decline in our origination related income occurred primarily due to the decline in demand for mortgage refinances 
the increase in appraisal revenue reflects the increased volume of fm appraisals that began operation in fourth quarter service fees on our deposit accounts increased by  or as we increased the number of demand deposit accounts by  or 
pricing on most deposit service charges was unchanged during compared to our atm fees increased by  or  due to increased transaction volume and higher transaction fee pricing for non customers 
we realized net gains of  from the sale of investment securities in  compared to net gains of million for the level of gains on sales of securities for was high from a historical perspective  and was primarily attributable to realized gains of  on sales of securities to raise proceeds for the redemption of our trust preferred securities during income from bank owned life insurance grew by  due to purchases of new policies in late and early crediting rates for life insurance contracts decreased slightly during commissions earned on the sale of nondeposit investment products primarily fixed annuities decreased  due to lower rates offered by insurance carriers which reduced demand for these products

tax credits in included  of prior period benefit 
in september of  we announced that the bank had earned significant state tax incentives through its participation in the one maryland economic development and job creation tax credit programs 
the tax incentives we earned total million based upon a confirmation received from the maryland department of business and economic development 
we will realize the benefits of the incentives in our reported earnings as the credits can be utilized  in accordance with accounting standards that govern the recognition of investment tax credits 
the amount of the credit that we can utilize will be determined by the level of maryland taxable income for the bank only  and will be recognized as a reduction in our income tax expense 
any unused one maryland credits can be carried forward and will expire in the job creation tax credit can be carried forward for five years 
we expect the bank to fully realize the full value of the credits before their expiration 
we have utilized all prior net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes at december  our net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes approximated million and can be offset by the future state taxable income of first mariner bancorp only 
operating loss carry forward tax benefits are in addition to the tax credits discussed above 
currently  we believe that it is more likely than not that the future operations of first mariner bancorp will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the potential utilization of our net operating loss carryforward 
therefore  we have established a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset associated with the net operating loss carryforward of  to reflect this uncertainty 
financial condition at december   our total assets were  million as compared to  million at december   an increase of 
we continued to achieve growth through the development of our bank branching and mortgage loan office network  expansion of our commercial and retail business development efforts  our formation and expansion of finance maryland and successful development and marketing of our deposit and loan products 
our total loans at december  were million  as compared to million on december   which represents an increase of million or 
we achieved growth in every major segment of our loan portfolio  except commercial business loans 
loans held for sale increased by million as we experienced greater origination activity in the later part of compared to investment securities increased by million as our growth in funding sources deposits and borrowings exceeded growth in our loans and we placed our excess funds in investment securities 
our interest bearing deposits decreased by million 
we increased total deposits by million  an increase of from million at december  our borrowings  repurchase agreements  and trust preferred offerings increased by million  and increased the mix of our borrowed funds to of total assets as of december   compared to as of december  loan portfolio our loan portfolio is expected to produce higher yields than investment securities and other interest earning assets  the absolute volume and mix of loans and the volume and mix of loans as a percentage of total earning assets is an important determinant of our net interest margin 
the following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio 
at december  in thousands loans commercial loans and lines of credit commercial residential construction commercial mortgages residential construction consumer residential mortgages consumer total loans the largest increase in our loan portfolio occurred in the commercial mortgage category  which increased by million and commercial residential construction loans increased by million 
growth in these types of our commercial loans reflected successful marketing and sales efforts of the bank s commercial lending unit  a strong regional economy  as well as the continuation of a favorable interest rate environment 
our consumer loans increased by million due to successful marketing campaigns  a favorable economic and interest rate environment  growth in consumer finance receivables generated by finance maryland  and successful cross selling of home equity products to first mortgage customers 
residential construction loans to consumers increased million as our origination activity in this product line also increased and demand for new construction remained high 
our residential real estate loans  which consist primarily of and year adjustable rate mortgages  increased by million 
during  the company identified certain loans previously classified as commercial loans and reclassified them as either construction loans or commercial real estate loans to more closely categorize these loans with the loan purpose 
amounts presented for loan portfolio reflect million reclassified out of the commercial loan category  mostly into the commercial real estate group 
approximately of our loans have adjustable rates as of december  compared to approximately at december   including adjustable rate first mortgages indexed to us treasury obligations and variable home equity lines of credit tied to the prime interest rate 
our variable rate loans adjust to the current interest rate environment  whereas fixed rates do not allow this flexibility 
if interest rates were to increase in the future  our interest earned on the variable rate loans would improve  and if rates were to fall the interest we earn would decline  thus impacting our interest income 
see our discussion under liquidity and interest rate sensitivity below 
the following table sets forth the maturity distribution  classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rate  for our loan portfolio at december  some of our loans may be renewed or repaid prior to maturity 
therefore  the following table should not be used as a forecast of our future cash collections

however  we seek to rely primarily on the cash flow of our borrowers as the principal source of repayment 
although credit policies are designed to minimize our risk  management recognizes that loan losses will occur and the amount of these losses will fluctuate depending on the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio as well as general and regional economic conditions 
our allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses continually based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on non accruing  past due and other loans that we believe require special attention 
for significant problem loans  our review consists of evaluation of the financial strengths of the borrower and the guarantor  the related collateral  and the effects of economic conditions 
reserves against the remaining loan portfolio are based on our analysis of historical loan loss ratios  loan chargeoffs  delinquency trends  previous collection experience  and the risk rating we place on each individual loan along with an assessment of the effects of external economic conditions 
allowance for loan losses allocation  which is set forth below  indicates the specific reserves we allocated by loan type and also the general reserves included in our allowance for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses is a charge applied to earnings in the current period to maintain our allowance at a level we have determined to be adequate based upon factors noted above 
we decreased the amount of our provision in due to improving asset quality trends that allowed us to decrease the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to our total loans to as of december  from as of december  our provision for loan losses totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our allowance for loan losses at december  totaled million  as compared with the december  balance of million  an increase of  or 
we recognized net charge offs of million and million for and  respectively

our process includes updates on all loans that we have rated for risk 
our commercial loans are generally reviewed individually  while large groups of homogeneous loans are reviewed as pools 
our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both qualitative and quantitative 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience by loan type  collateral values  financial condition of borrowers  and other factors 
qualitative factors include judgments concerning general economic conditions that may affect credit quality  credit concentrations  the pace of portfolio growth and delinquency levels 
these qualitative factors are evaluated in connection with our unallocated portion of our allowance for loan losses 
we periodically engage outside firms and experts to independently assess our methodology  and perform various loan review functions 
our methodology employs management s judgment as to the level of future losses on existing loans based on our internal review of the loan portfolio  including an analysis of the borrowers current financial position  the consideration of current and anticipated economic conditions and their potential effects on specific borrowers 
in determining our ability to collect certain loans  we also consider the fair value of any underlying collateral 
however  our determination of the appropriate allowance level is based upon a number of assumptions we make about future events  which we believe are reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that our charge offs in future periods will not exceed our allowance for loan losses or that we will not need to make additional increases in our allowance for loan losses 
as a result of our ongoing review of the loan portfolio  we classify loans as nonaccrual even though the presence of collateral or the borrowers financial strength may be sufficient to provide for ultimate repayment 
we recognize interest on non accrual residential real estate loans only when it is received 
the unallocated allowance is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
such conditions include general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  credit quality trends including trends in delinquencies and nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio categories  recent loss experience in particular loan categories  duration of the current business cycle  bank regulatory examination results  findings of internal loan examiners  and management s judgment with respect to various other conditions including loan administration and management and the quality of risk identification systems 
executive management reviews these conditions quarterly

the increase resulted from the net retention of our earnings of million  and additional paid in capital of million through the purchase of shares by our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
these increases were reduced by the decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of million  and the repurchase of common stock under the stock repurchase plan approved by the board of directors in the change in our accumulated other comprehensive income reflects the decrease in value of our available for sale securities of million net of taxes and the realization of securities gains of  net of taxes 
our banking regulators have implemented strict capital guidelines directly related to the credit risk associated with an institution s assets 
all banks and financial holding companies are required to maintain capital levels based on their risk adjusted assets so that categories of assets with higher deemed credit risks will require more capital support than assets with lower risk 
additionally  capital must be maintained to support certain off balance sheet instruments 
to date  we have provided for our capital requirements mainly through the funds we received from stock offerings and issuances of trust preferred securities 
in the future  we may consider raising capital from time to time through an offering of common stock or other securities 
as reflected in the table for capital ratios  we exceeded our capital adequacy requirements as of december  and and met the requirement for well capitalized under federal banking regulation 
we continually monitor our capital adequacy ratios to ensure that we exceed regulatory capital requirements 
in we issued trust preferred securities totaling million which became eligible as total capital for regulatory purposes 
in  we issued million in trust preferred securities and used a portion of these proceeds to redeem our june issuance of million 
the remaining amount of million became eligible as total capital for regulatory purposes 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information concerning our trust preferred securities 
capital is classified as tier capital common stockholders equity less certain intangible assets plus a portion of the trust preferred securities and total capital tier plus the allowed portion of the allowance for loan losses and the portion of trust preferred securities not included in tier capital 
minimum required levels must at least equal for tier capital and for total capital 
in addition  institutions must maintain a minimum of leverage capital ratio tier capital to average total assets for the previous quarter

see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on the bank s capital adequacy ratios 
interest rate sensitivity and liquidity interest rate sensitivity is an important factor in the management of the composition and maturity configurations of our earning assets and our funding sources 
the primary objective of our asset liability management is to ensure the steady growth of our primary earnings component  net interest income 
our net interest income can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
we may attempt to structure the statement of financial condition so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals 
however  imbalances in these repricing opportunities at any point in time may be appropriate to mitigate risks from fee income subject to interest rate risk such as mortgage banking activities 
the measurement of our interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the techniques used in asset liability management 
interest sensitive gap is the dollar difference between our assets and liabilities which are subject to interest rate pricing within a given time period  including both floating rate or adjustable rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
our management and our board of directors oversee the asset liability management function and meet periodically to monitor and manage the statement of financial condition  control interest rate exposure  and evaluate pricing strategies 
we evaluate the asset mix of the statement of financial condition continually in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  funding sources and liquidity 
our management of the liability mix of the statement of financial condition focuses on expanding our various funding sources and promotion of deposit products with desirable repricing or maturity characteristics 
in theory  we can diminish interest rate risk through maintaining a nominal level of interest rate sensitivity 
in practice  this is made difficult by a number of factors including cyclical variation in loan demand  different impacts on our interest sensitive assets and liabilities when interest rates change  and the availability of our funding sources 
accordingly  we strive to manage the interest rate sensitivity gap by adjusting the maturity of and establishing rates on the earning asset portfolio and certain interest bearing liabilities commensurate with our expectations relative to market interest rates 
additionally  we may employ the use of off balance sheet instruments  such as interest rate swap or caps  to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
generally  we attempt to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities that is appropriate to minimize our overall interest rate risk  not just our net interest margin 
our interest rate sensitivity position as of december  is presented in the following table  rate sensitivity analysis 
our assets and liabilities are scheduled based on maturity or repricing data except for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities that are based on prevailing prepayments assumptions and core deposits which are based on core deposit studies done for banks in the mid atlantic region 
the difference between our rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities or the interest rate sensitivity gap  is shown at the bottom of the table 
as of december   our interest sensitive assets exceeded our interest sensitive liabilities within a one year period by million or of total assets 
as of december   our interest rate sensitive assets exceeded our interest sensitive liabilities by million or of total assets 
the change in our interest rate sensitivity gap occurred due to growth in our earning assets repricing in one year or less  and increases in our funding sources repricing beyond one year 
while we monitor interest rate sensitivity reports  we primarily test our interest rate sensitivity through the deployment of simulation analysis 
we use earnings simulation models to estimate what effect specific interest rate changes would have on our net interest income and net income 
simulation analysis provides us with a more rigorous and dynamic measure of interest sensitivity 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate caps  are included in the analysis 
changes in prepayments have been included where changes in behavior patterns are assumed to be significant to the simulation  particularly mortgage related assets 
call features on certain securities and borrowings are based on their call probability in view of the projected rate change  and pricing features such as interest rate floors are incorporated 
our fee income produced by mortgage banking operations may also be impacted by changes in rates 
as long term rates increase  the volume of fixed rate mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market may decline and reduce our revenues generated by this line of business 
we employ the use of a statistical model to forecast the effects interest rate changes may have on our mortgage loan volume and revenue 
we attempt to structure our asset and liability management strategies to mitigate the impact on net income by changes in market interest rates 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage interest rate risk so as to avoid significant adverse effects on net interest income or net income 
at december   in an assumed increase of basis points over a one year period  our net interest income would decline by  while our net income would decrease by 
if rates were to decline by basis points  our net interest income would increase by and net our net income would increase by 
the difference in results between changes in our net interest income and our net income reflect the forecasted effects on changes in our mortgage banking revenue net of variable costs due to projected changes in interest rates  and does not include strategies we may implement to increase volume or reduce our semi variable or fixed costs should rates increase and revenue decline

impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services
