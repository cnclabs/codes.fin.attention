our customers are primarily manufacturers of semiconductors  passive electronic components and electronic interconnect devices 
our equipment enables these manufacturers to achieve the yield and productivity gains in their manufacturing processes that can be critical to their profitability 
the components and devices manufactured by our customers are used in a wide variety of end products in the computer  consumer electronics  communications and automotive industries 
esi was founded in and is headquartered in portland  oregon 
we believe we are the leading supplier of advanced laser microengineering systems that allow electronics manufacturers to physically alter select device features during high volume production in order to heighten performance and boost production yields of semiconductor devices  passive electronic components and circuitry  flex circuits  high density interconnect hdi circuit boards and advanced semiconductor packaging 
laser microengineering comprises a set of precise fine tuning processes laser trimming  link cutting and via drilling that require application specific laser systems able to meet semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturers exacting performance and productivity requirements 
additionally  we produce high speed test and termination equipment used in the high volume production of multi layer ceramic capacitors mlccs and other passive components  as well as passive component inspection systems 
electronics industry overview the electronic content of everyday items such as computers  communication devices  consumer products and automobiles continues to increase 
for example  markets for consumer oriented electronic products such as wireless telephones  computers  personal digital assistants pdas  digital audio players  digital video recorders  digital cameras and home entertainment devices have developed rapidly as increasingly affordable products have been introduced that are smaller  lighter and more portable 
in addition  automobile manufacturers now routinely include electronic ignition and fuel injection  anti lock brakes  navigation systems and other electronic safety and sensor systems in place of components that in the past were predominantly mechanical or hydraulic 
the increasing demand for electronic products has been accompanied by the need for faster  smaller  more complex  less expensive and higher quality electronic devices and circuits 
to achieve these performance and size improvements  electronic device manufacturers are increasing the circuit densities in these devices and tuning them to precise electrical values 
manufacturers of cellular telephones  for example  must use miniaturized circuits to accommodate the size limitations of their finished products 
these circuits must also be tuned to operate within precise frequency specifications  enabling the existing wireless frequency bands to accommodate more users without interchannel interference 
smaller and lighter requirements also decrease the physical dimensions used in electronic interconnections within the electronic device  its surrounding package and the hdi circuit board on which it is mounted 
higher operating speeds of computers and communications products also require more input and output channels within these packages and between the packages and the hdi circuit board 
the highly competitive consumer markets for electronic products drive the demand for lower cost devices and components 
electronic devices and components are produced in large unit volumes  and their production and testing is highly automated  utilizing a variety of manufacturing equipment 
manufacturers continually seek to reduce costs by improving the throughput  yield and quality of device and component production 
these manufacturers are also developing new materials to improve performance and reduce costs of their devices 
this challenges equipment suppliers to innovate new manufacturing process solutions and equipment 
for example  semiconductor device manufacturers are continuing the transition from mm and smaller silicon wafers to mm wafers  which can accommodate a significantly higher number of electronic devices 
in addition  increasing circuit densities enable more devices to be produced on a silicon wafer by reducing the size of each device on the wafer 
together  larger wafers and smaller device designs significantly reduce the cost of semiconductor devices 
increasing circuit densities which result from shrinking line widths and faster operating speeds require the use of materials such as copper to create these miniaturized and higher performance electronic circuits 
to improve production yield  or the number of acceptable devices produced per silicon wafer  device manufacturers are utilizing advanced systems  such as our laser memory repair products  to boost final yields in the manufacture of devices 
this includes dynamic random access memory dram  nand flash memory and non memory devices  such as logic with embedded memory  digital signal processors and high end electronic game chips 
as semiconductor manufacturers move toward higher densities and more complex architectures  machine vision has also emerged as a critical technology 
by allowing manufacturers to achieve greater precision  increased equipment speed and fewer errors  machine vision is enabling technology in the semiconductor manufacturing process  from wafer production through final assembly and packaging 
moreover  machine vision technology is proving to be integral to applications such as wafer identification 
as the increased functionality of next generation chips continues to drive up total wafer cost  the need to accurately track and identify wafers will become even more critical to chip manufacturers bottom line 
variations of these advanced technologies and manufacturing processes that are routinely used in semiconductor fabs are increasingly being employed in the production of passive components  hdi circuit boards and advanced semiconductor packages 
an example is the use of machine vision in passive component inspection 
as device sizes grow ever smaller and critical dimensions of the electrical contacts become more precise  machine vision  incorporated with high speed handling and real time software  allows for inspection of mlccs at over  parts per hour 
the previous technique utilized human inspection at a much slower rate with poorer inspection results 
in the case of hdi circuit boards  consumers desire for faster  lighter  ultimately less expensive products with longer battery life drives cell phone producers and other consumer product manufacturers to design products in which the discrete circuits are closer together 
the same increased density concept used in semiconductor manufacturing is also pursued in printed circuit board production

consistent with market cycles  we experienced a strong increase in demand for our products during fiscal ending backlog for fiscal was million 
in fiscal  however  we experienced decreases in orders as a result of softening markets for our products 
orders decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal despite the decrease in orders  fiscal shipments of million increased or million compared to million in fiscal as we shipped orders included in backlog at the end of the prior year 
ending backlog was million at the close of fiscal gross margins improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily due to the volume efficiencies related to the increase in shipments 
increased gross profits  combined with improvements in operating expenses resulting from our cost management plans and other economies of scale  led to improvements in both operating and net income  which were million and million  respectively  in fiscal net income in fiscal included a one time charge of approximately million for the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes due operating income for fiscal was million while net income was million  which included a tax benefit of million

this trend began in the latter half of fiscal and continued well into the first half of fiscal strong fiscal sg sales were complimented by an increase of million or in pcg sales over the prior year 
several key customers placed orders to build capacity late in fiscal as a response to anticipated demand for end customer electronics products 
accordingly  fiscal pcg sales benefited significantly from the shipment of ending fiscal backlog 
eig sales increased million or compared to the prior fiscal year 
total net sales decreased sequentially each quarter in fiscal  from million in the first quarter to million in the fourth quarter as the cycle of increasing demand experienced over fiscal softened 
the primary cause for the decrease was a moderate decline in sg sales and a more significant decline in sequential pcg sales 
sg sales volumes decreased in the latter half of fiscal yet remained at levels significantly above those experienced prior to the dram market upturn in fiscal pcg sales also decreased in the latter half of fiscal as manufacturers remained cautious about building capacity 
fourth quarter pcg sales of million were similar to those experienced prior to the market upturn in the first quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we estimate net sales to be in the range of to million 
gross profit gross profit was million of net sales for fiscal compared to million of net sales for fiscal shipments in fiscal increased compared to fiscal the primary driver for increased gross margins compared to fiscal was a volume increase in production  shipments and revenues  which allowed for better factory utilization and improved overhead absorption  which was achieved without an increase in average annual headcount 
in addition  gross margin benefited from efficiency improvements in our manufacturing processes 
the proportionate sales for our three product groups were fairly consistent in fiscal as compared with fiscal as a result  there was no significant impact on gross margins resulting from changes in sales mix 
we estimate gross margins will be approximately in the first quarter of fiscal primarily due to a temporary sales mix shift away from higher margin products and the impact of lower margin sales resulting from an eig product transition  as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal operating expenses selling  service and administrative expenses in thousands selling  service and administration included in totals above legal and professional fees investigation and securities litigation restructuring and cost management plans impact of special charges selling  service and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to million of net sales in fiscal the primary items included in selling  service and administrative expenses are labor  commissions and other employee related expenses  travel expenses  professional fees and facilities costs 
included in selling  service and administrative expenses for fiscal are charges related to our fiscal restructuring and cost management plans of million  consisting primarily of employee severance and related costs 
fiscal expenses of million included million in expenses related to cost management plans 
additionally  selling  service and administrative expenses for fiscal included million in legal and professional fees related to the audit committee investigation and securities litigation compared to million for such fees in fiscal exclusive of the impact of these special charges as detailed above  selling  service and administration expenses decreased by million  primarily due to reduced legal fees resulting from the settlement of certain patent litigation matters early in the fiscal year 
research  development and engineering expenses in thousands research  development and engineering included in totals above restructuring and cost management plans impact of special charges expenses associated with research  development and engineering totaled million of net sales for fiscal  representing a million increase from expenses of million of net sales for fiscal the increase in research and development is primarily attributable to costs related to our increased investment in funding for development projects  new technical capabilities and initiatives  including an increase in compensation costs due to a higher average headcount in fiscal compared to fiscal  an increase in patent registration and maintenance fees and an increase in subcontracted services and materials used in research and development activities 
we will continue to emphasize research and development investments in the coming year in order to drive product innovation and new product offerings 
we estimate total operating expenses for selling  service and administrative and research  development and engineering activities will be approximately million to million in the first quarter of fiscal patent infringement settlement and related legal fees on october   we entered into a settlement and license agreement pertaining to alleged infringement of surface mount placement equipment related patents 
under the settlement agreement  we were granted a license to the patent in dispute 
as a result of the settlement  we recorded a charge to operations of million in fiscal  consisting of million related to the settlement payment along with approximately million in related legal fees 
restructuring and cost management plans in response to the economic climate and resulting cyclical fluctuations in demand for our products  we initiated restructuring and other cost management plans in fiscal and the preceding fiscal years 
cumulative charges related to restructuring and other cost management plans recorded in fiscal years  and are as follows in thousands cost of goods sold selling  service and administration research  development and engineering total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal year restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal  we initiated a restructuring plan designed to streamline our technology development efforts and enhance our customer centric focus through several actions  including centralizing our research  development and engineering function  creating a technical marketing solutions group and creating a customer centric manufacturing organization 
in conjunction with the restructuring  positions were eliminated in our us operations  impacting all employee groups 
ongoing annual savings will be offset by increased research and development spending in fiscal we started fiscal with employees and ended the year with employees  representing a net decrease of employees during fiscal the restructuring actions were completed in early january and we incurred and paid approximately million in charges related to the fiscal restructuring plan during the third quarter of fiscal these amounts are included in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal as follows in thousands cost of goods sold selling  service and administration research  development and engineering total for the year ended may  severance and other employee related charges fiscal year cost management plan in the first quarter of fiscal we initiated a reduction of employees  impacting all employee groups  in order to reduce expenditures 
charges related to the fiscal plan of approximately million were comprised of severance and other employee related charges 
the headcount reductions primarily occurred in the first quarter and were substantially completed by the second quarter of fiscal as a result  the expense savings realized from those actions were included in the expenditure rate for most of fiscal  but were partially offset by headcount additions in the latter part of the year as we increased our ability to meet increasing product demand

our investment income in the coming year will depend on our ability to generate and invest cash and obtain favorable returns on our investment assets 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease of million is primarily due to the redemption of the convertible notes in march as a result of the redemption of the convertible notes  we recorded charges totaling million  comprised of a redemption premium of million and a non cash charge of million for unamortized debt issuance costs 
interest expense savings as a result of the redemption are expected to be million in fiscal and million in fiscal based on the original maturity date of december on the million principal amount of the convertible notes 
income taxes the income tax provision recorded for fiscal year was million on pretax income of million  an effective rate of 
an income tax benefit of million was recorded for fiscal on pretax income of million as a result of export tax incentives and research and foreign tax credits 
in october the internal revenue service irs began an audit of the fiscal tax years ending in through during fiscal we reached an agreement with the irs on the tax return years under review 
the examination required a special report to be submitted by the irs for congressional approval from the joint committee on taxation 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  we received notice from the irs that the joint committee s review was completed without exception 
as a result  we will receive approximately million in tax refunds 
additionally  we are subject to numerous ongoing state and foreign tax audits 
although the final outcome of these audits is uncertain  based on currently available information we believe the ultimate resolutions will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

this trend began in the second quarter and continued through the remainder of fiscal the increase in sg revenues was also driven by new products introduced in the model line that received rapid acceptance with customers 
the significant increase in sg sales was complimented by stronger sales in our other markets  the pcg market saw end user demand improve in the latter half of fiscal for products that require the use of mlccs processed by our systems 
eig sales levels increased compared to the prior year driven by sales to manufacturers of flex circuits and ic packages that require the use of uv laser drills to produce highly precise manufacturing results 
gross profit in thousands gross profit included in totals above restructuring and cost management plans impact of special charges gross profit was million of net sales for fiscal compared to million of net sales for fiscal shipments in fiscal increased compared to fiscal gross margin improvements over fiscal were due to these higher shipment levels  lower material costs as well as more favorable product sales mix 
in particular  the semiconductor group introduced multiple new systems to the market from the product line 
these higher margin products gained acceptance with customers rapidly  thus contributing to the gross margin improvement in fiscal the increase in shipments also allowed for volume based manufacturing efficiencies which resulted in lower costs per unit during the year 
quarterly shipment volumes steadily increased throughout fiscal  driving increases in gross margin each quarter  from in the first quarter of fiscal to in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we realized a benefit to gross profit of million of net sales resulting from sales of previously reserved inventory 
the increase in fiscal gross profit compared to fiscal was also due to the significant negative impact to fiscal gross profit of charges related to the cost management plans discussed below 
charges related to cost management plans recorded in cost of sales for fiscal and fiscal totaled million and million  respectively 
the fiscal charges were for employee severance payments related to the headcount reductions at the beginning of fiscal cost of sales in fiscal included million in inventory write downs  million in employee severance  relocation and related costs and million in facilities consolidation costs for the closure of our escondido  california facility 
additionally  downward revisions to previously projected product demand resulted in inventory and asset write offs of million and million in charges related to open purchase order commitments in fiscal operating expenses selling  service and administrative expenses in thousands selling  service and administration included in totals above legal and professional fees investigation and securities litigation restructuring and cost management plans impact of special charges selling  service and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to million of net sales in fiscal the primary items included in selling  service and administrative expenses are labor and other employee related expenses  travel expenses  professional fees and facilities costs 
included in selling  service and administrative expenses for fiscal are charges related to cost management plans of million  consisting of employee severance  relocation and related costs of million and facilities consolidation costs of million 
fiscal expenses of million included million in expenses related to cost management plans  comprised of million in employee severance  relocation and related costs  million in facilities consolidation costs and fixed asset write downs of million 
selling  service and administrative expenses also decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as the result of reduced employee expenses related to our cost management plans implemented during fiscal and the decrease in selling  service and administrative expenses was partially offset by legal and professional fees related to the audit committee investigation and securities litigation which increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal research  development and engineering expenses in thousands research  development and engineering included in totals above restructuring and cost management plans impact of special charges research  development and engineering expenses are primarily comprised of labor and other employee related expenses  professional fees  project materials  equipment and facilities costs 
expenses associated with research  development and engineering totaled million for fiscal  representing a million decrease from expenses of million for fiscal included in research and development expenses for fiscal is million in severance and other employee related expenses resulting from our fiscal cost management plan implemented during the first quarter of fiscal for fiscal  these expenses included million in severance and other employee related expenses and million in facilities consolidation costs for a total of million related to cost management plans 
excluding these charges  the overall decrease in research and development spending was million during fiscal and can be attributed to overall headcount reductions as well as decreases in project spending 
research and development spending often fluctuates from year to year as engineering projects move through their product development life cycles 
settlement of class action and derivative lawsuits in fiscal we recorded a charge of million for the settlement of the class action and derivative lawsuits arising from the restatement of earnings announced in fiscal the settlement required a payment of million  of which approximately million was paid by us and approximately million was paid by our insurance carrier 
long lived asset impairment operating expenses in fiscal decreased by million from the prior year as a result of the asset impairment charge recorded in fiscal which included million related to the write down of our klamath falls  oregon components manufacturing site and related equipment  and million related to the write down of land in taiwan 
the market for consumable products manufactured by our klamath falls operation experienced a significant reduction in demand in fiscal as well as significantly increased competition from foreign manufacturers 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the book value of these assets exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flow 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we wrote down the assets to their estimated fair values 
based on our annual review of long lived assets  no impairment charges were required in fiscal other income expense interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates earned during fiscal compared to fiscal on a slightly lower average amount of invested assets  which consist primarily of mortgage backed debt securities and corporate debt securities 
in addition to slightly lower average investment balances  and consistent with market conditions  our investment rates of return steadily declined on all assets in our portfolio during fiscal year interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal annual interest expense related to the convertible notes of approximately million includes million for the accretion of underwriting discounts 
net other expense of million for fiscal increased million when compared with million in other net income in fiscal for fiscal  other net expense of million is primarily comprised of bank fees 
net other income of million in fiscal is primarily comprised of million of bank charges  offset by a gain of million related to legal settlements  a gain on sale of securities of million and a million gain related to the repurchase of million principal amount of the convertible notes 
income taxes the income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year was million on pretax income of million 
the tax benefit in fiscal resulted primarily from export tax incentives of approximately million and million in research and foreign tax credits  respectively  for current and prior periods resulting from tax returns filed in the current year 
to a lesser extent  the net tax benefit was also impacted by the effect of foreign income taxed at rates lower than us federal statutory income tax rates  and the recording of temporary differences previously not recognized 
the income tax benefit recorded for fiscal of million resulted in an effective benefit rate of 
net income loss as a result of the factors discussed above  net income was million  or per basic and diluted share  for fiscal compared to a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  for fiscal financial condition and liquidity at may   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and accounts receivable of million 
at may   we had a current ratio of and no long term debt 
we redeemed our convertible notes on march  as a result  working capital decreased to million at may  from million at may  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are adequate to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows from operating activities totaled million in fiscal cash totaling million was provided by net income adjusted for non cash items 
other factors impacting cash flows from operations included increases in inventories and other assets  decreases in trade receivables and decreases in payables and current liabilities 
net inventories increased to million at may  compared to million at may  the increase is comprised primarily of a million addition to raw materials and purchased parts due to increased spare parts inventories maintained at field service locations in order to service our larger base of installed systems 
the increase in raw materials was offset by a net decrease of million in combined finished goods and work in process inventories due to a tightening of production schedules 
the change in inventory balances also includes a non cash transfer of million to property  plant and equipment and other non current assets for capitalized demonstration and research systems 
net trade receivables were million at may  compared to million at may   a decrease of million 
net trade receivables at may  includes an increase of million due to non cash currency translation adjustments resulting from the weakening of the us dollar 
the remaining decrease is due to lower revenue levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal combined with strong collection activities 
payables and current liabilities were million at may  compared to million at may   a decrease of million 
approximately million of the decrease was due to a reduction in purchases in the latter half of fiscal in response to a softening of demand for our products 
the remaining decrease in other liabilities is due primarily to the payment of accrued amounts for legal settlements and related fees  reductions in estimated income taxes payable  elimination of accrued interest due to the redemption of the convertible notes  decreased payroll liabilities and various other reductions in operating accruals 
cash flows from investing activities totaled million for the fiscal capital expenditures totaled million during this period and were comprised of computer equipment and systems upgrades  and investments in production and test equipment and facilities  including major refurbishment of a research and development clean room and laboratories 
we generated million in cash in june from the sale of an undeveloped parcel of land in taiwan classified as an asset held for sale at may  we also generated a net million in cash and cash equivalents through the liquidation  maturity and sale of restricted investments in our portfolio of marketable securities offset by certain reinvestments 
these investment transactions were undertaken primarily to fund the redemption of the convertible notes on march  and regularly scheduled semi annual interest payments on the convertible notes prior to redemption 
we anticipate capital expenditures related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in fiscal will total approximately million 
cash used in financing activities of million was comprised of the million principal value of convertible notes redeemed on march  discussed below and million in proceeds from our stock plans during fiscal on march   we redeemed the million aggregate principal value of our convertible notes due december  in accordance with the terms of the convertible note indenture  the redemption price was of the principal amount of the convertible notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
in connection with the redemption  we recorded expenses of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  consisting of the redemption premium  a non cash charge for unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately million and other related costs 
a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of may  is as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years more than years purchase commitments derivative financial instruments  net operating leases derivative financial instruments represent various forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions 
amounts are presented above in us dollars  translated at the exchange rate on may  and are a net presentation of amounts expected to be received and paid upon settlement of these contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
refer to part ii  item note summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  inventory write downs  product warranty reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  income tax benefits  expenses  deferred taxes and valuation allowances  loss contingencies  and long lived asset valuations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally pass to the customer at the time of delivery of the product to a common carrier 
revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that fulfillment of acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
where the acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  or in the case of substantially new products  revenue is deferred until acceptance has been received 
for multiple element arrangements  the fair values of any undelivered elements  estimated based on the list price of such elements  are deferred until the elements are delivered and acceptance criteria are met 
installation services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered equipment 
beginning in fiscal  and in accordance with sab  installation revenue is deferred until installation is complete 
prior to fiscal  and in accordance with sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  the costs of installation service were accrued at the time the revenue was recorded 
historically  neither the costs of installation accrued nor the fair value of installation service revenue deferred has been significant 
revenues associated with sales to customers under local contracts in japan are recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurs upon customer acceptance  with the exception of sales to our distributor in japan  where revenues are recognized upon title transfer to the distributor 
we have no distributor relationships outside of japan 
revenues related to spare parts and consumable sales are recognized upon shipment 
revenues related to maintenance and service contracts are recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
revenues are difficult to predict  due in part to our reliance on customer acceptance for a portion of our revenues 
any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
inventory write downs we regularly evaluate the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to  the following forecasted sales or usage  historical usage rates  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative uses for the inventory are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
raw materials with quantities in excess of forecasted usage are reviewed quarterly for obsolescence by our engineering and operating personnel 
raw material obsolescence write downs are typically caused by engineering change orders or product end of life adjustments in the market 
finished goods are reviewed quarterly by product marketing and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices 
we record inventory write downs  when necessary  as an increase to cost of sales based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities and demand into our analysis 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change 
product warranty reserves we evaluate obligations related to product warranties quarterly 
a standard one year warranty is provided on products 
warranty charges are comprised of costs to service the warranty  including labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items  as well as other costs incidental to the repairs 
inventory credits resulting from the return of repaired parts to inventory and any cost recoveries from warranties offered by our suppliers for defective components are recorded as a credit to the warranty accrual 
using historical data  we estimate average warranty cost per system or part type and record the provision for such charges as an element of cost of goods sold 
additionally  the overall warranty accrual balance is separately analyzed using the remaining warranty periods outstanding on systems and items under warranty  and any resulting changes in estimates are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales upon shipment 
if circumstances change  or if a material change in warranty related incidents occurs  the estimate of the warranty accrual could change significantly 
accrued product warranty is included on the balance sheet as a component of accrued liabilities 
our warranty expense in fiscal totaled million 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established by reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to initiate and modify their credit limits 
on certain foreign sales  we require letters of credit 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account becomes past due  we talk with the customer to determine the cause 
if we determine that the customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information then available 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
we record estimated bad debts quarterly as an increase to selling  service and administrative expenses 
at may   our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and our bad debt expense in fiscal was million 
deferred taxes and tax reserves deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled 
under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be fully realized  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
should management s assumptions and expectations be inaccurate  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in future periods 
at may   our net deferred tax assets totaled million  which included a valuation allowance of million 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions and in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we have reserves for taxes to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be challenged by taxing authorities  even though the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are appropriate 
tax reserves are reviewed as warranted and adjusted as events occur that affect the company s potential liability for additional taxes 
loss contingencies where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation  we record a liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
because of uncertainties relating to litigation  however  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
moreover  plaintiffs may not specify an amount of damages sought 
long lived asset valuations long lived assets  principally property and equipment and identifiable intangibles held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
we evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
factors that may affect future results the statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact  including without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects and similar words  constitute forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
from time to time we may make other forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned that such forward looking statements are subject to an inherent risk that actual results may materially differ 
the following information highlights some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
factors that may result in such variances include  but are not limited to the following the industries that comprise our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable 
our business depends upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of components and circuitry used in wireless communications  computers and other electronic products 
in the past  the markets for electronic devices have experienced sharp downturns 
during these downturns  electronics manufacturers  including our customers  have delayed or canceled capital expenditures  which has had a negative impact on our financial results 
after experiencing a significant increase in orders in fiscal  we experienced reduced demand beginning in the first quarter of fiscal net sales decreased from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal to million  million  million and million in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
net income loss during those periods decreased from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal to million  million  million and million in the first  second third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
we cannot assure you when  or if  demand for our products will increase or that demand will not further decrease 
even if demand for our products does increase  there may be significant fluctuations in our profitability and net sales 
during any downturn  including the current downturn  it will be difficult for us to maintain our sales levels 
as a consequence  to maintain profitability we will need to reduce our operating expenses 
for example  in december we announced an operational restructuring and reduction in force to reduce our expenses in connection with the current downturn 
our ability to quickly reduce operating expenses is dependent upon the nature of the actions we take to reduce expense and our subsequent ability to implement those actions and realize expected cost savings 
additionally  we may be unable to defer capital expenditures and we will need to continue to invest in certain areas such as research and development 
an economic downturn may also cause us to incur charges related to impairment of assets and inventory write offs and we may also experience delays in payments from our customers  which would have a negative effect on our financial results 
delays in manufacturing  shipment or customer acceptance of our products could substantially decrease our sales for a period 
we depend on manufacturing flexibility to meet the changing demands of our customers 
any significant delay or interruption in receiving raw materials or in our manufacturing operations as a result of software deficiencies  natural disasters  or other causes could result in reduced manufacturing capabilities or delayed product deliveries  any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of a relatively small number of products 
consequently  shipment and or customer acceptance delays could significantly impact our recognition of revenue and could be further magnified by announcements from us or our competitors of new products and technologies  which announcements could cause our customers to defer purchases of our systems or purchase products from our competitors 
any of these delays could result in a material adverse change in our results of operations for any particular period 
failure of critical suppliers of parts  components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to us in a timely and cost effective manner could negatively affect our business 
we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products  including custom electronic and mechanical components  and we use numerous suppliers for those materials 
we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
we seek to reduce the risk of production and service interruptions and shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts  monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers  some key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers in the short term 
operations at our suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including changes in business relationships  competitive factors  work stoppages  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
such disruption could interrupt our manufacturing 
our business may be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
we depend on a few significant customers and we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
our top ten customers for fiscal accounted for approximately of total net sales in fiscal  with one customer  samsung  accounting for approximately  and of total net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
no other customer in fiscal  fiscal or fiscal accounted for more than of total net sales 
in addition  none of our customers has any long term obligation to continue to buy our products or services  and any customer could delay  reduce or cease ordering our products or services at any time 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  and to compete effectively we must continually introduce new products that achieve market acceptance 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and innovation  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our future performance will depend on the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address technological changes as well as current and potential customer requirements 
the introduction by us or by our competitors of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for our existing products  which may harm our operating results 
we have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing a slowdown in demand for our products 
in the past we have also experienced delays in new product development 
similar slowdowns and delays may occur in the future 
we also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements or  where necessary  to license these technologies from others 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including changing product specifications and customer requirements  difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel  difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  difficulties with contract manufacturers  changing market or competitive product requirements  and unanticipated engineering complexities 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  if at all  or on a timely basis 
further  we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes or emerging industry standards 
any failure to respond to technological change that may render our current products or technologies obsolete could significantly harm our business 
our ability to reduce costs is limited by our need to invest in research and development 
our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
because of intense competition in the industries in which we compete  if we were to fail to invest sufficiently in research and development  our products could become less attractive to potential customers  and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of our need to maintain our spending levels in this area  our operating results could be materially harmed if our net sales fall below expectations 
in addition  as a result of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation  our operating costs may increase further in the future  and research and development expenses may increase as a percentage of total operating expenses and as a percentage of net sales 
we are exposed to the risks that others may violate our proprietary rights  and our intellectual property rights may not be well protected in foreign countries 
our success is dependent upon the protection of our proprietary rights 
in the high technology industry  intellectual property is an important asset that is always at risk of infringement 
we incur substantial costs to obtain and maintain patents and defend our intellectual property 
for example  we have initiated litigation alleging that certain parties have violated various patents of ours 
we rely upon the laws of the united states and of foreign countries in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these proprietary rights may not provide the competitive advantages that we expect or other parties may challenge  invalidate or circumvent these rights 
further  our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the united states 
many us companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in foreign countries 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries  it could be easier for our competitors to sell competing products in foreign countries  which could result in reduced sales 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement 
several of our competitors hold patents covering a variety of technologies  applications and methods of use similar to some of those used in our products 
from time to time  we and our customers have received correspondence from our competitors claiming that some of our products  as used by our customers  may be infringing one or more of these patents 
competitors or others have in the past and may in the future assert infringement claims against our customers or us with respect to current or future products or uses  and these assertions may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to use intellectual property rights of others 
if claims of infringement are asserted against our customers  those customers may seek indemnification from us for damages or expenses they incur 
if we become subject to infringement claims  we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives  which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question or defending our position 
these licenses  however  may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all 
if we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our business is highly competitive  and if we fail to compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
we face substantial competition from established competitors  some of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products 
new companies may enter the markets in which we compete  or industry consolidation may occur  further increasing competition in those markets 
furthermore  our technological advantages may be reduced or lost as a result of technological advances by our competitors 
our competitors greater resources in the areas described above may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns  compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology  and more quickly develop enhancements to and new generations of products 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including performance of our products  quality of our products  reliability of our products  cost of using our products  consistent availability of critical components  our ability to ship products on the schedule required  quality of the technical service we provide  timeliness of the services we provide  our success in developing new products and enhancements  existing market and economic conditions  and price of our products as compared to our competitors products 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future  and increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share 
the loss of key management or our inability to attract  retain and assimilate sufficient numbers of managerial  financial  engineering and other technical personnel could have a material effect upon our results of operations 
our continued success depends  in part  upon key managerial  financial  engineering and technical personnel as well as our ability to continue to attract  retain and assimilate additional personnel 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we may not be able to retain our key managerial  financial  engineering and technical employees 
attracting qualified personnel is difficult  and our efforts to attract and retain these personnel may not be successful 
in addition  we may not be able to assimilate qualified personnel  including any new members of senior management  which could disrupt our operations 
our worldwide direct sales and service operations expose us to employer related risks in foreign countries 
we have established direct sales and service organizations throughout the world 
a worldwide direct sales and service model in foreign countries involves certain risks 
we are subject to compliance with the labor laws and other laws governing employers in the countries where our operations are located and as a result we may incur additional costs to comply with these local regulations 
additionally  we may encounter labor shortages or disputes that could inhibit our ability to effectively sell  market and service our products 
if we cannot effectively manage the risks related to employing persons in foreign countries  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we may make additional acquisitions in the future  and these acquisitions may subject us to risks associated with integrating these businesses into our current business 
although we have no commitments or agreements for any acquisitions  in the future we may make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses with complementary products  services or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control  including difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies  lack of synergy  or inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  and acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance by the acquired company 
our inability to effectively manage these acquisition risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by our existing shareholders could be diluted 
if we use cash to pay for an acquisition the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or to use for other purposes 
in addition  the accounting for future acquisitions could result in significant charges resulting from amortization of intangible assets related to such acquisitions 
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business  including risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations  legal and regulatory changes and the impact of regional and global economic disruptions 
international shipments accounted for of net sales in fiscal  with of our net sales to customers in asia 
we expect that international shipments will continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales in the future 
our non us sales  purchases and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including the following periodic local or geographic economic downturns and unstable political conditions  price and currency exchange controls  fluctuation in the relative values of currencies  difficulties protecting intellectual property  local labor disputes  shipping delays and disruptions  unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  and difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable  managing distributors and representatives and repatriation of earnings 
our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of the possibility of regional or global economic disruptions including those resulting from natural disasters  the economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities and associated political instability  and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic and international travel and commerce 
in particular  due to these uncertainties we are subject to the risk that future tightening of immigration controls may adversely affect the residence status of non us engineers and other key technical employees in our us facilities or our ability to hire new non us employees in such facilities  the risk of more frequent instances of shipping delays  and the risk that demand for our products may not increase or may decrease 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and stock price 
we have documented and tested our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
our ability to maintain internal controls may be negatively impacted by our planned implementation of new enterprise management software and systems 
moreover  effective internal controls  particularly those related to revenue recognition  are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to prevent financial fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly 
enterprise resource planning system erp implementation could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we are highly dependent on our systems infrastructure in order to process orders  track inventory  ship products in a timely manner  prepare invoices to our customers and otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course 
key to the success of our strategy to drive greater productivity and cost savings is the implementation of a new worldwide erp system expected in fiscal if we experience problems with the implementation of this system  the resulting disruption could adversely affect our business  sales  results of operations and financial condition 
the transition to our new erp system involves numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the system with our current operations  diversion of management s attention away from normal daily operations of our business  initial dependence on an unfamiliar system while training personnel in its use  increased demand on our support operations  and potential delay in the processing of customer orders for shipment of products 
further  we may experience difficulties in the transition to the new software that could affect our internal control systems  processes  procedures and related documentation 
the erp implementation will require significant effort in a compressed timeframe  as well as result in our incurring costs to comply with sarbanes oxley section by documenting all business processes that have been revised as a result of the implementation 
this will result in compliance costs that will be in addition to the implementation costs of our new system 
there can be no assurances that the evaluation required by sarbanes oxley section for fiscal will not result in the identification of significant control deficiencies or that our auditors will be able to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the implementation of the new erp system 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of may   our investment portfolio includes marketable debt securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase
