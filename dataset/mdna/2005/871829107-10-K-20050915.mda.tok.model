item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations highlights sales increased in fiscal over fiscal fiscal included weeks  as compared to fiscal which included an additional rd week 
after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal  sales increased in fiscal over fiscal adjusted sales see the reconciliation of fiscal actual sales to fiscal adjusted sales in sales under results of operations 
gross margins as a percent of sales for fiscal decreased from the prior year due to the impact of product cost increases and changes in customer mix and segment mix 
operating expenses as a percent of sales for fiscal decreased from the prior year due to operating efficiencies  operating costs increasing at lower rates than sales price increases  reduced performance based management incentive compensation and decreased net pension costs  which overcame increased fuel costs and increased expenses incurred on the national supply chain project 
the income tax provision in fiscal includes a tax benefit of million primarily related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on certain state net operating loss carryforwards and a tax benefit of million related to the reversal of a tax contingency accrual 
the comparison of fiscal s net earnings to fiscal was also negatively impacted by the additional rd week in fiscal primarily as a result of these factors  net earnings for fiscal increased over the prior year 
management believes that prolonged periods of rising product costs  together with general economic conditions  including the impact of increased fuel costs on consumer spending  contributed to a softness in the foodservice market and thus a slowing of sysco s sales growth beginning in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing into the first half of fiscal after adjusting for the additional week in last year s fourth quarter  sales growth remained relatively stable over the course of fiscal management believes that the declining rate of product cost increases over the course of fiscal has lessened the overall gross margin pressures experienced during the year and has contributed to the underlying unit growth experienced in the latter half of fiscal additionally  management believes that the maturation of the company s business review process has contributed to unit sales growth 
the company continues to focus on customer account penetration and expense controls  including managing personnel expenses  improving productivity and ongoing benchmarking and sharing of best practices at the operating companies 
overview sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants  healthcare and educational facilities  lodging establishments and other foodservice customers 
sysco s operations are located throughout the united states and canada and include broadline companies  specialty produce companies  custom cut meat operations  asian cuisine foodservice operations  hotel supply operations  and sygma  the company s chain restaurant distribution subsidiary 
the company estimates that it serves about of an approximately billion annual market that includes the north american foodservice and hotel amenity  furniture and textile markets 
according to industry sources  the foodservice  or food prepared away from home  market represents approximately one half of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level 
this share grew from about in to its current level in general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home and in turn can impact sysco s sales 
sysco historically has grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and has grown its market share in this fragmented industry 
the company intends to continue to expand its market share and grow earnings through strategies which include sales growth the company plans to grow sales by gaining an increased share of products purchased by existing customers  development of new customers  the use of foldouts new operating companies created in established markets previously served by other sysco operating companies and a disciplined acquisition program 
the company uses market information to estimate the potential sales and profitability of new and existing customers 
marketing resources  sysco brand products and value added services provided by sysco can be custom tailored to the purchasing needs of customers 
additionally  the investment of resources in any particular account can be made in proportion to the account s potential profitability 
brand management sysco brand products are manufactured by suppliers to meet sysco s product specifications using strict quality assurance standards 
sysco believes that sysco brand products generally provide higher profitability than national brand products to sysco 
sysco believes that sysco brand products also provide a greater value to sysco s customers and differentiate sysco from its customers 

table of contents productivity gains the company s investment in warehousing and transportation technology and the implementation of best business practices allows sysco to leverage operating expenses relative to sales growth 
sales force effectiveness the company invests in the development and expansion of its customer contact resources by hiring additional customer contact personnel through targeted recruiting  hiring and promotion practices  effective use of training programs and improved compensation systems 
expanded business review and business development functions allow the sales force to strengthen customer relationships and increase sales 
supply chain management the company s national supply chain project and related organization is being developed to reduce total supply chain costs  operating costs and working capital requirements of the company 
the company s national supply chain project is intended to optimize the supply chain activities for products for sysco s operating companies in each respective region and as a result  increase profitability and lower inventory and operating costs  working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at sysco s operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 
the company expects to build from seven to nine regional distribution centers in the united states over the next seven years 
the first of these centers  the northeast redistribution center located in front royal  virginia  opened during the third quarter of fiscal as of august  it was supplying products to of the broadline operating companies in the northeast region and is expected to be shipping products to the remaining two operating companies in the northeast region by october the company expects to begin construction of its second regional redistribution facility  to be located in alachua  florida  in fiscal the expenses related to the national supply chain project in the first quarter of fiscal are expected to be approximately equal to expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal or about million 
during the first half of fiscal  the ramp up phase of the northeast redistribution center will be completed 
it is anticipated that the majority of benefits that will be realized in fiscal from the northeast redistribution center will be realized during the second half of fiscal as this is when the northeast redistribution center is expected to be operating at full volume 
hurricane katrina hurricane katrina principally impacted our operating companies in jackson  mississippi and new orleans  louisiana as well as causing many of our customers in the new orleans and mississippi gulf coast area to be closed 
the impacted operations in jackson have recovered and service to customers has been restored 
sysco s facility in new orleans sustained only minor damage from the storm but remained closed after the storm due to conditions in new orleans 
the facility has recently resumed partial operations  however  most of the orders received from customers of the new orleans facility that are open for business have been temporarily rerouted to other nearby sysco facilities for fulfillment and delivery until the new orleans facility has been restored to full capacity 
we are still assessing the impact of hurricane katrina on our operations in the areas affected by the storm  however  we do not expect this occurrence to have a material adverse effect on sysco s financial position or fiscal s operating results as a whole 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the components of the results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated sales costs and expenses cost of sales operating expenses interest expense other  net total costs and expenses earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings the following table sets forth the change in the components of the results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year sales costs and expenses cost of sales operating expenses interest expense other  net total costs and expenses earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share average shares outstanding diluted shares outstanding sales sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal  or greater after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal  or greater after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal because the fourth quarter of fiscal contained an additional week as compared to fiscal and fiscal  sales growth for fiscal years  and are not directly comparable 
in order to provide a more comparable picture of sales growth  management believes that it is appropriate to adjust the sales figures for fiscal by the estimated impact of the additional week 
as a result  sales for fiscal presented in the table below are adjusted by one fourteenth of total sales for the fourth quarter 
set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth to adjusted sales growth for the periods presented weeks weeks weeks sales for the fiscal year estimated sales for the additional week adjusted sales actual percentage increase adjusted percentage increase acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal and for fiscal sysco generally expects to pass product cost increases to its customers  however  the actual amount of inflation reflected as sales price increases is difficult to quantify 
estimated product cost increases were during fiscal as compared to during fiscal management believes that prolonged periods of rising product costs together with general economic conditions  including the impact of increased fuel costs on consumer spending  contributed to the softness in the foodservice market and thus a slowing of sysco s sales growth beginning in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing into the first half of fiscal 
table of contents after adjusting for the additional week in last year s fourth quarter  sales growth remained relatively stable over the course of fiscal management believes that the declining rate of product cost increases over the course of fiscal has lessened the overall gross margin pressures experienced during the year and has contributed to the underlying unit growth in the latter half of fiscal additionally  management believes that the maturation of the company s business review process has contributed to unit sales growth 
the company also continues its focus on profitable sales growth 
one part of this strategy involves being more selective with respect to which customers we serve  including improving the profitability of  or ultimately exiting  unprofitable customers and refining the use of customer purchasing potential and profitability data in targeting new customers 
the company continues to see reductions in sales to unprofitable customers over the comparable prior year periods 
in addition  the number of customer contact personnel increased almost in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the number at the end of the third quarter of fiscal the company intends to continue to increase the number of customer contact associates in fiscal industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of approximately in calendar year and real sales decline of approximately in calendar year a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below fresh and frozen meats canned and dry products frozen fruits  vegetables  bakery and other poultry dairy products fresh produce paper and disposables seafood beverage products equipment and smallwares janitorial products medical supplies a comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below restaurants hospitals and nursing homes schools and colleges hotels and motels all other gross margins gross margins as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal when compared to the prior year 
management believes that this gross margin decline was caused by several factors  including product cost increases  changes in segment mix  customer mix and pricing pressure 
product cost increases in most of the product categories had the impact of reducing gross margins as a percentage of sales  as gross profit dollars are earned on a higher sales dollar base 
the decline in gross margins as a percent of sales slowed during the course of fiscal due in part to a lessening of the rate of product cost increases during the fiscal year 
gross margins as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal when compared to the prior year 
management believes that gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal were impacted by several factors  including product cost increases  changes in customer mix  segment mix and product mix and pricing pressure 
operating expenses operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling  administrative and occupancy expenses 
changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several factors  including improved efficiencies  customer mix  and product cost increases which result in increases in sales prices 
the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was aided by improved operating efficiencies 
for example  the broadline segment continues to demonstrate improving trends in key expense metrics  including miles driven per trip  pieces per stop and pieces per error 
increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating costs increased at a lower rate 

table of contents operating expenses were negatively impacted by increased costs to deliver product to customers due to increased fuel costs of approximately  in fiscal over the prior year 
operating expenses related to the national supply chain project were  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal also included in operating expenses was the recognition of a gain of  in fiscal to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value  as compared to a gain of  in fiscal operating expenses were favorably impacted by a reduction of management performance based incentive bonuses of  and a decrease in net pension cost of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable to several factors including improved operating efficiencies as demonstrated by improving trends in key expense metrics tracked at the broadline operating companies  including pieces sold per delivery  product line items sold per delivery  pieces per trip and pieces per error 
increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating costs increased at a lower rate 
operating expenses were negatively impacted by increases in net pension costs of  and by increases in expenses related to the national supply chain project of  over fiscal also included in operating expenses was the recognition of a gain of  in fiscal to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value  as compared to a loss of  in fiscal in order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs  sysco from time to time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of sysco s projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of july  were not material 
interest expense the increase in interest expense in fiscal was due to increased borrowing interest rates 
the increase in the company s overall borrowing interest rates was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of the company s debt with fixed interest rates in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  the company s debt portfolio included a larger percentage of floating rate debt in the form of either commercial paper issuances or fixed rate debt converted to floating through interest rate swap agreements 
in addition  market interest rates have increased during fiscal the decrease in interest expense in fiscal was primarily due to lower borrowing interest rates offsetting moderately higher borrowing levels 
the lower average borrowing rates of the company in fiscal were due to lower short term market interest rates and the use of interest rate swaps which converted the fixed rates of interest on a portion of sysco s long term debt to lower variable rates of interest 
other  net changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities  primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities 
income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the income tax provision in fiscal includes a tax benefit of  primarily related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on certain state net operating loss carryforwards and a tax benefit of  related to the reversal of a tax contingency accrual 
net earnings fiscal represents the twenty ninth consecutive year of increased earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting changes 
the increases were due to the factors discussed above 
in addition  the comparison of fiscal s net earnings to fiscal was negatively impacted by the additional rd week in fiscal earnings per share the increases in earnings per share were the result of factors discussed above  as well as a net reduction of shares outstanding due primarily to share repurchases 
return on average shareholders equity the return on average shareholders equity was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the higher return in fiscal was primarily due to the impact of minimum pension liability adjustments to shareholders equity 
since its inception  sysco has averaged approximately return on average shareholders equity

the comparison of fiscal sales to fiscal is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal the fiscal sales growth was due to increased sales to marketing associate served customers and multi unit customers  including increased sales of sysco brand products  and price increases resulting from higher product costs 
the additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal the sales growth in fiscal and was obtained through increased sales to the existing customer base as well as the acquisition of new customers 
the decrease of broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales in fiscal was due primarily to strong sales growth in the sygma and other segments outpacing the broadline sales growth  as well as the contributions to sales growth from the acquisitions of specialty produce and sygma operations during fiscal and fiscal the decrease of broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales in fiscal was due primarily to strong sales growth in the sygma and other segments outpacing the broadline sales growth  as well as the contribution to sales growth from the acquisition of the asian cuisine foodservice operations during fiscal marketing associate served sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal sysco brand sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us decreased to for fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal was primarily due to increases in sales and increased operating efficiencies aided by lower expenses as a percentage of sales 
factors contributing to the lower expenses as a percentage of sales were reduced performance based management incentive compensation and decreased net periodic pension costs  which overcame higher fuel costs and increased expenditures related to the national supply chain project 
the comparison of fiscal s earnings before income taxes to fiscal was also negatively impacted by the additional rd week in fiscal the increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal year was primarily due to increased sales and reduced expenses as a percentage of sales  which more than offset reduced margins as a percentage of sales 
the additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal 
table of contents sygma segment acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal and in fiscal the comparison of fiscal sales to fiscal is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal both the fiscal and fiscal sales growth was due primarily to sales to new customers  sales growth in sygma s existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers  as well as increases in sales to existing locations  price increases resulting primarily from higher product costs and sales from acquisitions 
the additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal the decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal was due to several factors 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  sygma discontinued servicing a portion of its largest customer s locations due to that customer s geographic supply chain realignment 
sygma offset these lost sales by obtaining sales from additional locations from this customer and obtaining new business from other customers 
in many cases  this new business is being served out of different sygma locations than those that originally served the discontinued business 
sygma opened a new facility to serve a portion of the new business which it began serving in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  during the fourth quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal  sygma s operating profits have been impacted by increased operating expenses as it transitioned its operations to serve the new business it has acquired 
in addition  sygma s gross margins as a percent of sales in fiscal have declined from the comparable period in fiscal due to product cost increases and lower agreed upon pricing with its customers 
the increase in earnings before income taxes in fiscal was primarily due to the increased sales offset by increased expenses incurred related to implementation of new systems  severance payments related to certain personnel changes  costs related to worker s compensation insurance claims and pension costs 
the additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal liquidity and capital resources sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the united states and canada 
the company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth  foldouts and acquisitions 
the company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its customer contact personnel  its consolidated buying programs and the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities 
these objectives require continuing investment 
sysco s resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 
sysco s operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs  cash dividends  and acquisitions compatible with the company s overall growth strategy 
any remaining cash generated from operations may  at the discretion of management  be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program  while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long term debt 
sysco s share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans  for acquisitions  to reduce shares outstanding which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share and to aid in managing the ratio of long term debt to total capitalization 
management targets a long term debt to total capitalization ratio between and 
the ratio may exceed the target range from time to time  due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities  and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases 
the ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases 
this ratio was and at july  and july   respectively 
for purposes of calculating this ratio  long term debt includes both the current maturities and long term portion 
in april  sysco filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement covering  in debt securities 
the registration statement was declared effective in may in june  sysco repaid the senior notes totaling  at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 
in july  sysco also repaid the senior notes totaling  at maturity also utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 
the company intends to issue between  and  of long term debt in september the amount of long term debt that sysco issues will depend upon market conditions at the time of issuance 
the proceeds from such issuance are intended to be utilized to repay outstanding commercial paper issuances and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
also during the fall of  the company intends to renegotiate its revolving bank credit facility which supports the us commercial paper program

also impacting cash flow from operations were decreases in other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the decreases in other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost in each year are primarily due to the amount of pension contributions exceeding the net pension cost recognized in each year 
the company s contributions to its defined benefit plans were   and  during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
included in the amounts contributed in fiscal was  voluntarily contributed to the qualified pension plan in the fourth quarter 
the decision to increase the contributions to the qualified pension plan in fiscal was primarily due to the decreased discount rate  which increased the pension obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal year end pension funded status 
the company expects to contribute approximately  to its defined benefit plans in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  the company began reorganizing its supply chain to maximize consolidated efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of the merchandising and procurement functions performed for the benefit of customers 
the structure results in the deferral of certain federal and state income tax payments  as supply chain distributions are not included in taxable income until distributed in periods subsequent to when they are recognized in book income 
fiscal is the first period that supply chain distributions were included in taxable income since the company began deferring these items for tax purposes in fiscal as a result of the impact of these items and other temporary differences  including the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  excess tax depreciation and pension contributions  taxes paid during fiscal and increased to  and  respectively  as compared to  in fiscal the net cash flow impact of supply chain distribution deferrals in fiscal was incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral  due to increased volume through this structure 
the amount of taxes paid in fiscal was reduced by  as the result of the utilization of a us federal net operating loss carryforward 
this net operating loss carryforward was generated in fiscal primarily as a result of the deferral of supply chain distributions 
also impacting the amount of taxes paid in each year is the amount of deductible pension contributions made in each year 
as indicated above  the company expects that its pension contributions in fiscal will be substantially less than the contributions made in the preceeding three fiscal years

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
senior management has reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related disclosure 
sysco s most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  self insurance programs  pension plans  income taxes  vendor consideration and accounting for business combinations 
allowance for doubtful accounts sysco evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
in addition  allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries 
the company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off  including bankruptcy  accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods 
if the financial condition of sysco s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance program sysco maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation  group medical  general liability and vehicle liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 
pension plans amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
the measurement date for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is fiscal year end for fiscal years and prior 
beginning in fiscal  the measurement date will be may st which represents a change in accounting 
the one month acceleration of the measurement date will allow additional time for management to evaluate and report the actuarial pension measurements in the year end financial statements and disclosures within the accelerated filing deadlines of the securities and exchange commission 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting is expected to result in an increase to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal of approximately  net of tax 
for guidance in determining the discount rate  sysco calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plans 
the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the discount rate assumption utilized impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal increased to from the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal of 
this increase in the discount rate decreased sysco s net pension costs for fiscal by approximately  the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs  which was determined as of the may  measurement date  decreased to 
this decrease will increase sysco s net pension costs for fiscal by approximately  sysco looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels 
sysco used a plan specific age related set of rates equivalent to a single rate of for the qualified pension plan retirement plan  as of july  and july  the supplemental executive retirement plan assumes annual salary increases of through fiscal and thereafter as of july  and july  
table of contents the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was for fiscal and the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns  reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets 
although not determinative of future returns  the effective annual rate of return on plan assets  developed using geometric compound averaging  was approximately   and over the year  year  year and year periods ended december   respectively 
in addition  in nine of the last years  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
a increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal would decrease increase sysco s net pension costs for fiscal by approximately  minimum pension liability adjustments are recorded so that the recorded pension liability is at least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase or decrease in the pension liability and an offsetting charge or benefit to shareholders equity  net of tax  through comprehensive loss or income 
amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to minimum pension liability  were charges  net of tax  of  as of july   and  as of july  changes in the assumptions  including changes to the discount rate discussed above  together with the normal growth of the plan  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions  decreased net pension costs  in fiscal and is expected to increase net pension costs in fiscal by approximately the company made cash contributions to its pension plans of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  including voluntary contributions to the retirement plan of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
included in the amounts contributed in fiscal was  voluntarily contributed to the qualified pension plan in the fourth quarter 
the decision to increase the contributions to the retirement plan in fiscal was primarily due to the decreased discount rate  which increased the pension obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal year end pension funded status 
in fiscal  as in the previous years  contributions to the retirement plan will not be required to meet erisa minimum funding requirements but the company anticipates that it will make voluntary contributions of approximately  which is the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal the estimated fiscal contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp and other post retirement plans together are approximately  income taxes the determination of the company s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
the company s provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state  as well as canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances  and the company s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions  the company establishes an accrual when  despite management s belief that the company s tax return positions are supportable  management believes that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss is probable 
when facts and circumstances change  these accruals are adjusted 
vendor consideration sysco recognizes consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco 
there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors 
in many instances  the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound 
in these instances  sysco will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases  sysco will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete  the related service is performed and the amounts realized 
in certain of these latter instances  the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by sysco 
in these cases  sysco classifies the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognizes these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed 
accounting for business combinations goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  sysco assesses the 
table of contents recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values 
the evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis  as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections  resulting in the company revising its assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
new accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb opinion  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard 
sysco will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal sfas r allows for two transition methods 
the basic difference between the two methods is that the modified prospective transition method does not require restatement of prior periods  whereas the modified retrospective transition method will require restatement 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options or stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan 
although the full impact of the company s adoption of sfas r s fair value method has not yet been determined  the company expects that it will have a significant impact on its results of operations 
the disclosure in the footnotes to the company s consolidated financial statements under stock based compensation of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the company had recognized compensation cost for share based payments under sfas for periods prior to fiscal is not necessarily indicative of the potential impact of recognizing compensation cost for share based payments under sfas r in future periods 
the company estimates that the earnings per share impact to fiscal resulting from recording compensation expense related to stock options and the employees stock purchase plan will be approximately to 
the potential impact of adopting sfas r on fiscal s results of operations and earnings per share is dependent on several factors  including the number of options granted in fiscal  the fair value of those options which will be determined at the date of grant  the level of participation in the employees stock purchase plan  the related income tax benefits recorded and the diluted shares outstanding 
this estimate is based on certain assumptions as to these factors and the actual impact may differ if actual results vary from the assumptions 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
the standard changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a voluntary change in accounting principle requiring a retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of the change in principle unless it is impracticable rather than the recording of a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle in net income in the year of change 
the standard is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  risk factors low margin business  inflation and economic sensitivity the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins 
sysco makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup 
as a result  sysco s profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation  even though sysco s gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 
prolonged periods of product cost inflation also may have a negative impact on the company s profit margins and earnings to the extent such product cost increases are not passed on to customers due to resistance to higher prices 
the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions 
inflation  fuel costs and other factors affecting consumer confidence and the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home may negatively impact sysco s sales and operating results 
sysco s operating results are also sensitive to  and may be adversely affected by  other factors  including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable  competitive price pressures  severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
although these factors have not had a material adverse impact on sysco s past operations  there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results 

table of contents increased fuel costs increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home 
the high cost of fuel can also increase the price paid by sysco for product as well as the costs incurred by sysco to deliver product to its customers 
these factors in turn may negatively impact sysco s sales  margins  operating expenses and operating results 
interruption of supplies and increases in product costs sysco obtains substantially all of its foodservice and related products from third party suppliers 
for the most part  sysco does not have long term contracts with its suppliers committing them to provide products to sysco 
although sysco s purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers  suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by sysco in the quantities and at the prices requested 
because sysco does not control the actual production of the products it sells  it also is subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside its control 
these conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers  weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  increases in fuel costs  competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
sysco s inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise  could mean that sysco could not fulfill its obligations to customers  and customers may turn to other distributors 
leverage and debt service because a substantial part of sysco s growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion  sysco s continued growth depends  in large part  on its ability to continue this expansion 
as a result  its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand 
moreover  any default under the documents governing the indebtedness of sysco could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of sysco s common stock 
further  sysco s leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures 
product liability claims sysco  like any other seller of food  faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness 
with respect to product liability claims  sysco believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance 
however  this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost  or  if available  may not be adequate to cover all of sysco s liabilities 
sysco generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its products  but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited  as a practical matter  to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers 
if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available  product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce sysco s net earnings and earnings per share 
labor relations as of july   approximately  employees at operating companies were members of different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations 
in fiscal  agreements covering approximately  employees will expire 
failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages 
although sysco s operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date  and sysco believes they have satisfactory relationships with their unions  a work stoppage due to failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a union contract  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on sysco 
integration of acquired companies if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic  operational and other benefits in a timely manner  its profitability may decrease 
integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when sysco acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or no expertise  or with a corporate culture different from sysco s 
if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully  it may incur substantial costs and delays in increasing its customer base 
in addition  the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully may divert management s attention from sysco s existing business and may damage sysco s relationships with its key customers and suppliers 
charter and stockholder rights plan under its restated certificate of incorporation  sysco s board of directors is authorized to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco 
table of contents without approval of the board of directors  depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued 
in addition  if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco  the stockholders of sysco have the right to purchase preferred stock of sysco pursuant to its stockholder rights plan  which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquiror 
the existence of either of these provisions could deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to sysco s stockholders 
forward looking statements certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of they include statements about sysco s ability to increase its market share and sales  long term debt to capitalization target ratios  anticipated capital expenditures  timing and expected benefits of the national supply chain project and related regional distribution centers  and sysco s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 
these statements are based on management s current expectations and estimates  actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above 
in addition  sysco s ability to increase its market share and sales  meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses 
the ability to meet long term debt to capitalization target ratios also may be affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
sysco s use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 
sysco manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 
at july   the company had outstanding  of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through july  the company s total long term debt obligations of  were primarily at fixed rates of interest 
the company intends to issue between  and  of long term debt in september the amount of long term debt that sysco issues will depend upon market conditions at the time of issuance 
in march  sysco entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of  as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on  of the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
during fiscal and part of fiscal  sysco had several fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding 
these were entered into in fiscal as management believed that floating interest rates were more advantageous 
during fiscal  sysco terminated the fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding locking in effective yields on the related debt 
management believes that present market conditions reflect fixed long term rates near historical lows 
as such  management believes that fixed long term rates present a better opportunity than in the recent past and intends to issue long term debt at fixed rates with extended terms in september 
table of contents in the following tables  commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and the us commercial paper is classified as long term based on the maturity of the company s revolving loan agreement which supports the company s us commercial paper program and the company s intent to continue to refinance this facility on a long term basis

increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on the company s results of operations in three areas 
first  the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home 
second  the high cost of fuel can increase the price paid by sysco for product purchases for which sysco may not be able to pass these costs fully to its customers 
third  increased fuel costs impact the costs incurred by sysco to deliver product to its customers 
during fiscal  and  fuel costs represented approximately  and of sales  respectively 
fuel costs incurred by sysco in fiscal increased by approximately  over fiscal in order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs  sysco from time to time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of sysco s projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of july  were not material
