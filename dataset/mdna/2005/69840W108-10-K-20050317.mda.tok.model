the company includes information on company  franchisee  and or system wide comparable bakery cafe sales increases and average weekly sales 
system wide sales are a non gaap financial measure that includes sales at all company and franchise bakery cafes  as reported by franchisees 
management uses system wide sales information internally in connection with store development decisions  planning and budgeting analyses  and believes it is useful in assessing consumer acceptance of the company s brand and facilitates understanding of financial performance as the company s franchisees pay royalties and contribute to advertising pools based on a percentage of their sales 
the company s revenues are derived from company owned bakery cafe sales  fresh dough sales to franchisees  and franchise royalties and fees 
fresh dough sales to franchisees are primarily the sales of dough products to our franchisees and the sales of tuna and cream cheese to certain of our franchisees 
franchise royalties and fees include royalty income and franchise fees

following disclosure by several restaurant companies late in calendar and in connection with performing its year end reporting control processes  the company performed a comprehensive review of its lease accounting practices 
historically  the company recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the initial non cancelable term commencing upon location opening 
the company concluded that its calculation of straight line rent should be based on the reasonably assured lease term as defined in sfas  accounting for leases  which in most cases exceeds the initial non cancelable lease term 
the company further concluded that any construction period and other rent holidays should also be included in its determination of straight line rent expense 
additionally  the company reassessed the depreciable lives of leasehold improvements at all locations to be the shorter of their estimated useful life or the reasonably assured lease term at the inception of the lease 
the company also concluded that landlord allowances for normal tenant improvements  which had previously been recorded as a reduction to related leasehold improvements  should be reflected as deferred rent and amortized over the reasonably assured lease term as a reduction to rent expense rather than depreciation 
the company evaluated the materiality of these corrections on its financial statements and concluded that the incremental impact of these corrections is not material to any quarterly or annual period  however  the cumulative effect of these corrections is material to the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  the company has recorded the cumulative effect as of the end of fiscal year and has restated previously issued consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  and december  to recognize the impact of recording rent expense over the reasonably assured lease period  to record depreciation on leasehold improvements over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the reasonably assured lease term  and to classify landlord allowances for normal tenant improvements as deferred rent and amortize them over the reasonably assured lease term as a reduction to rent expense rather than depreciation

critical accounting policies estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions  and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts 

table of contents the company recognizes revenue upon delivery of product or performance of services as follows 
bakery cafe sales are recorded upon delivery of food and other products to a customer 
in addition  fresh dough sales to franchisees are recorded upon delivery of fresh dough to franchisees 
also  a liability is recorded in the period in which a gift card is issued and proceeds are received 
as gift cards are redeemed  this liability is reduced and revenue is recognized as a sale 
further  franchise fees are the result of sales of area development rights and the sale of individual franchise locations to third parties 
the initial franchise fee is  per bakery cafe to be developed under the area development agreement ada 
of this fee   is paid at the time of signing of the ada and is recognized as revenue when it is received as it is non refundable and the company has to perform no other service to earn this fee 
the remaining  is paid at the time an individual franchise agreement is signed and is recognized as revenue upon the commencement of franchise operations of the bakery cafes 
royalties are paid weekly based on a percentage of sales  ranging from to  as defined in the agreement 
royalties are recognized as revenue when they are earned 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset arising from charitable contribution carryforwards which it may not be able to utilize prior to their expiration 
the company s recorded net deferred tax asset is limited by the underlying tax benefit that it expects to ultimately realize 
an adjustment to income could be required if the company were to determine that it could realize tax benefits in amounts greater to or less than the amounts previously recorded 
intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill arising from the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
annually  and whenever an event or circumstance indicates it is more likely than not the company s goodwill has been impaired  management assesses the carrying value of its recorded goodwill 
the company performs its impairment assessment by comparing discounted cash flows from acquired businesses with the carrying value of the underlying net assets inclusive of goodwill 
in performing this analysis  management considers such factors as current results  trends  future prospects and other economic factors 
no event has been identified indicating an impairment in the value of the company s intangible assets 
the company is self insured for a significant portion of our workers compensation and general  auto  and property liability insurance 
we utilize third party actuarial experts estimates of expected losses based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as our own estimates based on our actual historical data to determine required insurance reserves 
these assumptions are closely reviewed  monitored  and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
actual experience related to number of claims and cost per claim could be more or less favorable than estimated resulting in expense reduction or increase 
the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the reasonably assured lease period 
certain of our lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy 
we include any rent escalations and construction and other rent holidays in our straight line rent expense 
in addition  we record landlord allowances for normal tenant improvements as deferred rent  which is included in accrued expenses or deferred rent in the consolidated balance sheets based on their short term or long term nature 
this deferred rent is amortized over the reasonably assured lease term as a reduction of rent expense 
also  leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related reasonably assured lease term

the company expects to fund these expenditures principally through internally generated cash flow and cash from the exercise of employee stock options supplemented  where necessary  by borrowings on its revolver 
in addition to our capital expenditure requirements  the company has certain other contractual and committed cash obligations 
the company s contractual cash obligations consist of noncancelable operating leases for its bakery cafes  fresh dough facilities and trucks  and administrative offices 
lease terms for its trucks are generally for five to seven years 
lease terms for its bakery cafes  fresh dough facilities  and administrative offices are generally for ten years with renewal options at most locations and generally require the company to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area  and other operating costs 
many bakery cafe leases provide for contingent rental ie  percentage rent payments based on sales in excess of specified amounts 
certain of the company s lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy

in november  the company signed an agreement with dawn food products  inc dawn to provide sweet goods for the period the agreement with dawn is structured as a cost plus agreement 
the transition from our previous provider of sweet goods to dawn was completed in the first quarter of fiscal beginning in fiscal  the company executed confidential and proprietary information and non competition agreements agreements with certain employees 
these agreements contain a provision whereby employees would be due a certain number of weeks of their salary if their employment was terminated by the company as specified in the agreement 
in accordance with sfas  the company has not recorded a liability for these amounts potentially due employees 
rather  the company will record a liability for these amounts when an amount becomes due to an employee 
as of december   the total amount potentially owed employees under these agreements was approximately million 
our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening or acquisition of additional bakery cafes and fresh dough facilities and maintenance and remodel expenditures  have and will continue to be significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and the exercise of employee stock options  supplemented  where necessary  by borrowings on our revolver  will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation in the past  the company has been able to recover inflationary cost and commodity price increases  including  among other things  fuel  butter  tuna  and cream cheese costs  through increased menu prices 
there have been  and there may be in the future  delays in implementing such menu price increases  and competitive pressures may limit the company s ability to recover such cost increases in their entirety 
historically  the effects of inflation on the company s net income have not been materially adverse 
a majority of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
although the company has and will continue to attempt to pass along any increased labor costs through food price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increased labor costs can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by consumers without diminishing to some degree consumer spending at the bakery cafes 
however  the company has not experienced to date a significant reduction in bakery cafe profit margins as a result of changes in such laws  and management does not anticipate any related future significant reductions in gross profit margins
