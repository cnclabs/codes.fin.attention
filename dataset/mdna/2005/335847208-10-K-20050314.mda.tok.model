executive summary the company  through its wholly owned bank subsidiary  operates a single line of business encompassing a general retail and commercial banking business primarily in the chicago metropolitan area 
the company is located in a highly competitive market  facing competition for banking and related financial services from many financial intermediaries 
competition among financial intermediaries is generally expressed in terms of interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits  the variety of financial products and services offered and the price of those products and services 
the company offers a full range of banking products and services such as demand  savings and time deposits  corporate treasury management services  merchant credit card processing and commercial and personal lending products 
the company also maintains a full service investment management and trust department  and in formed an investment sales center to execute investment transactions in us treasury  us government agency  corporate and municipal securities and mutual funds  primarily for commercial businesses  not for profit organizations  governmental entities and high net worth individuals and families 
during the second quarter of  the company s subsidiary  fobcm  will assume these investment transaction activities 
the profitability of the company s operations depends on net interest income  provision for loan losses  noninterest income  and noninterest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of interest earning assets relative to the amounts and costs of interest bearing liabilities  noninterest bearing liabilities and capital 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest and to the execution of the company s asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan losses is affected by growth in and changes to the composition of the loan portfolio  management s assessment of the quality and collectibility of the loan portfolio  loss experience  as well as economic and market factors that impact such matters 
noninterest income consists primarily of services charges from treasury management clients  merchant card processing fees  investment management and trust fee income  retail and small business fees  income from bank owned life insurance and covered call options  and to a lesser extent  gains on mortgages sold  securities dealer and annuity commissions and other ancillary income 
noninterest expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of the company s operations and branching structure including offering competitive salaries and benefits  merchant credit card interchange expense  advertising expense and any necessary provision for loss on other real estate owned 
the company s primary growth strategy continues to emphasize the expansion of branch locations in the chicago metropolitan area and particularly the western suburbs of chicago

application of critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience  projected results and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which 
table of contents could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
the company believes the policies that govern the allowance for loan losses and the deferred tax assets and liabilities are critical accounting policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses management of the bank prepares a detailed analysis  at least quarterly  reviewing the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses and  when appropriate  recommends an increase or decrease in its provision for loan losses 
the quarterly analysis is divided into two segments the allocated portion for specific loans and loan categories and the unallocated portion which is not specifically related to any specific segment of the portfolio 
the analysis to determine the allocated portion of the allowance is again divided into two parts 
the first part involves primarily an estimated calculation of losses on loans on the management watch list 
the company s management watch list includes all nonaccrual loans  nonperforming loans and potential problem loans and related commitments 
although the management watch list includes the company s properties in oreo  these assets are reviewed individually and not included in the allowance for loan loss calculation see asset quality 
loans on the management watch list are classified as special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss 
an asset is classified as substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and requiring charge off 
assets that do not currently expose the company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess weaknesses that may or may not be within the control of the customer are deemed to be special mention 
the second part of the allocated portion involves primarily a calculation of the bank s actual net charge off history excluding the fraud loss in averaged with industry net charge off history by major loan categories 
the bank also employs a rating system for loans in its commercial lending and commercial real estate departments 
loans that are rated in certain categories may require a higher allocation 
the unallocated portion of the reserve involves a higher degree of subjectivity in its determination 
the bank considers its portfolio composition  loan growth  management capabilities  economic trends  credit concentrations  industry risks  underlying collateral values and the opinions of bank management 
because the criteria for both the allocated and unallocated portion is subject to change  the allocation of the allowance is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
in order to identify potential risks in the loan portfolio and determine the necessary provision for loan losses  detailed information is obtained from the following sources monthly reports prepared by the bank s management and reviewed by the loan committee which contain information on the overall characteristics of the loan portfolio  including delinquencies  nonaccruals and specific analysis of potential problem loans that require special attention ie management watch list  examinations of the loan portfolio of the bank by federal and state regulatory agencies  including shared national credit reviews of syndicated loans  reviews by third party credit review consultants 
for additional disclosures regarding the allowance for loan losses  refer to the section titled allowance for loan losses in this form k 

table of contents income taxes the company accounts for income tax expense by applying statutory tax rates to federal and state taxable income 
federal and state taxable income is calculated based on management s judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes 
in addition  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on management s judgments and estimates regarding temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is unlikely 
in making this assessment  management must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years  the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income  and the possible application of future tax planning strategies 
while the company has determined that a valuation allowance is not required for all deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee that these assets are realizable 
for additional disclosures on income taxes  see the section titled income tax expense and note to the company s financial statements under item of this form k 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans  investments  and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest spread is the difference between the average rates on interest earning assets and the average rates on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate margin represents net interest income divided by average earning assets 
the effective rate paid for all funding sources is lower than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities alone because a significant portion of the company s funding is derived from interest free sources  primarily demand deposits and shareholders equity

the changes in net interest income and the net interest margin were primarily the result of the following rate the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points to while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to for the federal reserve reduced the fed funds rate by basis points in june the fed funds rate stayed constant until june  at which time the federal reserve began raising rates gradually doing so five times for an aggregate increase of basis points by december margin compression was partially the result of being liability sensitive liabilities reprice more quickly than assets as interest rates rose  competitive pressures on loan and deposit pricing and the flattening of the yield curve 
the decrease in the yield on average earning assets is due primarily to growth in lower yielding asset categories investments and indirect auto loans 
the investment portfolio yield was compressed partially as a result of the overall shortening of the contractual maturity of the portfolio to years at december  from years at december  and a reduction in accretion income 
in addition  the company experienced an overall decrease in loan fees of  representing a seven basis point decline in the yield on average earning assets in as compared to primarily due to a decrease in prepayment penalties and contingent fee arrangements 
although loan fees are amortized to income over the loan period as a normal part of the business  the additional fees associated with the prepayment of loans are less predictable and  during periods of higher prepayment activity  can result in a spike in earnings since these fees are recorded in income when received 
the decrease in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities is due primarily to growth in public fund time deposits which typically have a lower cost and shorter terms than promotional rate retail time deposits

such differences are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a net deferred tax asset totaling  is recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  under fas  deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance is required  the company considers the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years  the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  and future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
based on this assessment  a valuation allowance of  is required on the state net operating loss carryforward as disclosed in note to the company s financial statements under item of this form k 
financial condition liquidity effective management of balance sheet liquidity is necessary to fund growth in earning assets  to meet maturing obligations and depositors withdrawal requirements  to pay shareholders dividends  and to purchase treasury stock under stock repurchase programs 
the company has numerous sources of liquidity including readily marketable investment securities  shorter term loans within the loan portfolio  principal and interest cash flows from investments and loans  the ability to attract retail and public fund time deposits and to purchase brokered time deposits and access to various borrowing arrangements

interest rate sensitivity the business of the company and the composition of its balance sheet consist of investments in interest earning assets primarily loans and investment securities which are primarily funded by interest bearing liabilities deposits and borrowings 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market rates of interest 
the net income of the company depends  to a substantial extent  on the differences between the income the company receives from loans  investment securities  and other earning assets and the interest expense it pays to obtain deposits and other liabilities 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the company  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities  such as the federal reserve bank 
in addition  since the company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities are customer deposits  the company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer preferences and local competition in the market areas in which the company operates 
the company manages its overall interest rate sensitivity through various measurement techniques including rate shock analysis 
in addition  as part of the risk management process  asset and liability management policies are established and monitored by management 
the policy objective is to limit the change in annual net interest income to from an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates of plus or minus basis points 
however  as a result of interest rate levels at december  and  the company assumed rates will not decline basis points 
as such  the scale shown below reflects a more reasonable plus or minus and basis points in addition to a plus basis point rate shock 
at december  and  the company was within policy objectives based on its models 

table of contents bp bp bp bp bp dollars in thousands annual net interest income change from an immediate change in rates percent change bp bp bp bp bp dollars in thousands annual net interest income change from an immediate change in rates percent change rate shock analysis assesses the risk of changes in annual net interest income in the event of an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates 
the profile as of december  indicates a basis point increase in interest rates generates a decrease in net interest income of  or a reduction in base case projected net interest income 
when interest rates are shocked down basis points  an increase in net interest income of  or 
of base case projected net interest income would result 
these projections should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results that would be experienced if such interest rate changes occurred 
the interest rate sensitivity presented includes assumptions that i the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at period end will remain constant over the twelve month measurement period and ii that changes in market interest rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve 
this analysis is also limited by the fact that it does not include any balance sheet repositioning actions the company may take such as lengthening or shortening the duration of the securities portfolio  should severe movements in interest rates occur 
these repositioning actions would likely reduce the variability of net interest income shown in the extreme interest rate shock forecasts 
the change in the company s risk profile from december  is primarily due to growth and changes in the composition of the balance sheet  as well as changes in interest rates from prior year end levels 
the following gap analysis is prepared based on the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for selected time periods 
the mismatch between asset and liability repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the gap for that period 
the following table presents a static gap analysis as of december  which shows that the company s rate sensitive liabilities may reprice more quickly than its rate sensitive assets 
however  the gap report does not capture the true dynamics of interest rate changes including the timing and or degree of interest rate changes 
while most of the asset categories rates change when certain independent indices such as the prime rate  fed funds rate  libor change  most liability categories are repriced at the company s discretion subject  however  to competitive interest rate pressures 
also  the gap report does not reflect the call associated with

the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments is limited to their contractual amount 
many commitments expire without being used 
therefore  the amounts stated below do not necessarily represent future cash commitments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend funds to a customer as long as there is no material violation of any condition established in the contract 
specifically  home equity lines are reviewed annually  and the bank has the ability to deny any future extensions of credit based upon the borrowers credit 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer s obligation to a third party 
financial standby letters of credit are conditional guarantees of payment to a third party on behalf of a customer of the company
