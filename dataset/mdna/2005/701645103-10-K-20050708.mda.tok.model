item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
except for the historical matters contained herein  statements made in this annual report are forward looking and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act of critical accounting policies and estimates sec financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr see note to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for intangible assets 
the value of our intangible assets  including brand licenses and trademarks  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review intangible assets for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  during the company s fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or sooner  if events indicate a potential impairment 
the identification and measurement of impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets involves the estimation of the fair value of the related asset 
the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management ass umptions about discounted expected future cash flows 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions 
allowance for sales returns 
as is customary in the prestige fragrance industry  we grant certain of our unrelated us department store customers the right to return product which does not sell through to consumers 
at the time of sale  we record a provision for estimated product returns based on our historical sell through experience  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
based upon this information  we provide an allowance for sales returns 
it is only after the specific gift giving season mother s day  christmas  etc 
that the customer requests approval of the return for unsold items 
we decide to accept returns on a case by case basis 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the allowance for returns and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed  reducing net income or increasing net loss 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectable accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers  or any one customer  deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
inventory write downs 
we record inventory write downs for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  or changes in consumer preferences  additional inventory write downs may be necessary 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period of such determination 
stock based compensation 
we account for our compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share is required in order to show our net income as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition disclosure 
this information is contained in note t to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair values of options and shares issued pursuant to our plans at each grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees 
currently  companies are required to calculate the estimated fair value of these share based payments and can elect to either include the estimated cost in earnings or disclose the pro forma effect in the footnotes to their financial statements 
as discussed above  we have chosen to disclose the pro forma effect 
the fair value concepts were not changed significantly in sfas no 
r  however  in adopting sfas n r  companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions 
the valuation model and amortization assumption used by us continues to be available  however  we have not yet completed our assessment of the alternatives 
sfas no 
r will be effective for the company beginning with the year starting april  transition options allow companies to choose whether to adopt prospectively  restate results to the beginning of the year  or to restate prior periods with the amounts that have been included in the footnotes 
we have not yet concluded on which transition option it will select 
see note t to our consolidated financial statements for the pro forma effect for the each of the years presented  using our existing valuation and amortization assumptions 
since april we have not made any changes of these critical accounting policies  nor have we made any material changes in any of the critical accounting estimates underlying these accounting policies 
significant trends 
over the last few years  a significant number of new prestige fragrance products have been introduced on a worldwide basis 
the beauty industry in general is highly competitive and consumer preferences often change rapidly 
the initial appeal of these new fragrances  launched for the most part in us department stores  has fueled the growth of our industry 
department stores continue to lose sales to the mass market as a product matures 
to counter the effect of lower department store sales  companies are required to introduce new products more quickly  which requires additional spending for development and advertising and promotional expenses 
in addition  a number of the new launches are with celebrities either entertainers or athletes which require substantial royalty commitments and whose careers and or appeal could change drastically  both positively and negatively  based on a single event 
we believe these trends will continue 
if one or more of our new product introductions would be unsuccessful  or the appeal of the celebrity would diminish  it could result in a substantial reduction in profitability and operating cash flows 
results of operation 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other entities that include all of the costs related to their distribution network in costs of goods sold as compared to our allocating only a portion of these distribution costs to costs of goods sold and including the remaining unallocated amounts as selling and distribution expenses 
comparison of the year ended march  with the year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   net sales increased to  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase was mainly attributable to  the introduction of our new paris hilton fragrance  which commenced shipping in november and achieved gross sales of  the launch of blue for men and women in september  coupled with the full distribution of products launched in the prior year  resulted in an increase of  in total perry ellis brand sales from  to  and   in gross sales of xoxo brand products  which license was acquired during january the increase was partially offset by a reduction in gross sales of chaleur d animale and fred hayman indigo brand products of  and  respectively 
see note c to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discu ssion of the animale and fred hayman brands 
net sales to unrelated customers increased to  compared to  for the prior year  mainly as a result of the paris hilton brand sales discussed above  as  of such sales were made to unrelated customers 
sales to related parties increased to  compared to  for the prior year  mainly as a result of the perry ellis brand increase offset by the reduction in animale and fred hayman brand products  discussed above 
we expect that sales increases to unrelated customers in the upcoming fiscal year will outpace those of related customers with the further roll out of our paris hilton fragrance products  and our initial guess fragrance product anticipated during the summer season which will initially be sold mainly to unrelated customers 
our overall cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of net sales to for the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the prior year 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to unrelated customers and related parties approximated and  respectively  for the current year  as compared to for both groups during the prior year 
for the prior two fiscal years  the cost of goods sold to unrelated customers increased  and consequently gross margins decreased  due to a higher percentage of value sets being sold 
value sets  which include multiple products  have a higher cost of goods compared to basic stock items 
the prior year included a higher percentage of value set sales to unrelated customers 
additionally  the current year sales of paris hilton brand products included a higher percentage of basic stock items 
for the near future  we anticipate the percentage of value sets sold to unrelated customers will remain constant and that the overall cost of goods sold to unrelated customers will also remain relatively constant 
operating expenses increased by compared to the prior year from  to  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
however  individual components of our operating expenses experienced more significant changes 
advertising and promotional expenses increased to  compared to  in the prior year  increasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
this trend should continue  in line with projected sales increases to the us department store channel  which requires increased promotional support 
the current year includes approximately  of promotional costs for the recently introduced paris hilton fragrance 
selling and distribution costs increased to  in the current year compared to  for the prior year  remaining relatively constant at of net sales 
the increase was mainly attributable to additional costs for tempor ary warehouse employees and warehouse storage space to handle the increased order flow  coupled with increases in salaries and health insurance costs for sales and warehouse personnel 
general and administrative expenses decreased slightly compared to the prior year from  to  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in legal and other professional fees and non recurring charitable contributions  offset by increases in salaries  health insurance costs and bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization increased by during the current year from  to  amortization of intangibles of approximately  relating to the january xoxo license acquisition see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion were offset by a reduction in depreciation  as molds used in production for certain ocean pacific brand products became fully depreciated 
royalties decreased by in the current year from  to  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the prior year included approximately  in minimum royalties payable under the jockey license agreement  which were no longer required 
the jockey license expired on december  and was not renewed 
as a result of the above factors  operating income increased to  or of net sales for the current year  compared to  or of net sales for the prior year 
net interest income was  as compared to net interest expense of  for the prior year 
we did not borrow during the current year and invested our excess cash in money market deposit accounts 
income before taxes for the current year was  compared to  in the prior year 
giving effect to the tax provision  we earned net income of  or of net sales for the current year compared to  or of net sales in the prior year 
comparison of the year ended march  with the year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   net sales increased to  compared to  for the prior year 
the increase is mainly attributable to the launch of perry m  perry f  and red for men and women under the perry ellis line of fragrances  which resulted in an increase of  in total perry ellis brand gross sales from  to  and  the launch of ocean pacific for men and women  which resulted in an increase in total ocean pacific brand gross sales of  these increases were offset by the reduction in gross sales of animale and fhbh brand products of  and  respectively which brands were sold and sublicensed during january and march  respectively and a  reduction in gross sales of jockey brand products 
net sales to unrelated customers decreased to  compared to  for the prior year  as a result of the reductions discussed above 
additionally  the prior year included the launch of perry man and perry woman  for which the fiscal year ended march  gross sales decreased  compared to the prior launch year period 
net sales to related parties increased to  compared to  for the prior year  as brands  which were originally launched in the us department store market over the last few years reached full distribution potential 
in addition  the products launched during the current period have been developed for immediate distribution in all of the company s channels 
we anticipate that this trend in distribution channels will continue until the launch of a new perry ellis brand fragrance product  and the launch of the initia l guess fragrance product 
our overall cost of goods sold remained relatively stable as a percentage of net sales  decreasing from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  cost of goods sold on sales to unrelated customers and related parties both approximated for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to and  respectively  for the prior year 
the increase in cost of goods sold to unrelated customers for the fiscal year ended march  was due to the purchase by unrelated parties of a higher percentage of value sets than in the prior year 
these value sets have a higher cost of goods when compared to basic stock items 
for the last two fiscal years  the cost of goods sold to unrelated customers has increased  and consequently gross margins have decreased  due to a greater number of value sets sold as discussed above 
the fiscal year ended march  al so includes the sale of a higher percentage of basic stock items to related parties  which result in higher margins 
operating expenses increased slightly compared to the prior year from  to  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
however  individual components of our operating expenses experienced more significant changes 
advertising and promotional expenses decreased to  compared to  in the prior year  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the prior year included promotional costs for perry man and perry woman  which launched during the fall of no such major launches occurred during the fiscal year ended march  selling and distribution costs increased slightly to  in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  for the prior year  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase was mainly attributable to increases in employee salaries and health insurance prem iums offset by a reduction in commissions paid to an international sales representative who previously sold fhbh products in the caribbean and to reduced commissions to a sales representative in mexico 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company increased its focus on the mexican marketplace and engaged a distributor for mexico in lieu of a commissioned representative 
this distributor is owned and operated by individuals related to our chairman chief executive officer 
general and administrative expenses increased by compared to the prior year from  to  increasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase is mainly attributable to increases in employee salaries  health insurance premiums  legal and professional fees  and non recurring charitable contributions  offset by a reduction in bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization decreased by during the fiscal year ended march  from  to  royalties increased by in the fiscal year ended march   increasing as a percentage of net sales from to as a result of minimum royalty requirements on jockey brand products 
as a result of the above factors  operating income increased to  or of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   compared to  or of net sales for the prior year 
net interest expense decreased to  in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the prior year 
the decrease reflects a lower average balance outstanding under our line of credit as compared to the prior year  coupled with increased interest income generated on notes receivable 
the fiscal year ended march  includes foreign exchange gains of  relating to the sales and collection activities with our canadian distributor  the only country where we assume foreign exchange risk  due to the strengthening of the canadian currency against the us dollar 
the prior year includes other income of  relating to the settlement of a lawsuit we filed in against a su pplier see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the litigation settlement 
income before taxes for the fiscal year ended march  was  compared to  in the prior year 
giving effect to the tax provision  we earned net income of  for the fiscal year ended march   compared to  in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to  at march  compared to  at march   the result of current year s net income  offset by the funds used for the xoxo acquisition see note b to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
during the fiscal year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was  compared with  in the prior year 
the improvement was mainly attributable to the increase in net income of  and the  decrease in trade receivables from related parties 
net cash used in investing activities was  in the current year  the result of  in payments in connection with the xoxo acquisition  referenced above  compared to cash provided by investing activities of  in the prior year 
the cash provided by financing activities during the current year was attributable to the release of  in restricted cash resulting from the full pay down on our line of credit 
we also purchased  of treasury stock during the current period see below 
additionally  we generated  and  of cash during the years ended march  and  respectively  from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain warrants and employee options 
see note for further discussion 
the cash provided by operating and investing activities during the prior year was used to reduce debt  both long term and under our line of credit  as well as repurchase  of our common stock 
as of march  and  our ratios of the number of days sales in accounts receivable and inventory  on a day basis  were as follows march  trade accounts receivable unrelated related total inventories calculated on gross trade receivables excluding allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and advertising allowances of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the increase in the number of day sales in accounts receivable from unrelated customers is attributable to the increase in gross sales to this customer group during the quarter ended march  the above calculation uses sales for the entire fiscal year 
if only the last quarter was used  the number of days outstanding would have been  reasonable for this customer group mix of us department stores and international distributors 
based on current circumstances  we anticipate this number of days to remain at approximately days 
during prior years  the number of days sales in trade receivables from related parties exceeded those of unrelated customers  due mainly to the highly seasonal cash flow of perfumania see item customers for further discussion of our relationship with perfumania 
although we expect this to continue  based on current information and published information concerning perfumania s increased borrowing capability and improved profitability  we anticipate a continuing improvement in the days outstanding  while still encountering some seasonal peaks 
due to the lead time for certain of our raw materials and components inventory up to days  we are required to maintain a three to six month supply of some items in order to ensure production schedules 
in addition  when we launch a new brand or stock keeping unit  we often produce a six month supply to ensure adequate inventories if the new products exceed our forecasted expectations 
we believe that the significant gross margins on our products outweigh the additional carrying costs 
the improvement in turnover between and is attributable to the increase in sales for the comparable period  which resulted in a increase in total cost of goods sold  while inventories increased by only 
as of december   we had repurchased  under all phases of our common stock buy back program  a total of  shares at a cost of  on february   we received approval from our lender to purchase an additional  shares not to exceed  which was ratified on february   by the board 
as of march   we had repurchased  in the open market  an additional  shares at a cost of  under this approval 
on august   the board approved the repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock  subject to certain limitations  including approval from our lender  which was subsequently received  for up to  on august  as of march   we repurchased  in the open market   shares at a cost of  the accompanying consolidated balance sheets also include an additional  shares of treasury stock purchased at a cost of  prior to fiscal during the period april  through june   we repurchased an additional  shares at a cost of  on july   we entered into a three year loan and security agreement the loan agreement with gmac commercial credit llc gmaccc 
on january   the loan agreement was extended for an additional year through july  under the loan agreement  we are able to borrow  on a revolving basis  depending upon the availability of a borrowing base  up to  at an interest rate of libor plus or the bank of new york s prime rate  at our option 
at march   based on the borrowing base at that date  availability under the credit line amounted to approximately  none of which was utilized 
substantially all of our domestic assets collateralize this borrowing 
the loan agreement contains customary events of default and covenants which prohibit  among other things  incurring additional indebtedness in excess of a specified amount  paying dividends  creating liens  and engaging in mergers and acquisitions without the prior consent of gmaccc 
the loan agreement also contains certain financial covenants relating to net worth  interest coverage and other financial ratios  which we were in compliance with 
as of march   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
management believes that funds from operations and our existing financing will be sufficient to meet our current operating needs 
however  if we would expand operations through acquisitions  new licensing arrangements or both  we may need to obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that we could obtain such additional financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations as of march  in s for the year ending march  thereafter total type of obligation operating lease obligations purchase obligations advertising obligations other long term obligations represents purchase orders issued in the normal course of business for components  raw materials and promotional supplies 
consists of advertising commitments under our licensing agreements 
these amounts were calculated based on the guaranteed minimum sales goals  as set forth in the agreements 
unlike guaranteed minimum royalties  advertising and promotional spending are based on a percentage of actual net sales  and are not contractually required if there are no sales 
see note b to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these amounts 
consists of guaranteed minimum royalty requirements under our licensing agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in regulation s k item a 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s with the exception of canada  we sell our products worldwide with all such sales being denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  we are not at risk to foreign exchange translation exposure  other than with our canadian distributor where we assume such risk 
we believe a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and canadian dollar would not have a material effect on our consolidated statement of income 
we could  however  be subject to changes in political and economic conditions in many of these countries 
we closely monitor such conditions and are able  for the most part  to adjust our sales strategies accordingly 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we recorded foreign exchange losses gains of  and  respectively  relating to sales collection activity with our canadian distributor 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our bank line of credit  when utilized 
the bank line of credit bears interest at a variable rate  as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources 
we mitigate interest rate risk by continuously monitoring the interest rates and electing the lower of the fixed rate libor or prime rate option available under the line of credit 
when borrowing for our operating and investing activities  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
as of march  and  the primary source of funds for working capital and other needs was our million line of credit 
the line of credit  which was not utilized as of march   bears interest at a floating rate of prime 
we believe hypothetical adverse move in interest rates would not significantly effect future interest expense
