item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview manor care  inc  which we also refer to as manor care or hcr manor care  provides a range of health care services  including skilled nursing care  assisted living  subacute medical and rehabilitation care  hospice care  home health care and rehabilitation therapy 
long term care 
the most significant portion of our business relates to long term care  including skilled nursing care and assisted living 
on december   we operated skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities in states with percent of our facilities located in florida  illinois  michigan  ohio and pennsylvania 
within some of our centers  we have medical specialty units which provide subacute medical and rehabilitation care and or alzheimer s care programs 
the table below details the activity in the number of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities and beds during the past three years 
the additions represent facilities built or transferred out of assets held for sale 
the divestitures include facilities that were sold  closed or converted into a long term acute care hospital ltach  as well as facilities with a lease that expired or was assigned 
we sold certain facilities that no longer fit our strategic growth plan 
their results of operations are insignificant to us 
we currently have one skilled nursing facility under construction and the conversion of a facility into an ltach as part of a joint venture 
we expect both to open in we have not included in the table any activity related to expansion of beds in existing facilities 
facilities beds facilities beds facilities beds skilled nursing facilities additions divestitures assisted living facilities additions divestitures hospice and home health 
our hospice and home health business includes all levels of hospice care  home care and rehabilitation therapy with offices in states 
the growth in our hospice and home health business is primarily a result of opening additional offices and expansion of our hospice client base in existing markets where we benefit from our long term care relationship 
we also had growth from small acquisitions 

table of contents other health care services 
in addition to the rehabilitation provided in each of our skilled nursing centers  we provide rehabilitation therapy in our outpatient therapy clinics and at work sites  schools and hospitals 
our outpatient therapy clinics are located in midwestern and mid atlantic states  texas and florida 
on april   we completed the sale of our mesquite  texas acute care hospital to health management associates  inc  or hma  for million in cash 
separately  we invested million to acquire percent of the hma entity owning the hospital 
the total gain on the sale of the hospital was million 
we recorded a pretax gain of million and deferred million  or percent  of the gain 
simultaneously  we acquired for million a percent interest in an hma entity that had recently acquired another hospital in mesquite  texas 
other services 
we are a majority owner of a medical transcription company that converts medical dictation into electronically formatted patient records 
health care providers use the records in connection with patient care and other administrative purposes 
medicare and medicaid payments 
government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid prescribe  by law  the billing methods and amounts that may be charged and reimbursed to care for patients covered by these programs 
in recent years  congress has passed a number of laws that have effected major changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
the balanced budget act of  or the budget act  sought to achieve a balanced federal budget by  among other things  reducing federal spending on medicare and medicaid 
the budget act contained numerous changes affecting medicare and medicaid payments to skilled nursing facilities  home health agencies  hospices and therapy providers  among others 
prior to the budget act  medicare reimbursed skilled nursing facilities under a cost based reimbursement system 
effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after july   the budget act adopted a prospective payment system in which medicare reimburses skilled nursing facilities at a daily rate for specific covered services  regardless of their actual cost  based on various categories of patients 
the budget act also required a prospective payment system to be established for home health services  which began october  in addition  the budget act reduced payments to many providers and suppliers  including therapy providers and hospices  and gave states greater flexibility to administer their medicaid programs by repealing the federal requirement that payment be reasonable and adequate to cover the costs of efficiently and economically operated nursing facilities 
in and  congress passed legislation to redress certain reductions in medicare reimbursement resulting from the budget act 
further refinements also were made by the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  or mma  which was signed into law december  several provisions of these bills continue to positively affect us  as follows 
table of contents a temporary increase in the payment for certain high cost nursing home patients  for services provided beginning april  and continuing at least until the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  implements a refined patient classification to better account for medically complex patients 
cms did not implement such refinements in fiscal years or president bush s proposed fiscal year budget includes the implementation of the refinements in fiscal specific services or items  such as ambulance services in conjunction with renal dialysis  chemotherapy items and prosthetic devices  furnished on or after april   may be reimbursed outside of the prospective payment system daily rate 
a two year moratorium on the annual  therapy cap indexed for inflation on each of physical speech therapy and occupational therapy beginning with services provided on or after january  later legislation amended this provision  extending the moratorium through december  the per beneficiary limits  which were adjusted for inflation to  were imposed beginning september  the mma suspends application of the therapy caps from december  through calendar year while certain of the increases in medicare reimbursement for skilled nursing facilities expired on september  the so called medicare cliff  we offset the decrease in medicare revenues by a shift in the payor mix of our patients to a higher percentage of medicare patients 
further  effective october   cms increased skilled nursing facility payment rates for fiscal year by providing a percent inflation update  and an additional percent rate increase to reflect forecast error underpayments since effective october   cms increased skilled nursing facility payment rates by percent 
no assurances can be given as to whether congress will increase or decrease reimbursement in the future  the timing of any action or the form of relief  if any  that may be enacted 
we face challenges with respect to states medicaid payments since many currently do not cover the total costs incurred in providing care to those patients 
budgetary pressures continue at the state level and could have an effect on available funding for medicaid services 
states will continue to control medicaid expenditures but also look for adequate funding sources 
our medicaid rates increased percent between and we expect our medicaid rates to increase between percent in president bush s proposed fiscal year budget includes several medicaid reforms that could affect federal funding 
due to pressure on many states budgets  there is no assurance that the funding for our services will increase or decrease in the future 
labor 
labor costs consist of wages  temporary nursing staffing and payroll overhead  including workers compensation 
labor costs account for approximately percent of the 
table of contents operating expenses of our long term care segment 
our long term care wage rate increases in were approximately percent 
we continued to decrease our temporary staffing expense and workers compensation expense in see additional discussion of workers compensation under critical accounting policies 
we compete with other health care providers to attract and retain qualified or skilled personnel 
we also compete with various industries for lower wage employees 
although we currently do not face a staffing shortage in all markets where we operate  we have used high priced temporary help to supplement staffing levels in markets with shortages of health care workers 
since  we have implemented additional training and education programs which have helped with retention of employees 
our temporary staffing costs for our long term care segment decreased by percent between and and percent between and if a shortage of nurses or other health care workers occurred in all geographic areas in which we operate  it could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and could further increase our operating costs 
general and professional liability costs 
patient care liability is still a serious industry wide cost issue 
the health care industry is making progress in state legislatures and at the national level to enact tort reform 
with tort reform and our proactive management initiatives  our number of new claims has decreased and our average settlement cost per claim has a downward trend 
during  strong tort reform legislation capping medical malpractice awards was passed in texas and upheld by a state constitutional amendment 
other key states made a start at meaningful tort reform 
the long term care industry received some assistance with the passage of a measure of tort reform in florida in may that became fully effective on october  the legislation included caps on punitive damages  limits to add on legal fees  tougher rules of evidence and a reduced statute of limitations 
while we cannot insure that any of these or other legislative changes will have a positive impact on the current trend  we believe that these changes were an important first step in achieving more balanced tort laws in our country 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 

table of contents receivables and revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when the related patient services are provided 
the revenues are based on established daily or monthly rates adjusted to amounts estimated to be received under governmental programs and other third party contractual arrangements 
receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by us to be the net realizable value 
no individual customer or group of customers accounts for a significant portion of our revenues or receivables 
certain classes of patients rely on a common source of funds to pay the cost of their care  such as the federal medicare program and various state medicaid programs 
medicare program revenues for the years prior to the implementation of the prospective payment system and certain medicaid program revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by government representatives 
we believe that any differences between the net revenues recorded and final determination will not materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor type  historical collection trends and aging categories 
the percentage that we apply to the receivable balances is based on our historical experience and time limits  if any  for each particular pay source  such as private  insurance  medicare and medicaid 
impairment of property and equipment and intangible assets 
we evaluate our property and equipment and intangible assets on a quarterly basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or the life of the asset may need to be changed 
we consider internal and external factors of the individual facility or asset  including changes in the regulatory environment  changes in national health care trends  current period cash flow loss combined with a history of cash flow losses  and local market developments 
if these factors and the projected undiscounted cash flow of the entity over its remaining life indicate that the asset will not be recoverable  the carrying value will be adjusted to its fair value if it is lower 
if our projections or assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for our assets 
general and professional liability 
we purchase general and professional liability insurance and have maintained an unaggregated self insured retention per occurrence ranging from million to million  depending on the policy year and state 
in addition  for the policy period beginning june   we formed a captive insurance entity to provide a coverage layer of million in excess of million per claim 
our general and professional reserves include amounts for patient care related claims and incurred but not reported claims 
the amount of our reserves is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data 
the estimation process requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of the claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about emerging trends  we along with our independent actuary develop information about the size of ultimate claims 
table of contents based on our historical experience and other available industry information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in costs  the expected cost of claims incurred but not reported and the expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
our assumptions take into consideration our internal efforts to contain our costs by reviewing our risk management programs  our operational and clinical initiatives  and other industry changes affecting the long term care market 
we also monitor the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior year estimation process and adjust our current year assumptions accordingly 
semi annually  our independent actuary evaluates our reserve levels 
we do see an improving trend in terms of patient liability costs 
the number of new claims in decreased compared to  and was similar to our average settlement cost per claim has a downward trend over the past three years 
our independent actuary provides us with a range of indicated loss reserves in the second quarter and fourth quarter every year 
based on our own review of trends and confirmed with our independent actuary s fourth quarter analysis  it was determined that we would lower our accrual rate by approximately million on a quarterly basis in the fourth quarter of we were able to lower our accrual rate by approximately million per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of we expect our accrual for current claims per month to be million through our policy period ending may  at december  and  our general and professional liability consisted of short term reserves of million and million  respectively  and long term reserves of million and million  respectively 
the expense for general and professional liability claims  premiums and administrative fees was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although we believe our liability reserves are adequate and appropriate  we can give no assurance that these reserves will not require material adjustment in future periods 
workers compensation liability 
our workers compensation reserves are determined based on an estimation process that uses company specific data 
we continuously monitor the claims and develop information about the ultimate cost of the claims based on our historical experience 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in costs  the expected costs of claims incurred but not reported and the expected future costs related to existing claims 
in addition  we review industry trends  changes in the regulatory environment and our internal efforts to contain our costs with safety and training programs 
during and continuing into  we expanded and increased attention to our safety  training and claims management programs 
the number of new claims in decreased in comparison to the prior years 
as a result of these factors  our workers compensation expense decreased million from to and decreased million from to at december  and  the workers compensation liability consisted of short term reserves of million and million  respectively  and long term reserves of million and million  respectively 
although we believe our liability reserves are adequate and appropriate  we can give no assurance that these reserves will not require material adjustment in future periods 

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues

this review  which was conducted by the department of justice and the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  focused primarily on nursing cost allocations made in reliance upon instructions from the facilities medicare fiscal intermediary for the period we believe the mca facilities were fully entitled to the reimbursement they received for these allocations 
the definitive settlement agreement was finalized and million paid in the second quarter of operating expenses from our long term care segment increased million  or percent  between and the largest portion of the long term care operating expense increase of 
table of contents million related to labor costs 
our average wage rates increased percent compared with our other operating expense increase for this segment included ancillary costs  excluding internal labor  of million 
ancillary costs  which include various types of therapies  medical supplies and prescription drugs  increased as a result of our more medically complex patients 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in our general and professional liability expense by million because of the decrease in our claims accrual 
refer to our overview and critical accounting policies for additional discussion of our general and professional liability costs 
our operating expenses from our hospice and home health segment increased million  or percent  between and the increase in our costs was directly related to the growth in our business 
the increase related to labor costs of million  ancillary costs including pharmaceuticals of million and other direct nursing care costs  including medical equipment and supplies  of million 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses decreased million from to the decrease in expense primarily related to costs associated with our stock appreciation rights and deferred compensation plans 
during  our stock price increased over percent  which resulted in a significant increase in expense 
during  our stock price has been stable and  as a result  no major fluctuations occurred in this expense 
the decrease in these costs included in general and administrative expenses was million 
in  we terminated our split dollar arrangements covering an executive life insurance program and transferred our share of the split dollar life insurance policies to the officers and key employees 
this action resulted in a charge of million and was taken to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of and contractual requirements  as well as to address tax law changes 
depreciation and amortization 
our depreciation expense increased million from to excluding our divested facilities  depreciation expense increased million because of new construction projects and renovations to existing facilities

our gain on sale of assets in primarily related to the sale of non strategic land parcels and securities 

table of contents income taxes 
our effective tax rate was percent in compared with percent in our effective tax rate was lower in primarily because of the adjustment of prior years estimated federal and state tax liabilities 
in  the internal revenue service completed the examination of our federal income tax returns through we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately percent for inflation 
we believe that inflation has had no material impact on our results of operations 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
our revenues increased million from to excluding the results of our hospital that we sold in  revenues increased million  or percent  compared with revenues from our long term care segment increased million  or percent  primarily due to increases in rates patient mix of million and occupancy of million that were partially offset by a decrease in capacity of million 
our revenues from the hospice and home health segment increased million  or percent  primarily because of an increase in hospice patient days 
our rate increases for the long term care segment related only to medicaid and private pay sources 
our average medicaid rate increased percent from per day in to per day in our average private and other rates for our skilled nursing facilities increased percent from per day in to per day in the increase in overall rates was also a result of the shift in the mix of our patients to a higher percentage of medicare patients  even though the average medicare rate decreased percent from per day in to per day in the rate decreased because certain increases in medicare reimbursement for skilled nursing facilities expired on september   the so called medicare cliff 
the rate reduction from the medicare cliff was partially offset by the increase in rates in the fourth quarter of as a result of inflationary increases and to make up for previous cms forecast error underpayments 
in the fourth quarter of  our average medicare rate was per day  an increase of per day over the third quarter of our occupancy levels increased from percent for to percent for excluding start up facilities  our occupancy levels were percent for and percent for our occupancy levels for skilled nursing facilities were percent for and percent for in the fourth quarter of  our skilled nursing occupancy increased to percent

general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased million compared with the significant expense in related to the increase in costs associated with our stock appreciation rights and deferred compensation plans 
the increase in these costs included in general and administrative expenses was million and primarily resulted from an increase in our stock price of over percent 
the increase in costs related to stock appreciation rights and deferred compensation plans was recorded in both general and administrative expenses and operating expenses 
the total increase for these expenses was million 
in  we recorded a million charge related to the restructuring of our split dollar insurance arrangements which fund one of our senior executive retirement plans 
under these arrangements  the officers are owners of the life insurance policies subject to an assignment to manor care of an interest in the policy cash value equal to the premiums paid by us 
because of the possible interpretation that our future payment of premiums on these policies would be considered a prohibited loan under the sarbanes oxley act of  we suspended future 
table of contents premium payments following the passage of that act 
policy dividend values are currently being used to pay the required portion of the annual premiums 
in addition  under the split dollar assignment agreements  the transaction with mca in required us to set aside cash for future premium payments or to reallocate a portion of the corporate interest in the policies 
as the sarbanes oxley act may prohibit additional funding by manor care  we committed to reallocate million of our interest in the policy cash surrender values to the various officer policies  upon officer retirement 
this reallocation increased our accrued liability  resulting in a charge of million 
in  we also terminated our split dollar arrangements covering an executive life insurance program and transferred our share of the split dollar life insurance policies to the officers and key employees 
this action resulted in a charge of million  as discussed previously 
the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses primarily related to wages  consulting expenses and other general inflationary costs 
asset impairment 
during our quarterly reviews of long lived assets in  management determined that certain assets were impaired by million 
the impairment consisted of million for long term care facilities  million for non strategic land parcels  million for assets held for sale and million for our vision business 
management assesses quarterly whether any of its long term care facilities are impaired 
we consider indicators of impairment to be either market conditions or negative cash flows 
the various market conditions include the litigation environment  deterioration of the areas in which the facilities are located  deteriorating state government reimbursement  condition of the physical plant and excess bed capacity 
during the spring of  we engaged in a portfolio management review 
our new portfolio management strategy included evaluating as divestiture targets older assets  poor or declining financial performers  geographically isolated facilities with lower per diem revenues  facilities operating in a state with low medicaid reimbursement  and facilities in states with punitive regulatory survey and or an unfavorable litigation climate 
we also looked at alternatives for moving beds from underperforming facilities to locations where demand would fill them or combining assets of locations in the same geography into a single location 
the long term care facilities that were impaired as part of this strategy included seven skilled nursing facilities and three assisted living facilities 
of these  various market conditions were considered  which resulted in the impairment of eight facilities 
these impairments were based on management s judgment and independent real estate broker valuations 
the remaining two facilities had a history of negative cash flows for more than three years 
the results of operations could not be improved even after changing facility management several times 
as of december   we closed one facility  sold six facilities and are currently operating the other three facilities 
the carrying values of the facilities were reduced by million to their estimated fair values of million 
the estimated fair values were determined based on comparable sales 
table of contents values 
the carrying values of land parcels exceeded their estimated fair values by million 
the fair values were based on estimated sales values under current market conditions 
during  we received offers on all of our assisted living facilities that had been held for sale 
the offers  less the cost to sell  were less than our carrying values on of these facilities and required us to write down the asset values by million to their estimated fair values of million 
we sold two of the texas facilities in the fourth quarter of the remaining facilities did not have final purchase agreements at december  and  accordingly  were no longer held for sale 
because the writedown of the assets to fair value was in excess of the depreciation that we would have recorded on these facilities  we did not have to recognize a retroactive depreciation adjustment when the facilities were transferred to property and equipment 
this transfer required us to reverse million of expense previously recorded for estimated selling costs 
we continued to successfully operate these facilities at december  we decided that our vision business was no longer a long term strategy 
because of this decision  our non compete and management contracts were impaired and written down by million 
the fair value of the management contracts was determined based on a discounted cash flow or a multiple of projected earnings 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million from to because of the higher interest rates associated with our fixed rate senior notes issued in april compared with our variable rate credit agreement debt that was paid off 
the increase in interest expense also related to additional amortization of finance fees from the new senior notes 
in addition  we entered into interest rate swap agreements in may on a notional amount of million to hedge certain fixed rate senior notes 
these agreements effectively converted the interest rates of these notes to variable rates in order to provide a better balance of fixed and variable rate debt 
these agreements reduced our interest expense by million in gain on sale of assets 
our gain on the sale of assets in primarily resulted from the sale of non strategic land parcels and sale of securities 
our gain on the sale of assets in primarily related to a million gain recognized on the sale of our hospital 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies 
our equity earnings increased million compared with  primarily because of our ownership interests in two hospitals acquired on april  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that we adopted january  under this statement  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we completed our initial impairment test and 
table of contents determined that million of our goodwill related to our vision business was impaired 
the impairment loss  with no tax effect  was recorded retroactive to january  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
inflation 
we believe that inflation has had no material impact on our results of operations 
financial condition december  and net property and equipment decreased million primarily because of depreciation of million and disposal of assets of million 
these decreases were partially offset by million in new construction and renovations to existing facilities and million to purchase four leased facilities in ohio 
long term debt decreased because we purchased million principal amount of the senior notes due issued by our wholly owned subsidiary and million principal amount of our senior notes due  pursuant to our previously announced cash tender offers 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value 
the pro forma footnote disclosure is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the statement is effective for us beginning july   but early adoption is permitted in periods in which financial statements have not been issued 
there are two transition alternatives  modified prospective and modified retrospective 
under the modified prospective method  we will be required to recognize compensation cost in the financial statements on the date of adoption 
under the modified retrospective method  we will be required to restate prior periods by recognizing in the financial statements the same amount of compensation cost as previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under statement we will be permitted to apply the modified retrospective method either to all periods presented or to the start of the fiscal year in which statement r is adopted 
in addition  statement r requires awards classified as liabilities such as cash settled stock appreciation rights to be measured at fair value at each reporting date versus measured at intrinsic value under statement the time value of the liability will be recognized as compensation cost but then be reversed as the settlement date approaches 
at expiration  total compensation cost will not differ from that which would result under the intrinsic value method 

table of contents management expects to adopt this statement under the modified prospective transition method but has not determined the impact of adoption 
capital resources and liquidity cash flows 
during  we satisfied our cash requirements primarily with cash generated from operating activities 
we used the cash principally for capital expenditures  the purchase of our common stock  the paydown of debt and the payment of dividends 
cash flows from operating activities were million for  an increase of million from the increase in cash flows resulted primarily from an increase in net income 
investing activities 
our expenditures for property and equipment of million in included million to purchase four leased facilities in ohio and million to construct new facilities and expand existing facilities 
the proceeds from the sale of assets primarily related to the sale of facilities  and two of these facilities were leased to others 
debt agreements 
as of december   there were no loans outstanding under our three year million revolving credit facility 
after consideration of usage for letters of credit  there was million available for future borrowings 
during august  we purchased million principal amount of the senior notes due issued by our wholly owned subsidiary and million principal amount of our senior notes due the offers were financed with cash on hand and required a prepayment premium of million 
the holders of our million convertible senior notes have the right to require us to purchase the notes on april  by notifying us between the th and th business day prior to the purchase date 
we are required to pay in cash the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
based on the current market value of the notes  we do not expect any of the holders to require us to purchase their notes 
unless the market value of the convertible senior notes declines approximately percent from its value at december   the holders of the notes would receive less by requiring us to redeem the debt than from selling the notes on the market 
our three year credit agreement requires us to meet certain measurable financial ratio tests  to refrain from certain prohibited transactions such as certain liens  larger than permitted dividends  stock redemptions and asset sales  and to fulfill certain affirmative obligations such as paying taxes when due and maintaining properties and licenses 
we met all covenants at december  none of our debt agreements permit the lenders to determine in their sole discretion that a material adverse change has occurred and either refuse to lend additional funds or accelerate current loans 
our and senior note agreements contain a clause that is triggered if we were to have a change of control that is immediately followed by a downgrade in debt rating by either standard poor s ratings service or moody s investors service  inc if a change of control were followed by a rating agency downgrade  we are obligated to offer to 
table of contents redeem the and senior notes 
as long as we offer to make such redemption  we will have satisfied the conditions of the and senior notes 
both standard poor s ratings service and moody s investors service  inc maintain an investment grade rating for our and senior notes  convertible senior notes and revolving credit facility 
stock purchase 
during and  our board of directors authorized us to spend up to million to purchase our common stock  with million of the authorization expiring on december  and the remaining million on december  with these authorizations  we purchased  shares in for million and had million remaining authority as of december  we may use the shares for internal stock option and k match programs and for other uses  such as possible acquisitions 
cash dividends 
on january   we announced that the company will pay a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share to shareholders of record on february  this dividend will approximate million and is payable february  we intend to declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends  however  there can be no assurance that any dividends will be declared  paid or increased in the future 
contractual obligations 
the following table provides information about our contractual obligations at december  payments due by years after total in thousands debt including interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases internal construction projects deferred acquisition costs total the debt obligation includes the principal payments and interest payments through the maturity date 
for variable rate debt and variable rate payment obligations under our interest rate swap agreements  we have computed our obligation based on the rates in effect at december  until maturity 
for our convertible senior notes  the holders have the right to require us to purchase the notes on april  because we have the ability and intent to finance the purchase with our revolving credit facility  we are including the principal payment and assuming interest is paid through april  maturity date of credit facility 

table of contents the operating lease obligation includes the annual operating lease payments on our corporate headquarters that reflect interest only payments on the lessor s million of underlying debt obligations  as well as a residual guarantee of that amount at the lease maturity in at the maturity of the lease  we will be obligated to either purchase the building by paying the million of underlying debt or vacate the building and cover the difference  if any  between that amount and the then fair market value of the building 
we believe that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover operating needs  future capital expenditure requirements  scheduled debt payments of miscellaneous small borrowing arrangements and capitalized leases  cash dividends and some share repurchase 
because of our significant annual cash flow  we believe that we will be able to refinance the major pieces of our debt as they mature 
it is likely that we will pursue growth from acquisitions  partnerships and other ventures that we would fund from excess cash from operations  credit available under our revolving credit facility and other financing arrangements that are normally available in the marketplace 
commitments and contingencies letters of credit 
we had total letters of credit of million at december  which benefit certain third party insurers  and percent of these letters of credit were related to recorded liabilities 
environmental liabilities 
one or more subsidiaries or affiliates of mca have been identified as potentially responsible parties in a variety of actions relating to waste disposal sites that allegedly are subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation liability act  or cercla  and similar state laws 
cercla imposes retroactive  strict joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties for the costs of hazardous waste clean up 
the actions arise out of the alleged activities of cenco  incorporated and its subsidiary and affiliated companies 
cenco was acquired in by a wholly owned subsidiary of mca 
the actions allege that cenco transported or generated hazardous substances that came to be located at the sites in question 
environmental proceedings may involve owners and or operators of the hazardous waste site  multiple waste generators and multiple waste transportation disposal companies 
these proceedings involve efforts by governmental entities or private parties to allocate or recover site investigation and clean up costs  which costs may be substantial 
we cannot quantify with precision the potential liability exposure for currently pending environmental claims and litigation  without regard to insurance coverage  because of the inherent uncertainties of litigation and because the ultimate cost of the remedial actions for some of the waste disposal sites where mca is alleged to be a potentially responsible party has not yet been determined 
at december   we had million accrued in other long term liabilities based on our current assessment of the likely outcome of the actions  which was reviewed with our outside advisors 
at december   there were no receivables related to insurance recoveries
