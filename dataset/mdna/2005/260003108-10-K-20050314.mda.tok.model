the company experienced strong bookings in the second half of  which boosted its backlog going into critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the public disclosures of the company  including information regarding contingencies  risk and its financial condition 
the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to gaap and are consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the company 
primary areas where the financial information of dover is subject to the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgment include the following areas 
revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following circumstances are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b price is fixed or determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured and d delivery has occurred 
in revenue transactions where installation is required  revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
revenue transactions involving non essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time  at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers 
if the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product  revenues are deferred until installation is complete 
in a limited number of revenue transactions  other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and  accordingly  revenues are deferred until the customer is obligated to pay  or acceptance has been confirmed 
service revenues are recognized and earned when services are performed and are not significant to any period presented 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though dover considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have a material effect on reserve balances required 
in times of rapid market decline  such as affected a number of technologies companies in and  reserve balances need to be adjusted in response to these unusual circumstances 
inventory for the majority of the company s subsidiaries  including all international subsidiaries and the technologies segment  are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
other domestic inventory is stated at cost  determined on the last in  first out lifo basis  which is less than market value 
under certain market conditions  estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the company to properly value inventory 
technologies companies tend to experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations  particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time 
occasionally  the company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting principles 
these reserves  for both severance and exit costs  require the use of estimates 
though dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs  actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 
dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines including sfas no 
for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions  particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value 
dover s assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when there is a significant change in circumstances 
the company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations 
the valuation of dover s pension and other post retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  investment returns  projected salary increases and benefits  and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in dover s pension reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for dover s future pension obligations 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on dover s pension expenses and related funding requirements 
dover s expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns and portfolio allocation 
dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations  changes in tax codes and rulings  changes in statutory tax rates and the company s future taxable income levels 
dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk management program 
these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
the company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions  dover s experience  and relevant industry data 
dover considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and company experience 
dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify dover s ultimate exposure in these matters 
the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that dover is properly reserved 
reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues 
while dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate  future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 
the company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons 
estimates are used to adjust  if necessary  the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale 
the adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold 
changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dispositions  dividends  adequacy of commercial paper and available bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
the company continues to generate substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position  with enough liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a short and long term basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt  interest rate swaps attached thereto  commercial paper borrowings and investments in cash equivalents 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates of the company s weighted average long term debt interest rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the company s long term debt 
commercial paper borrowings are at variable interest rates  and have maturities of three months or less 
a basis point increase or decrease in the interest rates of the company s weighted average commercial paper interest rate on commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
the company places its investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a basis point decrease or increase in interest rates of the company s weighted average interest rate would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax earnings

foreign exchange the company conducts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in canada  europe  brazil  china and other asian countries 
therefore  changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect the company s financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations 
as of december  the company had not established a formal company wide foreign currency hedging program but may  from time to time  for a specific exposure  enter into fair value hedges 
the company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local currency based 
a change of or less in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the company s financial position and cash flows
