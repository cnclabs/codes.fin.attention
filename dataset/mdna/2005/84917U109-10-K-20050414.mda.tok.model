item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors 
overview on august   a wholly owned subsidiary of gart sports company completed a merger with the sports authority  inc  and gart sports company was renamed the sports authority  inc the references made to the entities herein refer to the sports authority  inc formerly gart sports company which includes sports authority or company or we or our or us and its subsidiaries 
tsa refers to tsa stores inc formerly known as the sports authority  inc 
the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting with gart sports company as the acquirer 
accordingly  the results of operations below for fiscal include the results of tsa since the date of the merger 
the combined company is headquartered in englewood  colorado and is listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol tsa 
following the tsa merger  we are one of the nation s largest publicly traded full line sporting goods retailers  with a presence in most major markets across the united states 
at january   we operated stores in states under the sports authority  gart sports  oshman s and sportmart brand names 
we also have a licensing agreement with mega sports co 
ltd  a joint venture between the company and aeon co  ltd  to operate stores in japan under the sports authority name 
with our major financial and retail systems integrated by the end of fiscal  fiscal was dedicated to continued integration of processes and merchandise assortments and improving the effectiveness of the company s supply chain 
to ensure that we get the right merchandise to the right store at the right time  we retrofitted the tsa burlington  new jersey and mcdonough  georgia distribution centers to conform to consistent company wide systems  and also commenced operations in our new  square foot distribution center in fontana  california late in the first quarter 
as of january   we have completed or initiated tsa store remodels since the merger 
in addition  we have completed golf day shops for a total of company wide 
finally  we now have our full service statement shoe walls in over stores company wide 
these statement shoe walls provide a full service environment for higher priced performance footwear 
from a merchandise assortment perspective  we have substantially completed our enhanced product offerings in the fitness category and our expansion of winter sports products into the tsa markets 
we continue to assess our private label programs for the best ways to optimize these programs on a company wide basis 
during fiscal we opened new stores  closed underperforming tsa stores and two smaller format stores and relocated two stores 
our comparable store sales for fiscal decreased 
in fiscal we experienced comparable store sales declines in our team sports  outdoor  fitness and skate categories  which were partially offset by increased sales driven by our remodeled tsa stores and increases in the outdoor apparel and ski categories 
given the economic characteristics of our store formats  the similar nature of the products sold  the type of customer and method of distribution  our operations are aggregated in one reportable segment as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales and the number of stores open at the end of each period dollars rounded to millions fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars dollars dollars net sales    cost of goods sold  buying  distribution and occupancy  gross profit operating expenses merger integration costs pre opening expenses operating income interest expense other income  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income number of stores at end of period we consider cost of goods sold to include the direct cost of merchandise  plus certain costs associated with procurement  warehousing  handling and distribution 
in addition to the full cost of inventory  cost of goods sold includes related store occupancy costs and amortization and depreciation of leasehold improvements and rental equipment 
operating expenses include controllable and non controllable store expenses except occupancy  non store expenses and depreciation and amortization not associated with cost of goods sold 
fiscal as compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to  million in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal of the million increase  million is due to the inclusion of sales from tsa stores acquired in the merger in the first twenty six weeks of fiscal versus results for gart sports on a stand alone basis for the first twenty six weeks of fiscal the remaining increase of million is attributable primarily to sales from new store openings of million  offset by million of sales decreases from store closures and lower comparable store sales 
comparable store sales for fiscal were down 
however  we had positive performance in the outdoor apparel and ski categories primarily due to our expansion of winter sports products into certain tsa markets 
in aggregate  these categories produced a million  or a increase  in comparable store sales 
additionally  we have experienced strong sales trends in our remodeled tsa stores 
offsetting these gains were declines in the fitness  team sports  outdoor and skate categories aggregating million  or a decrease  in comparable store sales 
during the second fiscal quarter of we reassigned responsibilities within the merchandising group  which resulted in some short term disruption in placement and allocation of product orders  which negatively impacted the sales in several categories 
in the third fiscal quarter of  we experienced a decline in comparable store sales partially as a result of the hurricanes that impacted the southeastern united states 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal  or an improvement of basis points 
this improvement was due to an increase in gross profit of basis points as a result of improved merchandise margins resulting primarily from lower inventory costs due to the increased buying power of the combined company and improved shrink performance 
the application of eitf produced an increase in gross profit of million  or basis points  for vendor entitlements recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold which would historically have been treated as a reduction of advertising expense 
these increases in gross profit were partially offset by higher store occupancy and distribution center costs as a percent of sales 
operating expenses 
operating expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal these increases are primarily due to the operating costs associated with the acquired tsa stores and as a result of the application of eitf which resulted in the additional recharacterization of million  or of net sales  in vendor entitlements from a reduction of advertising expense to a reduction of cost of inventory purchased in additionally  operating expenses increased as a percentage of sales due to the decrease in comparable store sales 
merger integration costs 
merger integration costs for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal integration costs include only non recurring  incremental costs arising as a direct result of integrating the two companies following the tsa merger 
for fiscal  these costs consisted primarily of million of severance  recruitment fees and duplicative payroll and benefits  million for consulting fees related to integrating the two companies  million in relocation and travel expenses  million related to closing the operations of the former tsa corporate office and closure of a gart distribution center  and million in advertising expense related to rebranding 
for fiscal  these costs consisted of million of duplicative payroll  benefits and retention payments  million of severance costs  million of consulting fees  million of expense related to closing the operations of the former tsa corporate office in ft 
lauderdale and closing a gart store in an overlapping market  million for relocation and travel  and million of advertising related to rebranding and announcing the combined company 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses in fiscal were million or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal pre opening expenses in fiscal were for the addition of new stores and two relocations compared to new stores and three relocations in fiscal operating income 
as a result of the factors described above  operating income for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense is primarily related to increased debt levels due to the assumption of tsa debt upon completion of the merger  funding of merger and integration costs  and financing increased inventory levels due to the replacement of tsa inventory identified as clearance and non go forward at the time of the merger  negative comparable store sales  and our investment in the remodeling of acquired tsa stores 
we also paid interest at higher rates in fiscal versus the prior year as a result of higher day libor rates 
other income 
other income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the prior year included million in interest income associated with the settlement of a tax dispute involving gart s former parent 
income taxes 
our income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the prior year included a tax benefit of million related to the settlement of the tax dispute discussed above 
this one time benefit had the effect of reducing the effective tax rate  which would otherwise have been approximately  compared to approximately for fiscal fiscal as compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to  million in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal the sales increase reflects the inclusion of million in sales from tsa stores from august   the merger date  versus results for gart sports on a stand alone basis in fiscal additionally  non comparable sales for gart on a stand alone basis increased million  net  reflecting an increase from store openings in fiscal and fiscal of million  offset by a decrease of million  primarily from store closings 
comparable store sales in fiscal  which includes tsa stores since august   decreased  primarily due to a first quarter decline of for gart on a stand alone basis 
the first quarter was impacted by a comparison to increased sales from the salt lake city winter olympics in and a decrease in sales due to a major snowstorm in the denver area in  among other factors 
sales performance improved thereafter  with relatively flat comparable store sales in the second and fourth quarters  and a increase in the third quarter 
focusing on results for the company following the tsa merger  comparable store sales increased million or for the last half of the fiscal year 
the increase resulted from a positive performance in the team sports  hunting and camping categories  and by strong sales in the ski  snowboard and snow apparel categories in sports authority locations in the northeast 
the northeast stores benefited from an expanded product offering in these categories  as the broader assortment available in gart stores was introduced into sports authority cold weather markets 
in aggregate  these factors produced a million or increase in comparable store sales 
partially offsetting these gains were declines in the fitness equipment  trends gifts and skate categories aggregating million or decrease in comparable store sales 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase as a percent of net sales reflected improved merchandise margins for the combined companies as a result of lower inventory costs 
gart sports results also improved on a stand alone basis over the prior year  with an increase in merchandise margins of of net sales 
the increase reflects a somewhat less promotional selling environment in fiscal than in the prior year combined with reduced inventory costs  which produced improvements in merchandise margin rates in a number of categories 
these categories include fitness equipment  snowboards  hunting and camping  which produced a combined increase in merchandise margin rates of basis points 
in addition  the application of eitf consensus no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf resulted in the recharacterization of million of vendor allowances  from a reduction of advertising expense to a reduction of the cost of inventory purchased  of which million  or of net sales  was recognized in cost of goods sold in fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in operating expense dollars primarily reflects the store operating costs associated with tsa stores acquired on august  operating expenses also increased as a percent of sales due to the following factors i tsa stores overall operating expenses historically trended higher than gart s 
tsa stores selling  general and administrative expenses were  and of net sales in  an  compared to gart s operating expenses of of net sales for each of fiscal and  and of net sales for fiscal the implementation of consistent operating procedures for the combined company is an ongoing process that we expect to have completed by the end of fiscal ii the higher level of general and administrative costs as a result of the tsa merger  including insurance costs  which increased million  and corporate office rent  which increased million due to additional leased office space to accommodate our larger corporate offices  iii the recharacterization of million  or of net sales  of cooperative advertising monies from a reduction of advertising expense to a reduction of inventory costs as required by eitf  and iv establishing a reserve for the settlement of wage and hour class action lawsuits in california totaling million  including attorney fees and expenses  recorded in the first quarter of merger integration costs 
merger integration costs for fiscal were million  or of net sales  and were related to the tsa merger 
integration costs include only non recurring  incremental costs arising as a direct result of integrating the two companies following the merger 
for fiscal  these costs consisted of million of duplicative payroll  benefits and retention payments  million of severance costs  million of consulting fees  million of expense related to closing the operations of the tsa corporate office in ft 
lauderdale and closing a gart store in an overlapping market  million for relocation and travel  and million of advertising related to rebranding and announcing the combined company 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal pre opening expenses in fiscal were for the addition of new stores and three relocations compared to eight new stores and one relocation in fiscal operating income 
as a result of the factors described above  operating income for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense is related to the assumption of tsa stores debt upon completion of the merger and to financing of merger and integration costs 
other income 
other income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to interest income associated with the settlement of the rite aid tax dispute totaling million 
income taxes 
our income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal tax expense for fiscal was offset by a tax benefit of million recorded as a result of the settlement with our former parent regarding an irs examination of our and consolidated federal income tax returns 
excluding this one time benefit  the company s estimated tax rate was approximately for both fiscal and fiscal liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for inventory and other seasonal working capital needs  capital improvements  including investments in store remodeling  store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements  and pre opening expenses to support our expansion plans 
cash flow analysis the following table presents changes in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands  except ratios cash provided by operating activities    cash used in investing activities    cash provided by used in financing activities   capital expenditures long term debt at end of period    working capital at end of period    long term debt to equity ratio at end of period cash provided by operating activities increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization increased by million which was offset by an increase in cash used for inventories net of accounts payable of million 
additionally  cash used for accounts receivable decreased by million and cash used for accrued expenses decreased by million resulting in an increase in operating cash flows compared to fiscal in fiscal  the increase in cash provided by operations compared to fiscal is primarily due to a higher level of accounts payable financing in fiscal  only partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventories 
cash used in investing activities decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the change reflects an increase in cash received from the sale of property and equipment and mortgage notes of million and the absence of any direct merger costs which totaled million in fiscal  offset by an increase in capital expenditures in fiscal of million 
total capital expenditures in were million  excluding million of tenant improvement allowances received from landlords classified as operating cash flows 
the net of these amounts is million in fiscal which was used to fund various capital improvements  including million for store remodels and new fixtures  million for new store openings and two relocations  million for installation of golf day departments  statement shoe walls  and miscellaneous store improvements  million for distribution center capital spending  and million for information systems upgrades 
cash used in financing activities  which typically consists principally of net borrowings or payments under our revolving credit facility  decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease reflects net borrowings of million in fiscal which were used to finance the tsa merger compared to net paydowns of million in fiscal our liquidity and capital needs have principally been met by operating cash flows and by borrowings under a revolving credit facility with cit business credit  inc cit  as agent 
under our credit financing agreement the credit agreement the company may borrow up to  generally limited to an amount equal to of eligible inventory or of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory as defined in the agreement  but with seasonal increases in the advance rate permitted 
interest on the revolving credit facility is payable monthly at chase manhattan bank s prime rate plus a margin rate ranging from to or  at our option  at chase manhattan bank s libor rate plus a margin rate ranging from to 
on september   the company entered into an amended and restated financing agreement with cit that modified the terms of the credit facility by providing for an additional million term loan and extending the maturity date of our existing revolving credit line to august  the term loan was drawn in full on september  and is due on september  unless it is extended to august  at our option upon notice given no earlier than days  and no later than days  prior to september   as long as no default has then occurred and is continuing under the credit agreement and if certain ebitda and fixed charge coverage ratio minimums  as defined in the credit agreement  are met 
interest on the term loan is payable monthly at chase manhattan bank s prime rate plus or  at the option of the company  at chase manhattan bank s libor rate plus a margin rate ranging from to 
the company paid one time fees of approximately million in fiscal to secure the amended and restated financing agreement  and is amortizing that amount over the life of the agreement on the effective interest method 
at january   borrowings under the credit facility were million and million was available for borrowing 
on april   the company entered into amendment one to the amended and restated financing agreement 
this amendment extends the maturity date of the revolving credit line to august  and modifies the method of calculating the margin spread above the applicable interest rates available to us 
the pricing grids for both the term loan and the revolving credit line in the loan agreement were also modified to allow us to earn a lower spread if certain financial targets are achieved which is more favorable than the spread in the amended and restated financing agreements 
interest on the revolving credit line is payable monthly at chase manhattan bank s prime rate or  at our option  at chase manhattan bank s libor rate plus a margin rate ranging from to 
interest on the term loan is payable monthly at chase manhattan bank s prime rate plus a margin rate ranging from to or  at the option of the company  at chase manhattan bank s libor rate plus a margin rate ranging from to 
the company paid one time fees of approximately  to secure amendment one to the amended and restated financing agreement capital expenditures  net of tenant improvement allowances  are projected to be approximately to million in fiscal  primarily for the opening of approximately new or relocating stores  remodeling of approximately stores  principally sports authority stores  and information systems upgrades and enhancements 
we lease the majority of our store locations and intend to continue to finance our new store construction with long term operating leases 
based upon recent store openings  newly constructed stores require a cash investment  net of tenant improvement allowances received from landlords  of approximately million for a  square foot store and approximately million for a  square foot store 
we believe that cash generated from operations  combined with funds available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures  future common share purchases  if any  and other working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we intend to utilize the revolving credit facility to meet seasonal fluctuations in cash flow requirements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments in effect at january  dollars in thousands payments due by period total within year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases  net     total contractual cash obligations    amount of commitment expiration per period total within year years years after years in thousands other commercial commitments purchase commitments   import letters of credit standby letters of credit    total commercial commitments    we have routine commitments under merchandise inventory purchase orders  which vary in amount from month to month depending on seasonality and other factors 
such purchase orders are cancelable by us without payment 
in addition  we have entered into employment agreements with certain employees  primarily those at the vice president level and above 
payments under these employment agreements are dependent on these employees providing future services and certain payments are required to be made upon termination of employment by us without cause  as defined in the employment agreements 
these items have not been included in the amounts in the above table 
these amounts include future minimum rent payments  net of million of non cancelable sublease payments  and exclude the associated operating costs of our operating leases 
in addition to minimum rent payments  our leases typically provide for the payment of associated operating costs  primarily common area maintenance  insurance and real estate taxes 
for the year ended january  these associated operating costs for our leases were approximately million 
interest rate and foreign currency risk management we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on december   expiring on may   and entered into a second interest rate swap agreement on june   expiring on june   to minimize the risks and costs associated with our financing activities 
under the swap agreements  we pay fixed rate interest and receive variable libor interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreements 
the total notional amounts under the interest rate swaps are million  which do not represent the exposure due to credit loss 
our interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and are considered highly effective  as defined by fasb statement no 
net settlements on the swap agreements are recorded as interest expense 
at january   the fair value of the swap agreements was a loss of  net of the related tax benefit 
the unrealized loss from these interest rate swaps is included in other comprehensive income and is a component of stockholders equity 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is not material 
on april  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement effective june  and expiring may  with a notional amount of million 
under the swap agreement  we pay fixed rate interest and receive variable libor interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreement 
seasonality and inflation the following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in fiscal and this information is unaudited  but is prepared on the same basis as the annual financial information and  in the opinion of management  reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
the results for the first two quarters of fiscal year are not comparable to the other periods presented due to the exclusion of the sports authority results of operations  prior to august   the date of merger 
fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter dollars in millions net sales of full year net sales operating income fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter dollars in millions net sales of full year net sales operating income loss amounts reflect the results of gart sports on a stand alone basis for these periods 
amounts include the results of the former sports authority  inc from august   the date of merger 
the fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter 
we believe that two primary factors contribute to this seasonality first  sales of cold weather sporting goods and ski and snowboard merchandise during the fourth quarter are generally strong in anticipation of the ski and snowboard season  and second  holiday sales contribute significantly to our operating results 
as a result of these factors  inventory levels  which gradually increase beginning in april  generally reach their peak in november and then decline to their lowest level following the december holiday season 
any decrease in sales for the fourth quarter  whether due to a slow holiday selling season  poor snowfall in ski areas near our markets or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year 
although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that inflation has a material impact on our results of operations 
we believe that we are generally able to pass along inflationary increases in costs to our customers 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  vendor allowances  the recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets  store closing reserves  income taxes  self insured reserves and the estimates used to apply the purchase method of accounting to our mergers and acquisitions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies 
valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market 
cost is determined using the average cost of items purchased and applying the dollar value lifo inventory method 
our dollar value lifo pools are computed using the inventory price index computation ipic method 
lifo cost of our inventories is then compared to estimated market value 
this assessment of estimated market value is based on the quality and age of merchandise  the rate of sale of merchandise  the quantities on hand  and our assessment of the market conditions 
estimates and judgments are required in the determination of the market value of our inventory and future events  such as changes in customer merchandise preferences or unseasonable weather patterns  could impact the market value of our inventory 
inventory shrinkage is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical inventory shrinkage trends 
we perform physical inventories at stores and distribution centers throughout the year 
the reserve for inventory shrinkage represents an estimate for inventory shrinkage for each location since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date 
these estimates are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary from actual results 
vendor allowances we receive certain allowances from our vendors  which include rebates and cooperative advertising funds 
these amounts are negotiated with vendors typically on an annual basis and are  at times  dependent on projected purchase volumes and advertising plans 
the amounts are subject to changes in market conditions or marketing strategies of our vendors  and changes in our product purchases 
we record an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest information available with respect to purchase volumes  advertising plans and status of our negotiation with vendors 
impairment of assets we review long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value of long lived tangible and intangible assets is impaired 
store closing reserves prior to december  and the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 we recorded a provision for store closing costs when the decision was made by management to close a store 
in accordance with sfas no 
 for store closing activities initiated after december   the related liability is recorded at fair value when a liability is incurred rather than when the decision to close a store is made 
this will change the timing of recognition for certain exit costs  so that certain exit costs will be recognized over the period in which the exit activities occur 
we also record store exit reserves arising from our various mergers and acquisitions pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations and eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination eitf 
under eitf  the costs of a plan to exit an activity of the acquired company are recognized as liabilities assumed in the business combination 
as such  reserves are recorded in purchase accounting for the net present value of projected costs to be incurred after the store closing date 
the costs incurred in connection with store closings primarily consist of post closing future net lease obligations  utilities  property taxes  and employee costs directly related to the store closing 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability based on projections of future operating results  which dictate our ability to realize the tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets when this amount exceeds the amount more likely than not to be realized 
as of january   we had no valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
self insured reserves we are self insured for our workers compensation  general liability and employee medical plans up to a self insured retention amount 
we record a reserve for the estimated cost of both reported and incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
the estimate of our current claim obligation requires significant judgment and is based on specific loss estimates for reported claims  and on loss triangulation estimates of future claims payments  including ibnr s 
reserves are regularly evaluated for adequacy based on the most current available information  including historical claims experience and expected future claims costs 
acquisitions and mergers accounting our acquisitions and mergers are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the total costs of such transactions are allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
the determination of fair values involves the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to adjustment in the future 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate  and will not require adjustment in future periods 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

sfas no 
clarifies that inventory costs that are abnormal are required to be charged to expense as incurred as opposed to being capitalized into inventory as a product cost 
sfas no 
provides examples of abnormal costs to include costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage 
sfas no 
is effective for the fiscal year beginning after june  while we continue to evaluate the impact of sfas no 
 we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the equity instruments 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
under the provisions of this statement  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition alternatives include retrospective and prospective adoption methods 
under the retrospective method  prior periods may be restated based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures see note q either for all periods presented or as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recognized beginning with the effective date for all share based payments granted after the effective date  and for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of this statement that remain unvested on the effective date 
the provisions of this statement are effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we are currently evaluating the requirements of this revision and have not determined its method of adoption 
risks and uncertainties intense competition in the sporting goods industry could limit our growth and reduce our profitability 
the sporting goods retail market is highly fragmented and intensely competitive 
our current and prospective competitors include many large companies that have substantially greater market presence  name recognition  financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we compete directly or indirectly with the following categories of companies large format full line sporting goods retailers  traditional sporting goods stores and chains  specialty sporting goods retailers and pro shops  mass merchandisers  warehouse clubs  discount stores and department stores  and catalog and internet based sporting goods retailers 
increased competition in markets in which we have stores  the adoption by competitors of innovative store formats  pricing strategies and retail sale methods  the entry of new competitors in our markets or the expansion of operations by existing competitors in our markets could cause us to lose market share  limit our growth and reduce our profitability 
if we are unable to predict or react to changes in consumer demand  our sales may decline and we may be required to take significant markdowns in inventory 
our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods 
our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change 
additionally  we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors several months in advance of the proposed delivery 
if we misjudge the market for our merchandise  we may lose sales or we may overstock unpopular products  which may require us to take significant inventory markdowns 
in either case  our revenues and profit margins could significantly decline and our business and financial results may suffer 
we sell products that expose us to a greater risk of product liability and infringement claims  and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims 
additionally  we face claims in illinois relating to the sale of handguns before we may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that we sell or rent 
among other things  we sell long guns  handguns and air pistols  which are products that are associated with an increased risk of injury and related lawsuits 
we may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense of these claims 
we may also incur losses due to lawsuits relating to our performance of background checks on firearm purchasers as mandated by state and federal law or the improper use of firearms sold by us  including lawsuits by municipalities or other organizations attempting to recover costs from firearm manufacturers and retailers relating to the misuse of firearms 
in addition  in the future there may be increased federal  state or local regulation  including taxation  of the sale of firearms in our current markets as well as future markets in which we may operate 
commencement of these lawsuits against us or the establishment of new regulations could reduce our sales and decrease our profitability 
tsa stores is one of thirty three named defendants  including firearms manufacturers  distributors and retailers  in city of chicago and county of cook v 
beretta usa corp 
et al  circuit court of cook county  illinois 
this suit was served on tsa stores in november the original complaint was based on legal theories of public nuisance and negligent entrustment of firearms and alleged that the defendants created a public nuisance by distributing  marketing and selling firearms in the portion of cook county outside chicago knowing or recklessly disregarding that these guns would be illegally transferred and used in chicago to commit crimes

in february  the court dismissed the complaint s negligent entrustment count 
the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with the court s permission in march  which contained both the public nuisance and negligent entrustment counts 
in september  the court granted the motions of the defendants to dismiss the amended complaint  in its entirety  with prejudice 
in october  the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of their public nuisance claim to the appellate court of illinois  first judicial district 
on november   the appellate court reversed the dismissal of the public nuisance claim and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings 
while the other defendants filed a petition for leave to appeal before the illinois supreme court  tsa stores filed a petition for rehearing with the appellate court on november  the appellate court denied this motion on march  on march   tsa stores filed an additional petition  as the other defendants had done previously  for leave to appeal to the illinois supreme court 
on may   the illinois supreme court granted the plaintiffs subsequent motion to hold the tsa stores s petition in abeyance  pending resolution of the other defendants appeal 
on september   the illinois supreme court heard oral arguments on the other defendants appeal  and on november   issued an opinion reversing the appellate court s decision and affirming the trial court s dismissal of the case 
on january   the illinois supreme court denied the plaintiffs petition for rehearing 
on january   the illinois supreme court exercised its supervisory authority to reverse the appellate court and affirmed the judgment of the trial court 
the time period for the plaintiffs to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court has not run so we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this case 
there is a risk that claims or liabilities with respect to lawsuits will exceed our insurance coverage 
additionally  we may be unable to purchase adequate liability insurance in the future 
although we have entered into product and infringement liability indemnity agreements with many of our vendors  we cannot assure you that we will be able to collect payments sufficient to offset product liability losses 
furthermore  we are subject to regulation by the consumer product safety commission and similar state regulatory agencies 
if we fail to comply with government and industry safety standards  we may be subject to claims  lawsuits  fines and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if our suppliers and distributors do not provide us with sufficient quantities of products  or if conditions in any of the foreign countries where they source merchandise adversely change  we may not be able to offer competitively priced merchandise or the quantities or assortment that our customers demand 
we purchase merchandise from over  vendors 
in fiscal  purchases from nike represented approximately of our total purchases 
although purchases from no other vendor represented more than of our total purchases  our dependence on our principal suppliers involves risk 
we do not have long term agreements with our suppliers and cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our relationships with them 
if there is a disruption in supply from a principal supplier or distributor  we may be unable to obtain the merchandise that we desire to sell and that consumers desire to purchase 
moreover  many of our suppliers provide us with incentives  such as return privileges  volume purchasing discounts  rebates and cooperative advertising allowances 
a decline or discontinuation of these incentives could reduce our profits 
we believe that a significant portion of the products that we purchase  including those purchased from domestic suppliers  is manufactured abroad in countries such as china  taiwan and south korea 
in addition  we believe much of our private label merchandise is manufactured abroad 
foreign imports subject us to the risks of changes in import duties  quotas  loss of most favored nation or mfn status with the united states for a particular foreign country  work stoppages  delays in shipment  freight cost increases and economic uncertainties including the united states imposing antidumping or countervailing duty orders  safeguards  remedies or compensation and retaliation due to illegal foreign trade practices 
if any of these or other factors were to cause a disruption of trade from the countries in which the suppliers of our vendors are located  our inventory levels may be reduced or the cost of our products may increase 
in addition  to the extent that any foreign manufacturers from whom we purchase products directly or indirectly utilize labor and other practices that vary from those commonly accepted in the united states  we could be hurt by any resulting negative publicity or  in come cases  face potential liability 
to date  we have not experienced any difficulties of this nature 
historically  instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which our vendors or we obtain our products has not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
however  we cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in such foreign countries may have on our operations 
in the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries  such disruptions or delays could adversely affect our results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made 
in addition  merchandise purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the merchandise we currently purchase abroad 
countries from which our vendors obtain these new products may  from time to time  impose new or adjust prevailing quotas or other restrictions on exported products  and the united states may impose new duties  quotas and other restrictions on imported products 
the united states congress periodically considers other restrictions on the importation of products obtained by our vendors and us 
the cost of such products may increase for us if applicable duties are raised  or import quotas with respect to such products are imposed or made more restrictive 
our comparable store sales will fluctuate and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance 
changes in our comparable store sales results could affect the price of our common stock 
a number of factors have historically affected  and will continue to affect  our comparable store sales results  including competition  our new store openings and remodeling  general regional and national economic conditions  actions taken by our competitors  consumer trends and preferences  changes in the other tenants in the shopping centers in which we are located  new product introductions and changes in our product mix  timing and effectiveness of promotional events  lack of new product introductions to spur growth in the sale of various kinds of sports equipment  and weather 
our comparable store sales may vary from quarter to quarter  and an unanticipated decline in revenues or comparable store sales may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
our business is seasonal  and our annual results are highly dependent on the success of our holiday selling season 
our business is highly seasonal in nature 
our highest sales and operating profitability historically occur during the fourth fiscal quarter  which is due  in part  to the holiday selling season and  in part  to our strong sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel 
any decrease in our fourth quarter sales  whether because of a slow holiday selling season  poor snowfall in ski areas near our markets  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year 
a downturn in the economy could significantly reduce our revenues 
sales of sporting goods historically depend on consumers discretionary spending 
an economic downturn in any of our major markets  or in general  could reduce consumer spending on discretionary items that could adversely impact our revenues and cause our business and financial results to suffer 
general economic conditions and other factors that affect discretionary spending are beyond our control and are affected by the impact of an economic recession  unemployment trends  interest rates and inflation  consumer and commercial credit availability  consumer debt levels  geopolitical uncertainty  tax rates and tax policy  the impact of natural disasters  and other factors that influence consumer confidence and spending 
increasing volatility in financial markets may cause the above factors to change with an even greater degree of frequency and magnitude 
we have a significant amount of debt that could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 
we entered into a credit facility at the completion of the tsa merger that provides for loans of up to million 
as of january   we had approximately million of long term debt outstanding 
this debt could have significant adverse effects on our business 
this debt makes it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of our debt and the interest on our debt  limits our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities  and makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future  we may have to refinance all or a portion of our debt and or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms could be obtained or that we will be able to operate at a profit 
additionally  the credit facility entered into upon consummation of the merger imposes operating and financial restrictions that may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to grow our business 
our business depends on our ability to satisfy our labor needs 
many of our employees are in entry level or part time positions that historically have high rates of turnover 
we may be unable to satisfy our labor needs and control our costs due to external factors such as unemployment levels  minimum wage legislation and wage inflation 
if general economic conditions improve  it may be more difficult to attract and retain quality employees 
as a result  our business may suffer 
terrorist attacks or acts of war may seriously harm our business 
terrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees  facilities  information systems  vendors and customers  which could significantly impact our net sales  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the threat of terrorist attacks in the united states since september  continues to create many economic and political uncertainties 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause our business to suffer in ways that we currently cannot predict 
the military action taken by the united states and its allies against the government of iraq could have a short or long term negative economic impact upon the financial markets and our business in general 
additionally  events such as those referred to above could cause or contribute to a general decline in equity valuations  which in turn could reduce the market value of your investment in us 
anti takeover provisions may prevent stockholders from realizing a premium return 
anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter unfriendly offers or other efforts to obtain control over us 
these anti takeover provisions  among other things allow our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval  and establish the rights  including voting rights  preferences and limitations of the preferred stock  establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to the board of directors or for stockholder proxy proposals  permit the board of directors to increase its own size and fill the resulting vacancies through a majority vote of directors  even if less than a quorum  and require that mergers and other business combinations with certain interested stockholders  including any holder of or more of our common stock  be approved by a supermajority of the holders of our common stock that are not interested in the transaction 
section of the delaware general corporate law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our common stock 
these measures could make us less attractive to a potential acquirer and deprive stockholders of the opportunity to sell their common stock at a premium price 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate substantially  which may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock  particularly if our quarterly results fall below the expectations of securities analysts 
our sales and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future 
these fluctuations may adversely affect our business  financial condition and the market price of our common stock  particularly if our quarterly results fall below the expectations of securities analysts 
a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  may cause variations in our quarterly net sales and operating results  including changes in consumer demand for the products that we offer in our stores  lockouts or strikes involving professional sports teams  adverse weather conditions  pre opening costs associated with new stores  costs related to the closures of existing stores  litigation  changes in merchandise mix  pricing and promotional events sponsored by our competitors  and general economic conditions 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and may remain volatile in the future 
the value of our common stock may decline as a result of this volatility 
the market price of our common stock has been in the past  and may in the future be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as fluctuations in quarterly operating results  announcements  by us or our competitors  of actual or expected financial results  significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions and trends in the sporting goods industry  and general conditions in the economy or the financial markets 
additionally  in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the performance or condition of particular companies 
such broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company 
if we become subject to this kind of litigation in the future  it could result in substantial litigation costs  damages awards against us and the diversion of our management s attention and resources 
the loss of key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future success depends on the continued services of our senior management  particularly john douglas morton  our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president 
any loss or interruption of the services of our senior management could significantly reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations and implement our key initiatives because we may not be able to find appropriate replacements for our senior management should the need arise 
if we were to lose any key senior management  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we rely on our information systems to operate our business  and if our information systems fail to adequately perform these functions  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on the successful integration and operation of our information systems 
in particular  we rely on our information systems to manage effectively our sales  warehousing  distribution  merchandise planning and replenishment and to optimize our overall inventory levels 
most of our information systems are centrally located at our headquarters  with offsite backup at other locations 
following the tsa merger  we continue to focus on enhancements to the warehouse management systems and store point of sale systems 
systems enhancement issues are complex  time consuming and expensive 
their failure to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business  lead to unanticipated costs  adversely affect our revenues and cause our business and financial results to suffer 
a disruption in the operation of our distribution centers would affect our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores  which could impact adversely our revenues and harm our business and financial results 
most of our merchandise is shipped by our vendors to a limited number of distribution centers 
our distribution centers receive and allocate merchandise to our stores 
events such as fire or other catastrophic events  any malfunction or disruption of our centralized information systems or shipping problems may result in delays or disruptions in the timely distribution of merchandise to our stores  which could adversely impact our revenues and our business and financial results 
lack of available retail store sites on terms acceptable to us  rising real estate prices and other costs and risks relating to new store openings could severely limit our growth opportunities 
our strategy includes opening stores in new and existing markets 
we must successfully choose store sites  execute favorable real estate transactions on terms that are acceptable to us  hire competent personnel and effectively open and operate these new stores 
our plans to increase the number of our retail stores will depend in part on the availability of existing retail stores or store sites 
we may not have stores or sites available to us for purchase or lease  or available on terms acceptable to us 
if additional retail store sites are unavailable on acceptable terms  we may not be able to carry out a significant part of our growth strategy 
rising real estate costs and acquisition  construction and development costs could also inhibit our ability to grow 
if we fail to locate desirable sites  obtain lease rights to these sites on terms acceptable to us  hire adequate personnel and open and effectively operate these new stores  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
we may from time to time acquire complementary companies or businesses 
acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies  and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management s attention from other business issues and opportunities 
we may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire  including their personnel  financial systems  distribution  operations and general store operating procedures 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions  our business could suffer 
in addition  the integration of any acquired business  and their financial results  into ours may adversely affect our operating results 
we currently do not have any agreements with respect to any such acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary interest rate risk exposure results from our long term debt agreement 
our long term debt bears interest at variable rates that are tied to either the us prime rate or libor at the time of the borrowing 
we maintain portions of our debt in libor traunches that mature in one to nine months 
as those traunches mature  the interest rates on our outstanding borrowings are changed to reflect current prime or libor rates 
therefore  our interest expense changes as the prime or libor market rates change 
we have entered into two interest rate swap instruments  designated as cash flow hedges  as shown in the following table date entered into rate paid rate received notional amount fair value at december  mo 
us libor   june  mo 
us libor   based on our overall interest rate exposure at january   a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to borrowings under our revolving credit facility would change our after tax earnings by approximately million over a month period prior to considering the effects of our interest rate swaps 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is limited because we do not operate any stores outside of the united states 
we do not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency exchange to be material 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on us during the quarter or year to date periods in fiscal  or
