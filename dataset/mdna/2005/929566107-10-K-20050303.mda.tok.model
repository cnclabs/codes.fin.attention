item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our capital resources and liquidity as of december  our discussion begins with our assessment of the condition of the north american trailer industry along with a summary of the actions we have taken to reposition wabash 
we then analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business and our operations segments  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity  capital markets events and transactions  our new credit facility  and contractual commitments 
we then provide a review of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made which we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
these are the critical accounting policies that affect the recognition and measurement of our transactions and the balances in our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recent accounting pronouncements which we adopted during the year  as well as those not yet adopted that are expected to have an impact on our financial accounting practices 
we have two reportable segments manufacturing and retail and distribution 
the manufacturing segment produces trailers that are sold to customers who purchase trailers directly or through independent dealers and to the retail and distribution segment 
the retail and distribution segment includes the sale of new and used trailers  as well as the sale of aftermarket parts and service through its retail branch network 
executive summary the year marks the second year of recovery for the industry after a three year downturn 
during this period  we repositioned wabash by focusing on the continuous improvement of our manufacturing and retail operations  expanding our customer base  introducing products that better address customers needs  exiting non core operations and strengthening our capital structure 
we believe wabash is positioned to fully participate in the market growth that analysts are predicting will continue into and beyond 
operating performance we measure our operating performance in four key areas safety  quality  productivity and cost reduction 
our objective  be better tomorrow than we are today  is simple  straightforward and easily understood by all our associates 
safety 
we have achieved a four fold improvement in the total recordable incident rate since june  and our safety metrics have improved each quarter for straight quarters 
we believe improved safety translates into higher labor productivity and lower costs as a result of less time missed due to injuries 
quality 
we measure our quality performance in terms of first pass yield how many units pass all inspection criteria without requiring rework our first pass yield metrics have improved from in to during warranty we measure  among other things  the number and severity of warranty claims 
while improvements are being noted and we are encouraged by the results  a longer term perspective is required before declaring success 
productivity 
we measure productivity on many fronts 
some key indicators include production line speed  man hours per trailer and inventory levels 
improvements in these areas translate into increased available capacity  which we estimated to be over  units annually based on a three shift  five day work week 
effective management of inventory has resulted in inventory turns of currently turns per year compared to approximately six turns in cost reduction 
during  we introduced our continuous improvement initiative ci 
as of december  we believe ci has become a way of life 
since introduction  over ci events have been completed 
as a result of our focus in these areas  we received the us senate productivity award for the state of indiana for the significant cost savings and productivity we achieved in the prior two years 
industry trends freight transportation in the united states  according to the american trucking association ata  was estimated to be a billion industry in the latest such information is available 
ata estimates that approximately of all freight tonnage is carried by trucks at some point during its shipment  accounting for approximately of freight industry revenue in the united states 
trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported 
to monitor the state of the industry  we evaluate a number of indicators related to trailer manufacturing and the transportation industry 
information is obtained from sources such as act research co  llc act  ata  cass logistics  and eno transportation foundation 
recent trends we have observed include the following improvement in the number of units shipped 
after reaching a high of approximately  units shipped in  shipments by the us trailer industry declined to approximately  units in each of and unit shipments improved to approximately  units in and were approximately  in act estimates that shipments will be approximately  units 
our view is that shipments will be approximately to lower than the act forecast due to the impact of raw material costs on trailer prices and tractor purchases in advance of new emission regulations 
increasing age of truckload motor carrier trailer fleets 
during the three year period ending december   the latest such information is available the average age of trailer fleets increased from approximately months to months 
we believe this increase resulted in part from deferred purchases by many motor carriers 
this trend suggests to us that there may be pent up replacement demand for trailers 
increasing rate of new trailer orders 
quarterly industry order placements were in the range of  units to  units per month during each of the six quarters ended december  during  the total trailer quarterly average order rates ranged from  to  units 
the fourth quarter of order rate average of  units was the strongest quarterly average order rate since other developments 
other developments and our view of their potential impact on the industry include new federal emission standards that come into effect in could result in improved demand for trailers in and part of  as motor carriers may focus their capital spending on tractors in advance of the regulations taking effect 
a similar pattern occurred in advance of the october enactment of new emission standards 
technology advances in trailer tracking and route management implemented by motor carriers have increased trailer utilization and lowered trailer to tractor ratios and could result in trailer demand 
new federal hours of service rules became effective in january we initially believed that these rules would negatively impact driver productivity and that this could result in increased demand for trailers 
as a result of court intervention  on september   president bush signed the surface transportation extension act of  allowing these regulations to remain in effect until the earlier of a new regulation that resolves court raised issues or september  to date  we believe that there has been a limited amount of increased business as a result of the regulation 
if the regulation is permanently suspended  there is the potential for cancellation of refrigerated units and some increase of trade ins that could affect used trailer prices 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales loss on asset impairment gross profit general and administrative expense selling expense restructuring charge income loss from operations interest expense foreign exchange gains and losses  net loss on debt extinguishment other  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss compared to net sales net sales in increased million compared to the period 
the year included million of sales associated with our rental and leasing and aftermarket parts distribution businesses asset sales 
by business segment  net sales to external customers and related units sold were as follows in millions year ended december  change net sales by segment manufacturing retail and distribution total  new trailer units manufacturing   retail and distribution   total   used trailer units   improving conditions in both the overall economy and the transportation industry coupled with the expansion of our customer base  drove a increase in unit volume in the manufacturing segment 
in response to significant increases in raw material prices  we increased our average selling price throughout the year 
in the fourth quarter of  our average selling price increased approximately compared to the period with the full year increase being approximately 
the sales in the retail and distribution segment were lower than the prior year period  which included million of sales associated with the aforementioned assets sales 
a million increase in new trailer sales caused by a increase in units was partially offset by reductions in used trailer sales 
the decrease in used trailer sales resulted from constrained used equipment availability  as transportation companies retain equipment to meet requirements 
branch parts and services sales were up approximately despite closing four full service locations in and one during gross profit gross profit as a percent of sales was in compared to in  which included a million asset impairment charge taken on certain assets of our rental and leasing and aftermarket parts assets 
as discussed below  both of our segments contributed as follows in millions years ended december  change gross profit loss by segment manufacturing retail and distribution eliminations total gross profit the manufacturing segment s gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  a percentage point increase from the prior year period 
during  due to increases in our key raw materials principally steel and wood  our average per trailer raw material costs  including the effects of product mix increased approximately from the prior period  which exceeded increases in our average selling price resulting in a negative impact on gross profit of million 
the shortfall from rising material costs was more than offset by the continued improvement in our labor and overhead utilization of million  the impact of higher volumes of million and a reduction in warranty expense of million 
the gross profit in the retail and distribution segment improved million from the prior year 
the period included a million asset impairment charge and million of gross profit associated with the asset sales 
gross profit in was positively impacted by higher new trailer volumes and margins and improved used trailer margins  offset by continued constraints on used trailer volumes 
the period includes million of profit related to the sale of used roadrailer r bogies 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for of million were flat compared to the prior year 
the period included million in increased technology costs and million in charges related to legal settlements 
the period included million in debt refinancing costs  million in costs from operations affected by the asset sales and million related to branch closings 
selling expense selling expense decreased million to million in  compared to million in the prior year period due to the impact of the asset sales and the closing of branch locations during other income expense interest expense totaled million in  a decrease of million from the prior year period due to lower effective interest rates resulting from the debt refinancing completed in the third quarter of and reduced average borrowings 
foreign exchange was a gain of million in and a gain of million in  which reflected the significant weakening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar in loss on debt extinguishment was million in and million in the loss represents the additional costs associated with the early extinguishment of the company s senior series notes and bank debt 
the loss represents the write off of deferred debt costs associated with the pay off of our bank term loan in the fourth quarter with proceeds from the common stock issuance 
other  net was income of million in  compared to an expense of million for the period 
the expense included a million loss on the sale of a large portion of our finance portfolio  million charge for the settlement of a legacy roadrailer r transaction and a million loss on the sale of certain assets  offset by gains of million on the sale of closed branch properties 
income taxes in  we recognized income tax expense of million primarily related to federal and state alternative minimum tax amt 
the income tax expense is significantly below the normal statutory tax rate primarily because of the utilization of net operating loss nol carryforwards 
no income tax expense or benefit was recognized in because of uncertainty related to the realizability of nols in excess of those utilized  a full valuation allowance continues to be recorded against deferred tax assets at december  compared to net sales net sales improved from base upon act data  the first quarter of is believed to have been the low point of the industry downturn that began in by business segment  net external sales and related units sold were as follows dollars in millions years ended december  change net sales by segment manufacturing retail and distribution total new trailer units manufacturing   retail and distribution   total   used trailer units   the manufacturing segment s sales improvement was driven by demand for new trailers and improved product mix 
average selling price increased primarily due to product mix for example  we sold approximately  fewer lower priced containers and chassis in compared to the decrease in the retail and distribution segment s net sales reflects used trailer sales decline of million as unit sales fell due to completing the disposition of excess inventories during and the impact of closing certain locations  the sale of certain assets of the aftermarket parts distribution business and the trailer rental and leasing business in september primarily accounts for million of the sales decline  branch parts and services sales decline of million primarily due to closing full service branches  offset by new trailer sales increase of million due to a increase in equivalent store units sold  offset partially by the impact of closing certain locations 
gross profit loss gross profit as a percent of sales was for compared to in  before asset impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively 
the asset impairment charge was taken on certain assets of the rental and leasing and aftermarket parts businesses 
a summary of gross profit by segment follows in millions years ended december  change gross profit loss by segment manufacturing retail and distribution eliminations total gross profit the manufacturing segment s gross profit increased due to higher volumes and improved product mix  coupled with realizing cost savings driven by our continuous improvement initiatives 
the segment s gross profit percentage of exceeded the attained in  the most recent production cycle peak 
the retail and distribution segment s gross profit for was negatively impacted by the million asset impairment charge and million in trailer valuation charges 
gross profit for was negatively impacted by million in loss contingencies and asset impairment charges related to equipment held for lease and million in used trailer valuation charges 
additionally  the lower gross profit resulted from lower margins on used trailer sales and the impact of selling certain assets of the rental and leasing and aftermarket parts businesses in september new trailers margins held steady in relation to general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for  compared to million for the same period in the expense included million in debt restructuring costs  million related to the branch closings  offset in part by a million recovery of vat taxes 
the expense included million in bad debt expense mainly related to the finance and leasing businesses  million in severance accruals  million in write downs related to the disposition of our airplane and million in debt restructuring costs 
selling expenses selling expenses decreased million to million in  compared to million in the decrease primarily reflects the impact of retail branch closings and the september sale of certain assets of our trailer rental and leasing and aftermarket parts businesses 
other income expense interest expense totaled million for  a decrease of million from the prior year 
through the first three quarters of  interest expense exceeded that of due to higher interest rates and increased amortization of debt costs resulting from debt restructurings in and the debt refinancing and assets sales during the second half of resulted in lower interest rates and average borrowings  respectively 
foreign exchange gains and losses  net were gains of million for  primarily occurring in the first six months of the year reflecting a strengthening of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar 
loss on debt extinguishment of million in primarily represents the additional costs associated with the early extinguishment of our then outstanding debt 
other  net for was a net expense of million compared to a net income of million for the same period in the period included a million loss on the sale of a large portion of our finance portfolio  million charge for the settlement of a legacy roadrailer r transaction and a million loss on the sale of certain assets  offset in part by gains of million on the sale of closed branch properties 
the period included gains on the sale of closed branch properties 
income taxes we recorded no income tax benefit in due to uncertainties surrounding the realizability of benefits associated with nols 
the benefit recorded represents an additional realizable federal nol carry back claim filed and received under the provisions of the job creation and worker assistance act of  which revised the permitted carry back period for nols generated during from two years to five years 
liquidity and capital resources capital structure today  our capital structure is comprised of a mix of equity and debt after overcoming significant losses incurred during the years through in  we were able to further solidify our financial footing through improved operating performance and proceeds from our equity offering  as well as amendments to our bank debt agreements 
these actions  described below  resulted in repayment or refinancing of essentially all of our bank debt  increased our financial flexibility and further reduced the effective rate on borrowings 
our objective is to generate operating cash flows sufficient to satisfy normal requirements for working capital and capital expenditures and be positioned to take advantage of market opportunities 
equity offering on november   we completed the issuance of  shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds of million 
with the proceeds from the issuance  we paid off the remaining balance on our bank term loan of million  using the remaining proceeds to pay down borrowings under our bank revolver  in conjunction with the early pay off of the bank term loan 
debt amendment on december   we amended and restated our asset based loan agreement abl facility  which we had originally entered into in september the amended facility is secured by our property  plant and equipment  inventory and accounts receivable and the amount available to borrow varies in relation to the balances of those accounts among other things  as defined in the agreements 
as of december   borrowing capacity was million with no debt outstanding 
the most notable amendments to the facility included reduced the capacity under the abl facility from million to million 
extended the maturity date of the facility from september  to september  eliminated financial covenants and certain other restrictions so long as unused availability remains above million 
allowed payment of cash dividends up to million per year 
reduced the borrowing rates and fees 
interest on the abl facility is variable  based on the london interbank offer rate libor plus basis points or the bank s alternative rate  as defined in the agreement 
at december   the day libor was 
we pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility at a rate of points per annum 
all interest and fees are paid monthly 
for the quarter ended december   the weighted average interest rate was 
cash flow operating activities provided million in cash in compared to million in the prior year period 
improved cash flows from net income adjusted for non cash items of million was more than sufficient to fund increased working capital requirements as outlined below accounts receivables increased million during compared to an increase of million in  reflecting the higher level of fourth quarter sales in both years and in  comparatively strong late in the year sales 
days sales outstanding  a measure of working capital efficiency that measures the amount of time a receivable is outstanding  was approximately days in both and inventory increased million during compared to decreasing million in the increase results from an average increase in raw material costs of approximately and early purchase of approximately million in raw materials in advance of announced price increases partially offset by reductions in new and used trailer units 
the decrease results principally from the reduction of new and used trailer units in inventory 
inventory turns  a commonly used measure of working capital efficiency that measures how quickly inventory turns  of times in was comparable to the prior year 
finance contracts decreased million in from as the wind down of our financing business continues 
investing activities used million in cash during  a decrease of million from the cash provided in  which included proceeds of million from the sale of certain assets of our trailer leasing and rental and aftermarket parts businesses 
the period included capital expenditures of million  partially offset by proceeds of million primarily from the sale of closed properties 
financing activities used million in cash during primarily for the repayment of million in debt from proceeds of a million issuance of common stock with the remainder coming from operating cash flows 
with the exception of the convertible notes  we were able to pay off substantially all of our indebtedness in capital expenditures capital spending amounted to approximately million for and is anticipated to be in the range of million for spending in is planned to include approximately million for the first phase of a million multi year program to replace four trailer assembly lines  approximately million of a million two year project for engineering and business process systems improvements and approximately million for normal maintenances 
outlook the industry recovery that began in is expected to continue into and beyond 
act estimates that production of trailers in will be approximately  units 
the continued expansion in production is predicated on a number of factors including improving general economic conditions and pent up trucking industry demand for replacement units as the average age of trailer fleets increases 
we expect to participate in the industry growth because our core customers are among the dominant participants in the trucking industry  our duraplate r trailer continues to have increased market acceptance  our focus on developing solutions that reduce our customers trailers maintenance costs  and the success we are achieving expanding our presence into the middle market carriers approximately  carriers with fleet sizes ranging from to  units that represent a fleet that totals approximately one million trailers 
in  we added approximately new customers and sold approximately  units to this segment of the market 
we believe that wabash is well positioned to benefit from an increased demand for trailers because of the improvements that have been made over the last three years 
as a result of our continuous improvement initiatives  we have reduced the total cost of producing a trailer and effectively increased production capacity 
additionally  we have become much more efficient in the use of working capital 
key to will be our ability to manage through the customers perception that raw material prices will decline in the near term with a corresponding decrease in new trailer prices 
this perception results in reduced order size and delays in order placement 
as of december   our liquidity position  cash on hand and available borrowing capacity amounted to approximately million and debt and lease obligations  both on and off the balance sheet  amounted to approximately million including million not on the balance sheet 
we expect that in  wabash will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments a summary of payments of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  both on and off balance sheet  as of december  are as follows millions thereafter total debt excluding interest senior convertible notes bank revolver other notes payable total debt other currency forward contracts operating leases total other other commercial commitments letters of credit purchase commitments residual guarantees total obligations residual guarantees represent purchase commitments related to certain new and used trailer transactions as well as certain production equipment 
we also have purchase options of million on the aforementioned trailers and equipment 
to the extent that the value of the underlying property is less than the residual guarantee and the value is not expected to be recovered  we have recorded a loss contingency 
purchase commitments include raw material purchase commitments and minimum purchase commitments under a parts purchase agreement we entered into in connection with the sale of certain assets of our aftermarket parts distribution business 
the raw material commitments relate to million of aluminum purchases 
under the parts purchase agreement  we are required to purchase approximately million and million in parts from the buyer in and  respectively 
we do not believe the purchase commitments will exceed business requirements 
operating leases represent the total future minimum lease payments 
off balance sheet transactions we entered into no off balance sheet financing transactions in and as of december   we have operating leases with future minimum lease payments of million  as disclosed in the preceding table 
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial or results of operations

opportunities and other relevant considerations 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the fair market value of new and used trailers is subject to variation particularly in times of rapidly changing market conditions 
a change in the valuation of our inventories would be approximately million 
other inflation we have historically been able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation has not had  and is not expected to have a significant impact on our business 
customer credit risk we sublease certain highly specialized roadrailer r equipment to grupo transportation marititma mexicana sa tmm  who is experiencing financial difficulties 
in august  tmm completed the restructuring of its debt agreements and is in the process of selling certain assets 
customer payments  which have historically been timely  are behind schedule 
the customer owes us million secured by highly specialized roadrailer r equipment  which due to the nature of the equipment  has a minimal recovery value

the statement is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  based upon currently outstanding options expense calculated using the black scholes model  the impact  net of tax  could amount to approximately million during the second half of and million in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we have exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to these risks 
a 
commodity price risks we are exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  wood and polyethylene 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
we may manage aluminum price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with our suppliers 
as of december   we had outstanding purchase commitments of approximately million through december for materials that will be used in the production process 
because we typically do not set prices for our products more than days in advance of our commodity purchases  we can take into account the cost of the commodity in setting our prices for each order 
to the extent that we are unable to offset the increased commodity costs in our product prices  our results would be materially and adversely affected 
b 
interest rates as of december   we had no floating rate debt outstanding 
c 
foreign exchange rates we are subject to fluctuations in the canadian dollar exchange rate that impact intercompany transactions with our canadian subsidiary  as well as us denominated transactions between the canadian subsidiaries and unrelated parties 
a five cent change in the canadian exchange rate would result in an approximately million impact on results of operations 
we have purchased canadian dollar foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate potential canadian currency fluctuation impact on working capital requirements 
as of december   we had outstanding million in forward contracts to be settled in various increments over the next two months 
the contracts are marked to market and not subject to hedge accounting 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
item b risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report before investing in our securities 
realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
risks related to our business  strategy and operations we have generated significant losses in recent periods 
we incurred significant net losses during the three years prior to in  we reported net income of million  but we reported net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our ability to achieve and sustain profitability in the future will depend on the successful continued implementation of measures to reduce costs and achieve sales goals  as well as the ability to pass on to customers increases in raw materials and components 
while we have taken steps to lower operating costs and reduce interest expense  and have seen our sales improve in recent periods  we cannot assure you that our cost reduction measures will be successful  sales will be sustained or increased or that we will achieve a sustained return to profitability 
our inventories are not managed by perpetual inventory control systems 
the systems and processes we use to manage and value our inventories require significant manual intervention and the verification of actual quantities requires physical inventories  which we take several times a year 
breakdowns of these systems and processes  and errors in inventory estimates derived from these systems and processes  could go undetected until the next physical inventory and adversely affect our operations and financial results 
an adverse change in our customer relationships or in the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business 
we have relationships with a number of customers where we supply the requirements of these customers 
we do not have binding agreements with these customers 
our success is dependent  to a significant extent  upon the continued strength of these relationships and the growth of our core customers 
we often are unable to predict the level of demand for our products from these customers  or the timing of their orders 
in addition  the same economic conditions that adversely affect us also often adversely affect our customers 
as some of our customers are highly leveraged and have limited access to capital  their continued existence may be uncertain 
one of our customers  grupo transportation marititma mexicana sa tmm  which is located in mexico  has been experiencing financial difficulties even though it restructured its debt in august  and is in the process of selling certain of its assets 
payments from tmm to us are currently behind schedule 
the customer owes us million as of december  secured by highly specialized roadrailer r equipment  which due to the nature of the equipment  has a minimal recovery value 
the loss of a significant customer or unexpected delays in product purchases could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our technology and products may not achieve market acceptance  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
we continue to introduce new products  such as the duraplatehd r and the freight pro r trailer 
we cannot assure you that these or other new products or technologies will achieve sustained market acceptance 
in addition  new technologies or products that our competitors introduce may render our products obsolete or uncompetitive 
we have taken steps to protect our proprietary rights in our new products 
however  the steps we have taken to protect them may not be sufficient or may not be enforced by a court of law 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  other parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
we have a limited number of suppliers of raw materials  an increase in the price of raw materials or the inability to obtain raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components in the manufacturing of truck trailers  such as tires  landing gear  axles and specialty steel coil used in duraplate r panels 
from time to time  there have been and may in the future continue to be shortages of supplies of raw materials or our suppliers may place us on allocation  which would have an adverse impact on our ability to meet demand for our products 
raw material shortages and allocations may result in inefficient operations and a build up of inventory  which can negatively affect our working capital position 
in addition  if the price of raw materials were to increase and we were unable to increase our selling prices or reduce our operating costs to offset the price increases  our operating margins would be adversely affected 
the loss of any of our suppliers or their inability to meet our price  quality  quantity and delivery requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
disruption of our manufacturing operations or management information systems would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we manufacture our products at two trailer manufacturing facilities in lafayette  indiana  and one hardwood floor facility in harrison  arkansas 
our primary manufacturing facility accounts for approximately of our manufacturing output 
an unexpected disruption in our production at either of these facilities or in our management information systems for any length of time would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 
many of our executive officers  including our ceo william p 
greubel and coo richard j 
giromini  are critical to the management and direction of our business 
our future success depends  in large part  on our ability to retain these officers and other capable management personnel 
the unexpected loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on the operation of our business  as we may be unable to find suitable management to replace departing executives on a timely basis 
the inability to realize additional costs savings could weaken our competitive position 
if we are unable to continue to successfully implement our program of cost reduction and continuous improvement  we may not realize additional anticipated cost savings  which could weaken our competitive position 
we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
we are subject to currency exchange rate risk related to sales through our factory owned retail distribution centers in canada 
for the years ended december  and  currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of million and million  respectively  on our results of operations 
we cannot assure you that future currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments could limit our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks 
the agreements governing our indebtedness include certain covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends on our common stock in excess of million per year  repurchase our common stock  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  make certain investments  mergers and acquisitions  and create certain liens 
additionally  should our available borrowing capacity drop below million  we would be subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which could limit our ability to make capital expenditures and further limit the amount of dividends we could pay 
our ability to comply with such agreements may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
in addition  upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt agreements  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
risks particular to the industry in which we operate our business is highly cyclical  which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
the truck trailer manufacturing industry historically has been and is expected to continue to be cyclical  as well as affected by overall economic conditions
