item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we recommend that this discussion and analysis be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
these include  but are not limited to operating results  new product introductions and sales  competitive conditions  capital expenditures and resources  manufacturing capacity utilization  customer demand and inventory levels  intellectual property issues  and the risk factors set forth in the section factors affecting future results 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  actual results could differ from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
unless otherwise required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these statements for future events or new information after the date of this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements  which are generally identified by words such as anticipates  expects  plans  and similar terms  include statements related to revenues and gross profit  restructuring and asset impairment charges  research and development activities  selling  general  and administrative expenses  intangible expenses  interest income and other  taxes  capital spending and financing transactions  as well as statements regarding successful development and market acceptance of new products  industry and overall economic conditions and demand  and capacity utilization 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances 
however  actual future results may vary from our estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical as defined by the securities and exchange commission  in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require significant management judgment and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we also have other important policies  including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk 
however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are significant  difficult or subjective 
these policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
accordingly  we consider various tax planning strategies  forecasts of future taxable income and our most recent operating results in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the consideration of the realizability of net deferred tax assets  recent results must be given substantially more weight than any projections of future profitability 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that  under applicable accounting principles  it was more likely than not that we would not realize any value for any of our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance equal to of the amount of these assets 
our assumptions regarding the ultimate realization of these assets remained unchanged in fiscal and and accordingly  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance equal to of the amount of these assets 
in addition  we record liabilities related to income tax contingencies 
determining these liabilities requires us to make significant estimates and judgments of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due based on potential tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions throughout the world 
our estimates are based on the outcomes of previous audits as well as the precedents set in tax cases which include similar tax positions to those taken by the company 
if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations  we will adjust the liability and affect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 
inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we record reserves for obsolete and excess inventory based on our forecasts of demand over specific future time horizons 
we also record reserves to value our inventory at the lower of cost or market which rely on forecasts of average selling prices asps in future periods 
actual market conditions  demand  and pricing levels in the volatile semiconductor markets that we serve may vary from our forecasts  potentially impacting our inventory reserves and resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
we own and operate our own manufacturing facilities  as described in part i of this annual report  and have also acquired certain businesses and product portfolios in recent years 
as a result we have significant property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate these items for impairment on an annual basis  or sooner  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable 
triggering events for impairment reviews may include adverse industry or economic trends  restructuring actions  lowered projections of profitability  or a sustained decline in our market capitalization 
evaluations of possible impairment and  if applicable  adjustments to carrying values  require us to estimate  among other factors  future cash flows  useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets 
actual results may vary from our expectations 
we recorded asset impairment charges of million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  we completed a transitional goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of fiscal and annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarters of fiscal   and these reviews found no impairment 
under our accounting policy we will continue to perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each future fiscal year  or more often if indicators of impairment exist 
our annual reviews consider estimates of the fair value of our reporting units and may include analyses of projected discounted cash flows using our estimates of future revenues and expenses over a multi year horizon 
as of april   our assets included million in goodwill related to the acquisitions of zettacom  newave and solidum 
overview fiscal represented our second consecutive year in which we recorded growth in revenues  operating income  and net income 
these improvements are primarily due to a recovery in the economy  the market segments we serve  demand for our products including higher sales for relatively new products such as our network search engines  and our focus on managing costs and expenses 
quarterly revenues were reasonably consistent over the course of the year  with no quarter s result more than a few percentage points above or below the four quarter average 
late in the fiscal year  we took further measures to reduce costs and improve profitability 
in the fourth fiscal quarter  we announced the consolidation of our northern california operations from multiple locations into a single new site in san jose  and the centralization and streamlining of a number of manufacturing support  sales  it  and r d positions 
shortly after the end of the fiscal year  we announced that we would also be closing our product assembly and test operations in manila  the philippines  and transferring the functions that had been performed there to either our similar facility in penang  malaysia  or to outside subcontractors 
we expect to lower our run rate expenses by approximately million per quarter as the cumulative result of the above actions  once they are fully implemented late in fiscal in part  we expect these cost reduction efforts to fund continued high levels of investment in key new product areas such as network search engines  serial switching products  and timing solutions for the communications and computing markets 
at the same time  once these actions are implemented  they should position the company to achieve significant operating profits even at current revenue levels 
results of operations revenues fiscal compared to fiscal 
our revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or compared to the previous year 
overall average selling prices asps per unit for our products increased by during fiscal as a result of favorable changes in the mix of product sold and better pricing for sram products during a portion of the year 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in overall units sold from million units in fiscal to million units in fiscal which we believe is attributable to efforts by our customers to realign their inventory levels after the pace of market recovery last year was more modest than many originally expected 
revenues for our communications and timing segment which includes nses  switching solutions  fifos  multiports  and flow control management devices  communications applications specific standard products assps  and high performance logic and timing products increased by million or 
revenues for our srams segment increased by million or 
units sold increased in our communications and timing segment by million units while units sold in our sram segment decreased by million units 
as a result of favorable shifts in product mix  asps increased for the year in both of our segments 
during fiscal  we experienced growth in each of the regions throughout the world with the americas leading the increase  up 
revenues in europe  asia pacific apac  and japan also increased by   and  respectively  in fiscal as compared to one year ago 
as a percentage of our worldwide revenues  the apac region represented the largest percentage at due primarily to the concentration of emss in the region which assemble our end customer platforms 
revenues recent trends and outlook 
after very favorable pricing trends early in fiscal  asp trends returned to the typical of quarterly price declines for our industry in the second half of the year 
however  based on our belief that customers inventory adjustments are mostly behind us  and our forecasts for new nse  dimm  and timing products  we expect unit growth to more than offset pricing pressures and result in moderate revenue growth during fiscal revenues fiscal compared to fiscal 
our revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or compared to the previous year 
overall units sold were up significantly as a result of recovery across the markets we serve from million units in fiscal to million units in fiscal  but this increase in unit volumes sold was largely offset by lower asps per unit for our products which were down by during fiscal revenues for our communications and timing segment increased by million or  while revenues for our sram segment increased by million or 
units sold were up significantly in both segments as we exited the year with increasing demand for our products 
despite seeing prices begin to stabilize late in the year  asps were down significantly for the year 
throughout fiscal  we continued to see the shift of our revenues to apac primarily related to growth in our consignment programs with emss in the region as our end customer platforms migrated there to be assembled in lower cost environments 
our revenues in apac increased significantly in fiscal as compared to fiscal  rising 
revenues in japan also increased in fiscal as compared to one year ago by approximately 
the americas region was most adversely affected by the shift  declining during the year 
in europe  revenues were also lower by approximately 
gross profit fiscal compared to fiscal 
gross profit for fiscal was million  an increase of million compared to the million recorded in fiscal our gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the increase in gross profit in fiscal was primarily attributable to the significant increase in revenues discussed above  improved manufacturing utilization  a higher proportion of our wafers at micron and finer geometries  improved sram pricing during part of the year  and lower pricing related inventory reserve requirements 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we received a sales tax refund from the state of california of million related to the manufacturers investment credit 
as this amount was originally recorded in connection with capital purchases in manufacturing and r d  we allocated the credit back to cost of revenues and r d expense based on a ratio consistent with the purchases in the years to which the credit applied 
this contributed a benefit of million to gross margin 
depreciation and technology amortization expenses were higher by million and million  respectively  due to capital expenditures during the current and prior fiscal years and the acquisition of zettacom 
allocations of manufacturing spending to r d were higher by approximately million 
we estimate that gross profit during fiscal was lower by million as a result of additional excess or obsolete reserves versus a million benefit in fiscal related to the sale of product previously reserved as excess 
gross profit fiscal compared to fiscal 
gross profit for fiscal was million  an increase of million compared to the million recorded in fiscal our gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the substantial increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to restructuring and impairment charges of million in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal in addition  gross profit benefited from significantly better manufacturing utilization in fiscal  primarily related to purposefully reducing our inventory levels throughout fiscal  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year to million at the end of the fiscal year 
depreciation and technology amortization expenses were also lower by million and million  respectively  due to the asset impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal finally  retention bonuses of million related to the closure of our salinas manufacturing facility in first quarter of fiscal did not recur in fiscal these benefits were partially offset by lower allocations of manufacturing spending to r d of approximately million 
in addition  we estimate that gross profit in fiscal benefited by million during the year as a result of sales of inventory previously reserved as excess or obsolete  slightly less than the million benefit in fiscal restructuring  asset impairment and other 
in fiscal  as part of an effort to increase our profitability  we implemented reductions in force which impacted many of our operations including our wafer fabrication facility in oregon 
we recorded restructuring charges of million  which primarily consisted of severance and termination benefits related to our reductions in force 
of the million charge  million was recorded as cost of goods sold  million as r d  and million as sg a 
as part of the announced plan  a portion of the employees will remain with the company over a transition period 
in connection with this action  we recorded retention costs of million with million recorded as cost of goods sold  million as r d  and million as sg a 
over the next months  we anticipate recording an additional million of retention costs 
in addition  during fiscal  we sold land and equipment originating from our salinas wafer fabrication facility  which had been previously impaired in fiscal as the proceeds from these sales exceeded the impaired value of the assets  we recorded gains of million which are included in restructuring  asset impairment  and other 
anticipated annual savings for fiscal as a result of restructuring actions taken in fiscal are as follows in millions cogs r d sg a total compensation related facilities total the above does not include the offsetting costs of retention and severance for those employees who were affected by the reduction in force or the anticipated savings of the closure of our manila plant announced shortly after the end of the fiscal year 
during fiscal  after three consecutive quarters in which revenues either improved or remained essentially unchanged from the immediately preceding period  revenue declined measurably in the third quarter of fiscal during the course of the fourth quarter of fiscal  taking this drop off into consideration as well as the persistent weak global and industry economic conditions  we revised our near and medium term revenue expectations downward significantly 
we also reviewed corresponding key assumptions in our overall strategic business and manufacturing capacity plans 
these material changes in our outlook and plans  which we were first able to quantify in our fiscal fourth quarter budgeting process  triggered an impairment review of our long lived assets 
our impairment review indicated that estimated future undiscounted cash flows would not be sufficient to recover the carrying values of plant and equipment related to both our wafer fabrication facility in hillsboro and our offshore test and assembly plants 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million to write down these assets  which we continue to hold and use  to their estimated fair values 
of the million charge  million was recorded as cost of revenues and the remainder as r d 
management is responsible for the estimated fair values utilized to record the asset impairment charges 
management considered a number of factors to estimate the fair values  including valuations and appraisals  when making these determinations 
methods used in estimating the fair market values of the facilities included considering results from independent appraisals which incorporated standard real estate appraisal techniques including the cost approach  the income approach  and the comparable sales approach 
for specific equipment  we estimated fair market value primarily using recent sales data available for comparable equipment 
we then compared the carrying value to the estimated fair value of the assets and recorded an impairment charge for the difference 
we also determined in the fourth quarter of fiscal that certain intangible assets related to our acquisition of newave  specifically existing technology  had also become impaired  and we recorded a million charge to cost of sales to adjust the existing technology asset to its estimated fair market value 
our revenue estimates at the time of the acquisition were made when the market outlook was considerably more favorable 
in performing the overall impairment analysis for goodwill  we followed the guidance under paragraph of sfas  which requires long lived assets  other than goodwill  be tested for impairment first and that the carrying amount of these assets be adjusted for impairment before testing goodwill 
accordingly  only after adjusting the carrying value of the above long lived assets  due to their impairment  did we then test the goodwill noting no impairment 
in fiscal  we also took actions  including reductions in force and the closure of certain design and sales facilities  to better align our business model with then current industry conditions and our revised revenue expectations 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million  which consisted primarily of severance and related termination benefits related to reductions in force totaling approximately positions 
the charges were incurred in the first  third and fourth quarters of fiscal and were recorded as cost of revenues million and operating expenses million 
at the time the impairment and restructuring charges were taken in fiscal  anticipated annual savings were as follows in millions cogs r d sg a total depreciation and amortization compensation related facilities and other total our actual results through the end of fiscal were not significantly different from our expectations  however  additional capital equipment purchases and selective additions to headcount had a partial offsetting effect 
in addition to expenses specifically identified as asset impairment and restructuring charges  we incurred other salinas related closure expenses in fiscal  mainly for retention bonuses 
these expenses totaled million in fiscal we phased out production at the salinas wafer fabrication facility and completed the transfer of production to our hillsboro wafer fabrication facility in the first quarter of fiscal  and we first realized the full benefit in gross profit of this consolidation in the second quarter of fiscal research and development 
r d expenses increased by million or in fiscal to million 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in labor related spending of million  primarily due to increased headcount and retention costs incurred in connection with the zettacom acquisition in fiscal and performance related personnel costs in connection with the improved financial results 
allocations of manufacturing spending to development activities increased by million  reflecting a higher proportional usage of manufacturing infrastructure by the r d departments 
partially offsetting these amounts was a sales tax refund allocation of million related to equipment purchases in previous fiscal years explained above in the gross margin discussion 
in addition  deferred compensation expense in connection with our acquisition of newave was lower by million as a result of the completion of the vesting provisions of arrangements with certain key newave employees 
finally  product development  photomask and related expenses also decreased during the year 
r d expenses declined by million or in fiscal to million 
the largest driver of the decrease was attributable to the asset impairments and restructuring activities  including the closure of our dallas design center  which we estimated represented a million savings for the year 
in addition  lower allocations of manufacturing costs to r d of approximately million contributed significantly to the change as manufacturing capacity was proportionally more focused on production activities rather than r d activities 
finally  deferred compensation expense in connection with our acquisition of newave was also lower by million as a result of the completion of the vesting provisions of arrangements with certain key newave employees 
in fiscal  our new product development efforts are expected to continue to focus in areas like networking and switching products such as our network search engines incorporating content addressable memory or cam technology  flow control management devices  such as spi exchange devices and multi ported specialty memory products  and timing and clock products for communications and computing applications 
in addition  we expect significant product development efforts in our newly formed serial switching division  including switch fabric and traffic management technologies 
as a result of the increased development efforts described above along with projected increases in certain performance and other related personnel costs  we expect that r d spending in fiscal will increase slightly in comparison to fiscal selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses increased by million or in fiscal to million 
the increase is primarily attributable to higher performance related personnel costs in fiscal  increased spending on outside services  such as consulting and auditing services in connection with sarbanes oxley section and increased sales related expenses  including rep commissions 
these amounts were partially offset by lower equipment depreciation costs and bad debt reserve requirements 
sg a expenses declined by million or in fiscal to million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the restructuring and other cost reduction actions executed during fiscal these actions resulted in a reduction in labor and other employee related expenses as a result of multiple reductions in force  which we estimate represented million in savings 
in addition  expenses related to outside services were lower by approximately million in fiscal as a result of cost control measures 
we currently expect the costs of infrastructure for our sg a expenses to decrease in fy  however  offsetting this would be variable  revenue related expenses such as sales related  and performance related personnel expenses 
acquired in process research and development 
during fiscal  in conjunction with our acquisition of zettacom  we recorded a million charge for acquired in process research and development ipr d 
in addition we recorded a million ipr d charge related to follow on payments during fiscal related to our acquisition of certain technologies for use in high speed packet processing from ibm 
during fiscal  in connection with the ibm transaction  we recorded a million charge for ipr d 
during fiscal  in connection with our acquisition of solidum  we recorded a million charge for acquired ipr d 
for each of these transactions  the allocation of the purchase price to ipr d was determined by identifying technologies that had not attained technological feasibility and that did not have future alternative uses 
details of significant ipr d charges are as follows in connection with the zettacom acquisition  we recorded a million charge to ipr d 
this amount was determined by identifying a project under development which was not yet proven to be technically feasible and did not have alternative future uses 
estimated future expenses were deducted and economic rents charged for the use of other assets 
based on this analysis  a present value calculation of estimated after tax cash flows attributable to the projects was computed using a discount rate of 
present values were adjusted by factors representing the percentage of completion for the project  which was estimated at 
the estimated cost to complete the research project at the date of acquisition was million 
as of april   of the four parts which make up the project under development  one had been completed 
the remaining parts are estimated to be completed by december gains and losses on equity investments  net 
activity for the periods presented is summarized as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal other than temporary impairment on netlogic shares realized gains on sales of pmc shares other than temporary impairment charge on pmc shares gains losses on equity investments  net in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our investment in netlogic microsystems 
on july   netlogic completed an initial public offering at an initial offering price of per share 
the ipo pricing  less related commissions  implied the investment was worth less than its carrying value 
based in part on the relative magnitude of the decline in value  we concluded that there was an other than temporary impairment on the investment at june  and accordingly  recorded an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value down to its estimated net realizable value 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold of our investment at the previously written down value 
during fiscal  we sold our remaining shares of pmc sierra pmc resulting in a net gain of million 
during fiscal  we recorded a million pretax other than temporary impairment charge also related to this investment 
at that time  we determined that an other than temporary decline had occurred because the market value of the shares had been significantly below our carrying value for a consecutive six month period and we had no evidence that the reduction in value would be recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
interest income and other  net 
changes in interest income and other  net are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal interest income other income  net interest income and other  net the million decrease in interest income in fiscal is primarily attributable to lower average cash and investment balances as a result of our acquisition activity and the purchase of our new campus in san jose  ca  offset by an increase in interest rates during the latter half of the fiscal year 
the million decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to lower average interest rates on our investment portfolio  as the proceeds of maturing investments were reinvested in a lower interest rate environment 
the million decrease in other income  net in fiscal is primarily attributable to lower gains recognized on the sale of short term investments 
other income  net  increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of higher gains on sales of investments throughout fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal against all our net deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a tax benefit for tax losses and tax credits generated during fiscal and  as we maintain the position that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize our net deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
even though we generated taxable income for fiscal and  and we currently expect to be profitable for fiscal  we are required to place substantially more weight on our historical results over a longer period than the current or prior fiscal years 
as such  we have determined that a valuation allowance is still appropriate at the end of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal we signed an advanced pricing agreement apa with the internal revenue service irs settling an issue related to transfer pricing 
as a result  at some point in the future  we will be required to make cash payments attributable to withholding taxes in the philippines of approximately million 
upon signing the apa we reduced our related tax reserve by a net million 
also  in connection with the announced closure of our philippine manufacturing facility  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million tax provision resulting from the potential repatriation of related earnings to the united states 
the tax benefit recorded for fiscal includes million for tax refunds we received related to previous tax years 
the benefit of these refunds was partially offset by tax expense related to income generated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
our tax provision of million for fiscal consists primarily of a valuation allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal against our net deferred tax assets 
as a result of establishing this valuation allowance  we recorded no tax benefit on pretax losses and tax credits generated during fiscal liquidity and capital resources our cash and marketable securities were million at april   a decrease of million compared to march  long and short term debt  excluding operating leases  were and million as of april  and march   respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  we recorded net income of million as compared to net income of million in the prior year 
non cash adjustments were significantly higher in fiscal  including those related to an other than temporary equity investment impairment charge of million  acquisition related costs  which were higher by million as a result of higher in process r d charges by million  higher acquisition related intangible amortization by million as a result of the zettacom acquisition  and the existing technology impairment in relation to newave  and depreciation  which was higher by million as a result of capital expenditures over the past year 
net sources of cash related to working capital related items decreased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal working capital items consuming relatively more cash during fiscal included an increase in inventories of million as compared to a reduction of million in the year ago period 
we grew inventory levels early in fiscal in anticipation of increased demand which did not materialize as compared to the previous year when we were purposely lowering our inventory levels  the net effect of prepayments and other assets of million  primarily as a result of million of proceeds from the sales of building and equipment from our closed salinas facility  and the receipt of approximately million related to a distributor financing arrangement  both occurring during and not recurring in  a decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors of million as compared to an increase of million in the year ago period as distributors managed inventory more cautiously in compared to the same period in  a decrease in accounts payable during fiscal compared to an increase in fiscal  using million more net cash  and a decrease in income tax payable of million in fiscal as compared to an increase of million in the year ago period 
we decreased tax reserves in connection with a partial audit settlement with the irs audit in fiscal the above factors were partially offset by other working capital items that provided relatively more cash in fiscal  including a slight decrease in accounts receivable during fiscal of million compared to an increase of million in fiscal combined for a change of approximately million  and an increase in accrued compensation and related expenses of million as compared to an increase of million in the year ago period 
the increase relates primarily to the timing of payroll  with two weeks accrued at the end of fiscal versus one week at the end of fiscal  along with additional costs in connection with the improved financial results 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal the majority of the increase relates to cash provided by net income adjusted for non cash items 
in addition  working capital sources of cash included decreases in inventories  net and other assets  as well as an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors 
other assets decreased as a result of million in net proceeds from the sale of building and equipment  classified as assets held for sale  related to our salinas facility and million related to a financing repayment from a distributor during the year 
inventories decreased as a result of the management of our inventory levels during the year and stronger demand for our products 
deferred income on shipments to distributors increased by million over this period  as our distributors began to increase their inventory levels to meet anticipated customer demand 
working capital uses of cash included an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in other accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable increased during the year as a result of higher revenues  the effect of distributors building inventory where accounts receivable increases as channel inventory grows and the continued shift in our business to emss  particularly in apac  who have negotiated extended payment terms 
the decrease in other accrued liabilities primarily relates to deferred revenue which was recognized during the year in connection with license agreements 
our investing activities used million of cash in fiscal as compared to a use of cash of million in fiscal in fiscal  our acquisition related expenditures were significantly higher as we paid million  net of cash acquired  in connection with the acquisition of zettacom 
other than the zettacom transaction  various technology acquisitions consumed million in cash in fiscal  down from million in in fiscal  our sales of short term investments  net of purchases  were million higher than in the comparable period of fiscal finally  capital expenditures in fiscal were higher by million as we purchased a new corporate campus and  earlier in the year  new equipment primarily to increase our manufacturing capacity early in fiscal we used million of cash in fiscal as compared to a use of million for investing activities in fiscal in fiscal  our proceeds from sales of short term investments  net of purchases  were million lower than fiscal while purchases of plant and equipment decreased by million as we tightened our capital spending budget entering the year in an effort to control costs 
in addition  fiscal contained two significant expenditures of cash which did not recur in fiscal related to terminating the synthetic lease related to our hillsboro  oregon  manufacturing site by purchasing approximately million in additional fixed assets and our investment of million in an interest bearing  convertible financial instrument which was subsequently converted into preferred shares of a privately held technology company 
our financing activities in fiscal used million in cash as compared to cash provided of million in fiscal the main source of cash inflows in fiscal related to million attributable to issuances of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan 
however  we used million to repurchase common stock and million for lease and debt payments in fiscal as compared to only million for lease and debt payments and no common stock repurchases in fiscal our financing activities in fiscal provided million in cash as compared to cash used of million in fiscal the main source of cash inflows in fiscal related to million attributable to issuances of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan 
in addition  there were no repurchases of common stock during fiscal as compared to repurchases of million in fiscal we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  to be financed through cash generated from operations and existing cash and investments 
this estimate includes costs for construction related to our new campus in san jose  ca 
the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at april   and the expected timing and effects of these commitments on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent binding contractual obligations  as purchase orders often represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we generally do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation prior to services being performed without significant penalty 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through fiscal we may choose to investigate other financing alternatives  however  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
inventory costs sfas 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to costs of conversion be based upon the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory cost incurred in fiscal years beginning after june  as such  the company is required to adopt these provisions at the beginning of fiscal the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payments sfas r 
generally  the requirements of sfas r are similar to those of sfas however  sfas r requires companies to now recognize all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the payments 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
we are required to adopt sfas r beginning with the first quarter of our fiscal year sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that are unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method and also permits companies to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption using the amounts previously calculated for pro forma disclosure under sfas we have not yet determined which method we will select for our adoption of sfas r 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options through our consolidated statements of operations but rather  disclose the effect in our consolidated financial statement footnotes 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our reported results of operations 
however  the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
the company has not yet completed its analysis of the impact of adopting sfas r and is therefore currently unable to quantify the effect on its financial statements 
however  the adoption of this new statement will have a significant impact on the results of operations and net income per share of the company as the company will be required to expense the fair value of all share based payments 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to us companies  provided certain criteria are met 
fsp no 
provides accounting and disclosure guidance on the impact of the repatriation provision on a company s income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the company is currently studying the impact of the one time favorable foreign dividend provision and intend to complete the analysis by january  accordingly  the company has not adjusted its income tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the tax impact of any repatriation of non us earnings it may make 
factors affecting future results our operating results can fluctuate dramatically 
we recorded net income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  after recording a loss of million in fiscal fluctuations in operating results can result from a wide variety of factors  including the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and industry wide wafer processing capacity  changes in demand for our products and in the markets we serve  the success and timing of new product and process technology announcements and introductions from us or our competitors  potential loss of market share among a concentrated group of customers  competitive pricing pressures  changes in the demand for and mix of products sold  complex manufacturing and logistics operations  availability and costs of raw materials  and of foundry and other manufacturing services  costs associated with other events  such as intellectual property disputes  or other litigation  and political and economic conditions in various geographic areas 
in addition  many of these factors also impact the recoverability of the carrying value of certain manufacturing  tax  goodwill  and other tangible and intangible assets 
as business conditions change  future write downs or abandonment of these assets could occur 
for example  in fiscal  we recorded impairment charges totaling million for certain manufacturing  research and development  intangible and tax assets 
further  we may be unable to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors  and our operating results could be harmed by increased competition 
our operating results are also impacted by changes in overall economic conditions  both domestically and abroad 
should economic conditions deteriorate  domestically or overseas  our sales and business results could be harmed 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry exacerbates the volatility of our operating results 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
substantial changes in demand for our products have occurred rapidly in the past 
in addition  market conditions characterized by excess supply relative to demand and resulting pricing declines have also occurred in the past 
significant shifts in demand for our products and pricing declines resulting from excess supply may occur in the future 
large and rapid swings in demand and pricing for our products can result in significantly lower revenues and underutilization of our fixed cost infrastructure  both of which would cause material fluctuations in our gross margins and our operating results 
demand for our products depends primarily on demand in the communications markets 
the majority of our products are incorporated into customers systems in enterprise carrier class network  wireless infrastructure and access network applications 
a smaller percentage of our products also serve in customers computer storage  computer related  and other applications 
customer applications for our products have historically been characterized by rapid technological change and significant fluctuations in demand 
demand for most of our products  and therefore potential increases in revenue  depends upon growth in the communications market  particularly in the data networking and wireless telecommunications infrastructure markets and  to a lesser extent  the computer related markets 
any slowdown in these communications or computer related markets could materially adversely affect our operating results  as most recently evidenced by conditions in fiscal our results are dependent on the success of new products 
new products and wafer processing technology will continue to require significant r d expenditures 
if we are unable to develop  produce and successfully market new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins comparable to or better than our current products  our future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
in addition  our future revenue growth is also partially dependent on our ability to penetrate new markets  where we have limited experience and where competitors are already entrenched 
even if we are able to develop  produce and successfully market new products in a timely manner  such new products may not achieve market acceptance 
we are dependent on a concentrated group of customers for a significant part of our revenues 
we are dependent on a limited number of oems as our end customers  and our future results depend significantly on the strategic relationships we have formed with them 
if these relationships were to diminish  and if these customers were to develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution instead of buying our products  our results could be adversely affected 
for example  any diminished relationship with cisco or other key customers could adversely affect our results 
while we sell essentially nothing to cisco directly  we estimate that when all channels of distribution are considered  including sales of product to ems customers  cisco represented approximately of our total revenues for fiscal many of our end customer oems have outsourced their manufacturing to a concentrated group of global emss who then buy product directly from us on behalf of the oem 
emss have achieved greater autonomy in the design win  product qualification and product purchasing decisions  especially for commodity products 
furthermore  these emss have generally been centralizing their global procurement processes 
this has had the effect of concentrating a significant percentage of our revenue with a small number of companies 
competition for the business of these emss is intense and there is no assurance we can remain competitive and retain our existing market share within these customers 
if these companies were to allocate a higher share of commodity or second source business to our competitors instead of buying our products  our results would be adversely affected 
furthermore  as these emss represent a growing percentage of our overall business  our concentration of credit and other business risks with these customers has increased 
competition among global emss is intense  they operate on extremely thin margins  and their financial condition  on average  declined significantly during the industry downturn in fiscal if any one or more of these global emss were to file for bankruptcy or otherwise experience significantly adverse financial conditions  our business would be adversely impacted as well 
during fiscal  one ems  celestica  accounted for approximately of our revenue and represented approximately of our accounts receivable as of april  finally  we utilize a relatively small number of global and regional distributors around the world  who also buy product directly from us on behalf of their customers 
if our business relationships were to diminish or any one or more of these global distributors were to file for bankruptcy or otherwise experience significantly adverse financial conditions  our business could be adversely impacted 
one distributor  avnet represented of revenues for fiscal our product manufacturing operations are complex and subject to interruption 
from time to time  we have experienced production difficulties  including reduced manufacturing yields or products that do not meet our or our customers specifications that have caused delivery delays  quality problems  and possibly lost revenue opportunities 
while delivery delays have been infrequent and generally short in duration  we could experience manufacturing problems  capacity constraints and or product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  complexity of manufacturing processes  changes to our process technologies including transfers to other facilities and die size reduction efforts  and ramping production and installing new equipment at our facilities 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from products manufactured at facilities which are exposed to the risk of natural disasters 
we have a wafer fabrication facility in hillsboro  oregon  and assembly and test facilities in the philippines and malaysia 
if we were unable to use our facilities  as a result of a natural disaster or otherwise  our operations would be materially adversely affected 
while we maintain certain levels of insurance against selected risks of business interruption  not all risks can be insured at a reasonable cost 
even if we have purchased insurance  the adverse impact on our business  including both costs and lost revenue opportunities  could greatly exceed the amounts  if any  that we might recover from our insurers 
we are dependent upon electric power generated by public utilities where we operate our manufacturing facilities and we have periodically experienced electrical power interruptions 
we maintain limited backup generating capability  but the amount of electric power that we can generate on our own is insufficient to fully operate these facilities  and prolonged power interruptions could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
historically  we have utilized subcontractors for the majority of our incremental assembly requirements  typically at higher costs than at our own malaysian and philippine assembly and test operations with the planned closure of our manila facility in fiscal our increased reliance on subcontractors increases certain risks because we have less control over manufacturing quality and delivery schedules  maintenance of sufficient capacity to meet our orders and maintaining assembly processes we require 
we expect to increase our use of subcontractors to supplement our own production capacity 
due to production lead times and potential subcontractor capacity constraints  any failure on our part to adequately forecast the mix of product demand and resulting subcontractor requirements could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  we cannot be certain that these subcontractors will continue to assemble  package  and test products for us on acceptable economic and quality terms or at all and it may be difficult for us to find alternatives if they don t do so 
much of our manufacturing capability is relatively fixed in nature 
much of our manufacturing cost structure remains fixed in nature and large and rapid swings in demand for our products can make it difficult to efficiently utilize this capacity on a consistent basis 
significant downturns  as we have most recently experienced in fiscal  will result in material under utilization of our manufacturing facilities while sudden upturns could leave us short of capacity and unable to capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities 
these swings and the resulting under utilization of our manufacturing capacity or inability to procure sufficient capacity to meet end customer demand for our products will cause material fluctuations in the gross margins we report  and could have a material adverse affect thereon 
we build most of our products based on estimated demand forecasts 
demand for our products can change rapidly and without advance notice 
demand can also be affected by changes in our customers levels of inventory and differences in the timing and order patterns between them and their end customers 
if demand forecasts are inaccurate or change suddenly  we may be left with large amounts of unsold products  may not be able to fill all orders in the short term and may not be able to accurately forecast capacity utilization or make optimal investment and other business decisions 
this can leave us holding excess and obsolete inventory or unable to meet customer short term demands  either of which can have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate raw materials on a timely basis 
the number of vendors of certain raw materials  such as silicon wafers  ultra pure metals and certain chemicals and gases  is very limited 
in addition  certain packages require long lead times and are available from only a few suppliers 
from time to time  vendors have extended lead times or limited supply to us due to capacity constraints 
although we currently fabricate most of our wafers internally  we are dependent on outside foundries for a small but growing portion of our wafer requirements 
similarly  while we currently conduct most assembly and test operations internally  we do rely upon subcontractors for a significant portion of these back end services 
our results of operations would be materially adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if there were significant increases in the costs of raw materials  or if foundry or back end subcontractor capacity was not available  or was only available at uncompetitive prices 
we are subject to a variety of environmental and other regulations related to hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes 
any failure by us to adequately control the use or discharge of hazardous materials under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial costs or liabilities or cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended 
intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business and operations 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
we have been involved in patent litigation in the past  which adversely affected our operating results 
although we have obtained patent licenses from certain semiconductor manufacturers  we do not have licenses from a number of semiconductor manufacturers that have broad patent portfolios 
claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights have been asserted against us and could be asserted against us in the future 
these claims could result in our having to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  incur significant litigation costs and damages  and develop non infringing technology 
we might not be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or to develop non infringing technology 
further  the failure to renew or renegotiate existing licenses on favorable terms  or the inability to obtain a key license  could materially adversely affect our business 
international operations add increased volatility to our operating results 
a growing and now substantial percentage of our revenues are derived from international sales  as summarized below percentage of total revenues fiscal fiscal fiscal americas asia pacific japan europe total in addition  our assembly and test facilities in malaysia and the philippines  our design centers in canada  china and australia  and our foreign sales offices incur payroll  facility and other expenses in local currencies 
accordingly  movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our revenues and costs of goods sold  as well as both pricing and demand for our products 
our offshore sites and export sales are also subject to risks associated with foreign operations  including political instability and acts of war or terrorism  which could disrupt our manufacturing and logistical activities  currency controls and fluctuations  changes in local economic conditions  and changes in tax laws  import and export controls  tariffs and freight rates 
contract pricing for raw materials and equipment used in the fabrication and assembly processes  as well as for foundry and subcontract assembly services  can also be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
finally  in support of our international operations  a portion of our cash and investment portfolio resides offshore 
at april   we had cash and investments of approximately million invested overseas in accounts belonging to various idt foreign operating entities 
while these amounts are primarily invested in us dollars  a portion is held in foreign currencies  and all offshore balances are exposed to local political  banking  currency control and other risks 
we depend on the ability of our personnel  raw materials  equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world 
any political  military  world health eg  sars or other issue which hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions 
furthermore  any strike  economic failure  or other material disruption on the part of major airlines or other transportation companies could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology  or directly impact our marketing  manufacturing  financial and logistics functions our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility 
such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of idt  other semiconductor companies  or our customers 
stock price volatility may also result from product announcements by us or our competitors  or from changes in perceptions about the various types of products we manufacture and sell 
in addition  our stock price may fluctuate due to price and volume fluctuations in the stock market  especially in the technology sector 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers  technical personnel or other key employees could adversely affect our business 
in addition  our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical and management personnel 
if we are unable to identify and hire highly qualified technical and managerial personnel  our business could be harmed 
we may have difficulty integrating acquired companies and technologies 
we acquired zettacom in fiscal and certain technologies from ibm in fiscal in addition  we acquired newave and solidum in fiscal and  respectively  and we may pursue other acquisitions in the future 
failure to successfully integrate acquired companies and technologies into our business could adversely affect our results of operations 
integration risks and issues may include  but are not limited to  key personnel retention and assimilation  management distraction  technology development  and unexpected costs and liabilities  including goodwill impairment charges 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of april  by policy  we limit our exposure to long term investments  and a substantial majority of our investment portfolio at the end of fiscal and had maturities of less than two years 
as a result of a relatively short duration of our portfolio  a hypothetical move in interest rates would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we mitigate the credit risk through diversification and adherence to high credit quality rating standards 
we further minimize our risks by restricting the sector concentration and asset allocation of certain types of securities in our investment portfolio 
we do not have any outstanding debt as of april   and had million in debt as of march  we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk as a result of our international operations  assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  and to a lesser extent  capital purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
the major currency risk of our international operations consist of operating expenses denominated in malaysian ringgit  philippine peso  canadian dollar  chinese yuan  australian dollar  japanese yen  euro  and british pound 
we use derivative financials instruments which are principally forward contracts to help manage our foreign currency exposures 
we do not enter into derivatives for trading purposes 
the company has not hedged any currency risk of its malaysian subsidiary since the currency has been fixed at ringgit to the us dollar for over eight years 
there is heightened speculation in the currency market that this currency peg may change some time in the near term 
we performed a sensitivity analysis for both fiscal and including the risk of a currency move in malaysia  and determined that a change in the value of the us dollar would have less than a million near term impact on our financial position and results of operations and cash flows 
the company did not have any currency exposure related to any outstanding capital purchases as of april  or march
