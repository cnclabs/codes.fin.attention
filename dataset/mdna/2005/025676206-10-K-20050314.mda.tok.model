overview we specialize in the sale of individual annuities primarily deferred annuities and  to a lesser extent  we also sell life insurance policies 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  premium collections for deferred annuities are reported as deposit liabilities instead of as revenues 
sources of revenues for products accounted for as deposit liabilities are net investment income  surrender charges deducted from the account balances of policyholders in connection with withdrawals  realized gains and losses on investments and changes in fair value of derivatives 
components of expenses for products accounted for as deposit liabilities are interest credited to account balances  changes in fair value of embedded derivatives  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements  other operating costs and expenses and income taxes 
earnings from products accounted for as deposit liabilities are primarily generated from the excess of net investment income earned over the interest credited to the policyholder  or the investment spread 
in the case of index annuities  the investment spread consists of net investment income in page of excess of the cost of the options purchased to fund the index based component of the policyholder s return and amounts credited as a result of minimum guarantees 
our investment spread is summarized as follows year ended december  average yield on invested assets cost of money aggregate average net cost of money for index annuities average crediting rate for fixed rate annuities annually adjustable multi year rate guaranteed investment spread aggregate index annuities fixed rate annuities annually adjustable multi year rate guaranteed the average crediting rates and investment spreads are computed without the impact of amortization of deferred sales inducements 
see critical accounting policies deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements 
with respect to our index annuities  the cost of money includes the average crediting rate on amounts allocated to the fixed rate options  expenses we incur to fund the annual income credits and minimum guaranteed interest credited on the index business 
proceeds received upon expiration or early termination of call options purchased to fund annual index credits are recorded as part of the change in fair value of derivatives  and are largely offset by an expense for interest credited to annuity policyholder account balances 
see critical accounting policies derivative instruments index products 
our profitability depends in large part upon the amount of assets under our management  investment spreads we earn on our policyholders account balances  our ability to manage our investment portfolio to maximize returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes  defaults or impairment of assets  our ability to manage costs of the options purchased to fund the annual index credits on our index annuities  our ability to manage the costs of acquiring new business principally commissions to agents and first year bonuses credited to policyholders and our ability to manage our operating expenses 
critical accounting policies the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require us to closely monitor our accounting policies 
we have identified four critical accounting policies that are complex and require significant judgment 
the following summary of our critical accounting policies is intended to enhance your ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates 
valuation of investments our fixed maturity securities bonds and redeemable preferred stocks maturing more than one year after issuance and equity securities common and non redeemable preferred stocks classified as available for sale are reported at estimated fair value 
unrealized gains and losses  if any  on these page of securities are included directly in a separate component of stockholders equity  net of income taxes and certain adjustments for assumed changes in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements 
fair values for securities that are actively traded are determined using quoted market prices 
for fixed maturity securities that are not actively traded  fair values are estimated using price matrices developed using yield data and other factors relating to instruments or securities with similar characteristics 
the carrying amounts of all our investments are reviewed on an ongoing basis for credit deterioration 
if this review indicates a decline in market value that is other than temporary  our carrying amount in the investment is reduced to its fair value and a specific writedown is taken 
such reductions in carrying amount are recognized as realized losses and charged to earnings 
our periodic assessment of our ability to recover the amortized cost basis of investments that have materially lower quoted market prices requires a high degree of management judgment and involves uncertainty 
factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary include the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the investment is rated investment grade  whether the issuer is current on all payments and all contractual payments have been made as agreed  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery  consideration of rating agency actions  changes in cash flows of asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  for securities expected to be sold  an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized if we do not expect the fair value of a security to recover to cost or amortized cost prior to the expected date of sale 
once an impairment charge has been recorded  we then continue to review the other than temporarily impaired securities for appropriate valuation on an ongoing basis 
realized losses through a charge to earnings may be recognized in future periods should we later conclude that the decline in market value below amortized cost is other than temporary pursuant to our accounting policy described above 
page of at december  and  the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities and equity securities that were in an unrealized loss position were as follows december  december  number of positions amortized cost unrealized losses estimated fair value number of positions amortized cost unrealized losses estimated fair value dollars in thousands dollars in thousands fixed maturity securities available for sale united states government and agencies   public utilities  corporate securities    redeemable preferred stocks   mortgage and asset backed securities united states government and agencies   non government    held for investment united states government and agencies   equity securities  available for sale non redeemable preferred stocks   common stocks    the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities at december  and  by contractual maturity  that were in an unrealized loss position are shown below 
actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties

at december  and  the fair value of investments we owned that were non investment grade or not rated was million and million  respectively 
non investment grade or not rated securities represented and at december  and  respectively  of the fair value of our fixed maturity securities 
the unrealized losses on investments we owned that were non investment grade or not rated at december  and  were million and million  respectively 
the unrealized losses on such securities at december  and represented and  respectively  of gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities at december   we identified certain invested assets which have characteristics ie significant unrealized losses compared to book value and industry trends creating uncertainty as to our future assessment of other than temporary impairments 
this list is referred to as our watch list 
we have excluded from this list securities with unrealized losses which are related to market movements in interest rates and which have no factors indicating that such unrealized losses may be other than temporary 
we have reviewed these investments and concluded that there were no other than temporary impairments on these investments at december  at december   the amortized cost and estimated fair value of each fixed maturity security on the watch list are as follows issuer amortized cost unrealized losses estimated fair value maturity date months below amortized cost dollars in thousands continental airlines b    land o lakes capital securities a    northwest airlines pass thru certificates class c  pegasus aviation a c    page of our analysis of these securities and their credit performance at december  is as follows continental airlines pass thru certificates class b are backed by the general credit of continental airlines as well as the collateral from a pool of airplanes 
we determined that an other than temporary impairment charge was not necessary for the following reasons i we believed that continental airlines improving liquidity reduced the likelihood of bankruptcy and ii even if continental airlines were to declare bankruptcy  the chance of full recovery on this security was high due to the excess collateral coverage supplied by the aircraft collateral 
land o lakes is a national  farmer owned food and agricultural cooperative 
we determined that an other than temporary impairment charge was not necessary for the following reasons i land o lakes operates in a cyclical industry and had successfully managed through previous cyclical lows  ii we calculated that land o lakes had adequate ebitda to interest coverage of bank debt and times for bond debt and determined that land o lakes had adequate liquidity  iii land o lakes was in the process of improving its balance sheet by maintaining liquidity and selling non strategic assets and investments  and iv further improvements were expected in the future 
northwest airlines pass thru certificates class c are backed by the general credit of northwest airlines as well as the collateral from a pool of airplanes 
we determined that an other than temporary impairment charge was not necessary for the following reasons i we believed that a bankruptcy was unlikely since northwest had begun to see benefits from its attempts to return to profitability  ii we believed northwest had adequate liquidity  iii we calculated northwest to have unrestricted cash at the end of the third quarter of of approximately billion  iv even if northwest declared bankruptcy  these bonds would have remained current for at least months due to a liquidity coverage feature and the bonds could remain current after months if northwest affirmed the leases on the planes in the collateral pool in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy  and v based upon the liquidity of northwest billion at september  
pegasus aviation a c is backed by leases on airplanes and is structured as a pass through security 
we took an impairment charge of million on this security in the fourth quarter of because we did not expect to receive further principal payments 
however  due to the continued problems in the leased airplane industry  the market value of this security had declined further 
we determined that no additional other than temporary impairment change was necessary for the following reasons i although we did not expect to receive principal payments on this security  we expected that interest payments would continue to be made until and ii the value of the expected future interest payments supported the current book value 
each of the four securities on the watch list is current in respect to payments of principal and interest 
we have concluded for each of the four securities on the watch list that we have the intent and the ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value 
we took writedowns on certain other investments that we concluded did have an other than temporary impairment during  and of million  million and million  respectively 
following is a discussion of each security for which we have taken write downs during the years ended december   and we owned the class a a tranche of the juniper collateralized bond obligation 
we wrote down this security by million to its fair value in the first quarter of due to the structure of payments from the collateralized bond obligation  it was likely that we would continue receiving interest payments for the foreseeable future  but it was unlikely that we would receive our entire page of principal at maturity 
the fair value of this security continued to decline in subsequent months and we sold the bond at an additional loss of million in the second quarter of pegasus a c is an asset backed security backed by leases on specific aircraft 
we wrote down this security by million in the third quarter of the downturn in the airline industry had caused lease rates on renewing leases to be significantly below expectations and this was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on september  due to the continuing problems in the airline industry and continued lower lease rates on renewing leases  we took an additional write down of million on this security in the first quarter of jet equipment trust is an asset backed security backed by collateral from a pool of planes and the general credit of united airlines 
we wrote down this security by million in the third quarter of the downturn in the airline industry and the possibility of united airlines declaring bankruptcy had caused this security to trade significantly below cost at the time of the original write down 
united airlines declared bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of and discontinued making lease payments on the planes that support this trust 
due to the fact that any further payments on this security were unlikely  we took an additional write down of million in the fourth quarter of to reduce the book value to zero 
oakwood mortgage e class m is an asset backed security backed by installment sales contracts secured by manufactured homes and liens on real estate 
we wrote down this security by million in the third quarter of due to continuing high default rates for the manufactured housing industry causing doubt about the return of the entire principal balance 
we wrote this security down by an additional million during the fourth quarter of due to further deterioration in default rates 
oakwood mortgage c class m is backed by installment sales contracts secured by manufactured homes and liens on real estate 
we wrote this security down by million in the first quarter of due to an increase in default rates and realized losses above expected levels along with a downgrade to below investment grade on march  we took an additional writedown on this security of million in the third quarter of due to continued deterioration in default rates 
diversified asset securities ii class b is a pool of asset backed securities that entitle the holders thereof to receive payments that depend primarily on the cash flow from a specified pool of financial assets 
we wrote this security down by million during the second quarter of based upon the deterioration of the underlying collateral along with a downgrade to below investment grade on june  we sold this security for an immaterial loss during the fourth quarter of in making the decisions to write down the securities described above  we considered whether the factors leading to those write downs impacted any other securities held in our portfolio 
in cases where we determined that a decline in value was related to an industry wide concern  we considered the impact of such concern on all securities we held within that industry classification 
page of below is a list of securities which we have sold at a loss excluding losses arising from interest rate changes and losses deemed immaterial 
there were no material realized losses on the sales of securities during issuer amortized cost fair value realized losses months below amortized cost dollars in thousands year ended december  transamerica capital   calpine canada    american airlines  ford motor co 
  juniper   year ended december  qwest    generally  for each of these sales there was an unexpected event resulting in a decline in credit quality which occurred shortly before the sale 
this led to the decision to sell a security at a loss concurrent with the decision that an initial or additional impairment charge was required 
accordingly  in all cases  this did not contradict our previous assertion that we had the ability and intent to hold the security until recovery in value 
each of these securities and the factors resulting in the sales of such securities are discussed individually below 
transamerica capital was sold to reduce our exposure to european insurance companies and not as a result of deteriorating credit quality 
calpine canada was sold because it engaged in re financing activities that threatened its long term profitability and exacerbated its reliance on leverage 
the wholesale power market in which it was engaged was expected to be weak 
american airlines pass thru certificates  which were collateralized by a pool of airplanes  were sold as a result of inadequate collateral coverage in a potential bankruptcy situation and recent changes regarding the airline s bank covenants regarding required minimum unrestricted cash balances 
ford motor co 
was determined to be an improving credit  however we decided to reduce our position in this security to million by selling million principal amount of these securities at a loss of million 
juniper was a collateralized debt obligation backed by corporate debt obligations rated primarily below investment grade 
in the first quarter of  we wrote this security down as a result of downgrades and significant deterioration in the value of the underlying corporate debt 
continued deterioration led us to sell the security in qwest was sold as the result of several factors  including its rapidly deteriorating operating environment  the sale of one of its business units for a value well below expectations and continuing government investigations 
derivative instruments index products we offer a variety of index annuities with crediting strategies linked to several equity market indices  including the s p  the dow jones industrial average and the nasdaq several of these products also offer a bond strategy linked to the lehman aggregate bond index or the lehman us treasury bond index 
these products allow policyholders to earn returns linked to equity or bond page of index appreciation without the risk of loss of their principal 
most of these products allow policyholders to transfer funds once a year among several different crediting strategies  including one or more of the index based strategies and a traditional fixed rate strategy 
substantially all of our index products require annual crediting of interest and an annual reset of the applicable index on the contract anniversary date 
the computation of the annual index credit is based upon either a one year annual point to point calculation ie  the gain in the applicable index from one anniversary date to the next anniversary date  a monthly averaging of the index during the contract year  or a one year monthly point to point calculation the net gain determined by adding the twelve monthly gains and losses in the applicable index within the one year period from one anniversary date to the next anniversary date 
the annuity contract value is equal to the premiums paid plus annual index credits based upon a percentage  known as the participation rate  of the annual appreciation based in some instances on monthly averages or monthly point to point calculations in a recognized index or benchmark 
the participation rate  which we may reset annually  generally varies among the index products from to 
some of the products have an asset fee ranging from to  which is deducted from the interest to be credited 
the asset fees may be adjusted annually by us  subject to stated limits 
in addition  some products apply an overall limit  or cap  ranging from to  on the amount of annual interest the policyholder may earn in any one contract year  and the applicable cap also may be adjusted annually subject to stated minimums 
the minimum guaranteed contract values range from to of the premium collected plus interest credited on the minimum guaranteed contract value at an annual rate of to 
we purchase one year call options on the applicable indices as an investment to provide the income needed to fund the amount of the annual index credits on the index products 
new one year options are purchased at the outset of each contract year 
we budget an amount to purchase the specific options needed to fund the annual index credits  and the cost of the options represents our cost of providing the credits 
the amount we budget for the purchase of index call options is based on our interest spread targets and is comparable to the credited rates of interest we offer on fixed rate annuities 
for example  if the yield on our invested assets is and our targeted spread is  we allocate up to of the premium in the first year or account balance after the first year to the purchase of one year call options 
participation rates  which define the policyholder s level of participation in index gains each year  are determined by option costs 
for example  if  based on current market conditions  the amount allocated to the purchase of options is sufficient to purchase an option that will provide a return equal to of the annual gain in the applicable index  we will set the policyholder s participation rate at 
we have the ability to modify participation rates each year when a new option is purchased 
in general  if option costs increase  participation rates may be decreased  and if option costs decrease  participation rates may be increased 
we purchase call options weekly based upon new and renewing index account values during the applicable week  and the purchases are made by category according to the particular products and indices applicable to the new or renewing account values 
any proceeds received on the options at the expiration of the one year term fund the related index credits to the policyholders 
if there is no gain in an index  the policyholder receives a zero index credit on the policy  and we incur no costs beyond the option cost  except in cases where the minimum guaranteed value of a contract exceeds its index value 
page of market value changes associated with the call options are reported as an increase or decrease in revenues in our consolidated statements of income in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the risk associated with prospective purchases of future one year options is the uncertainty of the cost  which will determine whether we are able to earn our spread on our index business 
all our index products permit us to modify participation rates  asset fees or annual income caps at least once a year 
this feature is comparable to our fixed rate annuities  which allow us to adjust crediting rates annually 
by modifying our participation rates or other features  we can limit our costs of purchasing the related one year call options  except in cases where contractual features would prevent further modifications 
based upon actuarial testing which we conduct as a part of the design of our index products and on an ongoing basis  we believe the risk that contractual features would prevent us from controlling option costs is not material 
after the purchase of the one year call options and payment of acquisition costs  we invest the balance of index premiums as a part of our general account invested assets 
with respect to the index products  our investment spread is measured as the difference between the aggregate yield on the relevant portion of our invested assets  less the aggregate option costs and the costs associated with minimum guarantees 
if the minimum guaranteed value of an index product exceeds the index value computed on a cumulative basis over the life of the contract then the general account earnings are available to satisfy the minimum guarantees 
if there were little or no gains in the entire series of one year options purchased over the expected life of an index annuity typically to years  then we would incur expenses for credited interest over and above our option costs  causing our spread to tighten and reducing our profits or potentially resulting in losses on these products 
under sfas no 
 all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts are recognized in the balance sheet at their fair values and changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings 
this impacts the items of revenue and expense we report on our index business as follows we must mark to market the purchased call options we use to fund the annual index credits on our index annuities based upon quoted market prices from related counterparties 
we record the change in fair value of these options as a component of our revenues 
included within the change in fair value of the options is an element reflecting the time value of the options  which initially is their purchase cost declining to zero at the end of their one year lives 
the change in fair value of derivatives also includes proceeds received at the expiration of the one year option terms and gains or losses recognized upon early termination 
under sfas no 
 the future annual index credits on our index annuities are treated as a series of embedded derivatives over the expected life of the applicable contracts 
we are required to estimate the fair value of policy liabilities for index annuities  including the embedded derivatives  by valuing the host or guaranteed component of the liabilities and projecting i the expected index credits on the next policy anniversary dates and ii the net cost of annual options we will purchase in the future to fund index credits 
our estimates of the fair value of these embedded derivatives are based on assumptions related to underlying policy terms including annual participation rates  asset fees  cap rates and minimum guarantees  index values  notional amounts  strike prices and expected lives of the policies 
the change in fair value of embedded derivatives increases with increases in volatility in the indices and interest rates 
the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives will not correspond to the change in fair value of the purchased options because the purchased options are one year options while the options valued in the fair value of embedded derivatives cover the expected life of the contracts which typically exceed years 
page of we adjust the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements to reflect the impact of the items discussed above 
the amounts reported with respect to our index business for sfas no 
are summarized as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands change in fair value of derivatives proceeds received at expiration or gains recognized upon early termination cost of money for index annuities    change in difference between fair value and remaining option cost at beginning and end of period   change in fair value of embedded derivatives related increase decrease in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements    deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements commissions and certain other costs relating to the production of new business are not expensed when incurred but instead are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs or deferred sales inducements 
only costs which are expected to be recovered from future policy revenues and gross profits may be deferred 
deferred policy acquisition costs consist principally of commissions and certain costs of policy issuance 
deferred sales inducements consist of first year premium and interest bonuses credited to policyholder account balances 
deferred policy acquisition costs totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
deferred sales inducements totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
for annuity and single premium universal life products  these costs are being amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from investments and  to a lesser extent  from surrender charges and mortality and expense margins 
current period amortization must be adjusted retrospectively if changes occur in estimates of future gross profits margins including the impact of realized investment gains and losses 
our estimates of future gross profits margins are based on actuarial assumptions related to the underlying policies terms  lives of the policies  yield on investments supporting the liabilities and level of expenses necessary to maintain the polices over their entire lives 
we adopted the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long durantion contracts and for separate accounts on january  as it applies to us  sop established guidance for the accounting and presentation of costs related to sales inducements 
there was no change to our method of accounting for sales inducements  however  the capitalized costs are now separately disclosed in the consolidated balance sheets and the related amortization expense is included in interest credited to account balances in the consolidated statements of income 
prior to  the capitalized costs were included in deferred policy acquisition costs and the amortization expense was included in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
the and amounts have been reclassified to conform with the presentation 
page of deferred income tax assets as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of net deferred income tax assets 
the realization of these assets is based upon estimates of future taxable income  which requires management judgement 
based upon projections of future taxable income  and considering all other available evidence  we have not recorded a valuation allowance against these assets 
results of operations for the three years ended december  annuity deposits by product type collected during  and  were as follows year ended december  product type dollars in thousands index annuities index strategies    fixed strategy    fixed rate annuities single year rate guaranteed    multi year rate guaranteed    total before coinsurance ceded    coinsurance ceded    net after coinsurance ceded    for information related to our coinsurance agreements  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
gross annuity deposits for increased in comparison to resulting from increased marketing efforts following the completion of our initial public offering ipo 
gross annuity deposits decreased in compared to resulting from actions taken by us during prior to our ipo and during the fourth quarter of to manage our capital position  including reductions in our interest crediting rates on both new and existing annuities  reductions in sales commissions and suspension of sales of one of our higher commission annuity products and our most popular multi year rate guaranteed product 
net annuity deposits after coinsurance ceded increased during compared to because we reduced the coinsurance percent in our coinsurance agreement with equitrust life insurance company equitrust  a subsidiary of fbl financial group  inc fbl  from in to in  and effective august   we suspended the equitrust coinsurance agreement 
net annuity deposits decreased in compared to due to the decrease in gross annuity deposits discussed above 
net income increased to million in  and to million in  from million in the increases in net income were principally due to growth in the volume of business in force and increases in the investment spread earned on our annuity liabilities 
our net annuity liabilities after coinsurance ceded increased from billion at the beginning of to billion at the end of as set forth in a table included earlier in this item  we increased our aggregate investment spread to in compared to in and in the increases in net income also benefitted from increasing amounts of income generated by the spread on page of our securities repurchase agreements due to increasing amounts of average borrowings outstanding under such agreements 
net income in each year was also impacted by the application of sfas no 
to our index annuity business which we estimate increased net income in and by million and million  respectively  and decreased net income in by million 
net income in was also favorably impacted by realized gains on sales of investments of million on an after tax basis 
annuity and single premium universal life product charges surrender charges assessed against policy withdrawals and mortality and expense charges assessed against single premium universal life policyholder account balances increased to million in  and to million in  from million in withdrawals from annuity and single premium universal life policies subject to surrender charges were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the average surrender charge collected on withdrawals subject to surrender charges was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in average surrender charges collected in compared to was principally due to a higher amount of surrenders in related to products which had a market value adjustment feature which reduced the amount of surrender charges collected on these surrenders 
net investment income increased to million in and to million in from million in these increases are principally attributable to the growth in our annuity business and corresponding increases in our invested assets  offset by decreases in the average yield earned on our investments 
invested assets on an amortized cost basis increased to billion at december  and to billion at december  compared to billion at december   while the yield earned on average invested assets was  and for  and  respectively 
the declines in the yield earned on average invested assets are attributable to a general decline in interest rates and the reinvestment of net redemption proceeds from called securities at lower yields 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
realized gains losses on investments fluctuate from year to year due to changes in the interest rate and economic environment and the timing of the sale of investments 
realized gains and losses on investments include gains and losses on the sale of securities as well as losses recognized when the fair value of a security is written down in recognition of an other than temporary impairment 
the components of realized gains losses on investments for the year ended december   and are summarized as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands available for sale fixed maturity securities gross realized gains    gross realized losses   writedowns other than temporary impairments   equity securities  change in fair value of derivatives call options purchased to fund annual index credits on index annuities was an increase of million in  an increase of million in and a decrease of million in see critical accounting policies derivative instruments index products for the components of the change in fair value of derivatives 
page of the difference between the change in fair value of derivatives between the periods is primarily due to the performance of the indices upon which our options are based 
a substantial portion of our options are based upon the s p index with the remainder based upon other equity and bond market indices 
the range of index appreciation for options expiring during the years ended december   and is as follows year ended december  s p index point to point strategy monthly average strategy lehman brothers us aggregate and us treasury indices actual amounts credited to policyholder account balances may be less than the index appreciation due to contractual features in the index annuity policies participation rates and caps which allow us to manage the cost of the options purchased to fund the annual index credits 
the change in fair value of derivatives is also influenced by the aggregate cost of options purchased which is related to the amount of policyholder funds allocated to the various indices  market volatility which affects option pricing and the policy terms and historical experience which affects the strikes and caps of the options we purchase 
the aggregate cost of option purchases began declining in the second quarter of when we refined our hedging process to purchase options that were out of the money to the extent of anticipated minimum guaranteed interest on the index policies 
prior to that  all options were purchased at the money at a higher cost 
the aggregate cost of option purchases increased during because more options were purchased at the money and option pricing increased due to greater market volatility 
more options have been purchased at the money or less out of the money than in preceding periods because index returns have increased  thereby reducing the impact of minimum guaranteed interest on policy values and option purchases 
see critical accounting policies derivative instruments index products 
interest credited to account balances increased to million in and to million in from million in these increases were principally attributable to index credits on index policies which increased to million and million in and as a result of increases in the underlying indices see discussion above under change in fair value of derivatives 
these increases were also attributable to a increase in the average amount of annuity liabilities outstanding net of annuity liabilities ceded under coinsurance agreements during to billion from billion during and an increase of from million during these increases were offset in part by the decrease in weighted average cost of money  which we implemented in connection with our spread management process  of basis points during  basis points during  and basis points during a component of interest credited to account balances is the amortization of deferred sales inducements 
the amortization of deferred sales inducements was million  million and million for the year december   and  respectively 
the increases in amortization during and were principally attributable to growth in the sales of our premium and interest bonus products 
the application of sfas no 
to the amortization of deferred sales inducements resulted in a million increase in amortization in  a decrease in amortization of million in and an increase in amortization of million in bonus products made up and of our total annuity deposits during and  respectively 
see critical accounting policies deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements 
page of change in fair value of embedded derivatives was a decrease of million during the year ended december  compared to an increase of million in and a decrease of million in the change in the amount of expense recognized during  and primarily resulted from the increase or decrease in expected index credits on the next policy anniversary dates  which are related to the change in the fair value of the options acquired to fund these index credits discussed above in the change in fair value of derivatives 
in addition  the host value of the index reserve liabilities increased primarily as a result of increases in index annuity premium deposits 
see critical accounting policies derivative instruments index products 
interest expense on subordinated debentures for increased to million from million in the comparable amount for was million and is reported as minority interests in subsidiaries 
the increase during compared to was due to the issuance of additional floating rate subordinated debentures during of million and million issued in december the amount of subordinated debentures outstanding at december  was million compared to million at december  see financial condition liabilities 
interest expense on amounts due under repurchase agreements and other interest expense increased to million in from million in and million in the amounts include other interest expense of million in and million in the increase in is due to an increase in interest expense on amounts due under repurchase agreements 
the decrease in is due to the reduction in other interest expense  offset in part by an increase in interest expense on amounts due under repurchase agreements 
the increases in interest expense on amounts due under repurchase agreements are principally due to increases in the borrowings outstanding which averaged million  million and million during  and  respectively and changes in the weighted average interest rates on amounts borrowed which were  and for  and  respectively

financial condition investments our investment strategy is to maintain a predominantly investment grade fixed income portfolio  provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash obligations to policyholders and others and maximize current income and total investment return through active investment management 
consistent with this strategy  our investments principally consist of fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
insurance statutes regulate the type of investments that our life subsidiaries are permitted to make and limit the amount of funds that may be used for any one type of investment 
in light of these statutes and regulations and our business and investment strategy  we generally seek to invest in united states government and government agency securities and corporate securities rated investment grade by established nationally recognized rating organizations or in securities of comparable investment quality  if not rated 
we have classified a portion of our fixed maturity investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are reported at market value and unrealized gains and losses  if any  on these securities net of income taxes and certain adjustments for changes in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements are included directly in a separate component of stockholders equity  thereby exposing stockholders equity to volatility due to changes in market interest rates and the accompanying changes in the reported value of securities classified as available for sale  with stockholders equity increasing as interest rates decline and  conversely  decreasing as interest rates rise 
cash and investments increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  as a result of the growth in our annuity business discussed above 
at december   the fair value of our available for sale fixed maturity and equity securities was million less than the amortized cost of those investments  compared to million at december  at december   the amortized cost of our fixed maturity securities held for investment exceeded the market value by million  compared to million at december  the decrease in net unrealized investment losses at december  compared to december  was generally related to a decrease in market interest rates

substantially all of our annuity products have a surrender charge feature designed to reduce the risk of early withdrawal or surrender of the policies and to compensate us for our costs if policies are withdrawn early 
notwithstanding these policy features  the withdrawal rates of policyholder funds may be affected by changes in interest rates and other factors 
as part of our investment strategy  we enter into securities repurchase agreements short term collateralized borrowings 
these borrowings are collateralized by investment securities with fair market values approximately equal to the amount due 
we earn investment income on the securities purchased with these borrowings at a rate in excess of the cost of these borrowings 
such borrowings averaged million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate on amounts due under repurchase agreements was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in december  we issued million of contingent convertible senior notes due december  through a private placement under rule a of the securities act of the notes are unsecured and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year  beginning june  in addition to regular interest on the notes  beginning with the six month interest period ending june   we page of will also pay contingent interest under certain conditions at a rate of per annum based on the average trading price of the notes during a specified period 
the notes are convertible at the holders option prior to the maturity date into cash and shares of our common stock under certain conditions 
the initial conversion price per share is which represents a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  in principal amount of notes 
upon conversion  we will deliver to the holder cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and will deliver shares of our common stock for the amount by which the conversion value exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted commonly referred to as net share settlement 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional details concerning the conversion features of the notes and the dilutive effect of the notes in our diluted earnings per share calculation 
we may redeem the notes at any time on or after december  the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes on december    and and for a certain period of time following a change in control 
the redemption price or the repurchase price shall be payable in cash and equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and liquidated damages  if any up to but not including the date of redemption or repurchase 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in the right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness and senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness 
the notes effectively rank junior in the right of payment to any existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured indebtedness 
the notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries 
our subsidiary trusts have issued fixed rate and floating rate trust preferred securities and the trusts have used the proceeds from these offerings to purchase subordinated debentures from us 
we also issued subordinated debentures to the trusts in exchange for all of the common securities of each trust 
the sole assets of the trusts are the subordinated debentures and any interest accrued thereon 
the terms of the preferred securities issued by each trust parallel the terms of the subordinated debentures 
our obligations under the subordinated debentures and related agreements provide a full and unconditional guarantee of payments due under the trust preferred securities 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no

the remaining  shares of these trust preferred securities are convertible into  shares of our common stock 
american equity capital trust ii issued million  shares of trust preferred securities and we issued million of our subordinated debentures 
the consideration received by american equity capital trust ii in connection with the issue of its trust preferred securities consisted of fixed income trust preferred securities of equal value issued by fbl 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a million revolving line of credit with three banks 
there is no amount outstanding under this revolving line of credit at december  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional details concerning the terms of the revolving line of credit 
at december   we had million outstanding under a credit agreement 
all amounts outstanding under this agreement were repaid during stockholders equity in  in connection with a rights offering of shares of our common stock  we issued subscription rights to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to certain officers and directors 
the subscription rights have an exercise price of per share 
during  the board of directors extended the expiration date of the subscription rights from december  to december  and in conjunction therewith  we recognized compensation expense of million 
during  we issued  shares of series a participating preferred stock aggregate liquidation preference of million 
during  all of these shares converted into  shares of our common stock 
prior to conversion  these shares had participating dividend rights with the shares of our common stock  when and as such dividends were declared 
during  we purchased  shares of our common stock at a total cost of million per share 
we issued these shares and  shares held as treasury stock to a rabbi trust established for the benefit of agents who have earned shares of our common stock under the american equity investment nmo deferred compensation plan

liquidity for insurance operations our life subsidiaries generally receive adequate cash flow from premium collections and investment income to meet their obligations 
annuity and life insurance liabilities are generally long term in nature 
policyholders may  however  withdraw funds or surrender their policies  subject to surrender page of and withdrawal penalty provisions 
at december   approximately of our annuity liabilities were subject to penalty upon surrender  with a weighted average remaining surrender charge period of years and a weighted average surrender charge rate of 
we believe that the diversity of our investment portfolio and the concentration of investments in high quality securities provides sufficient liquidity to meet foreseeable cash requirements 
the investment portfolio at december  included billion amortized cost basis of publicly traded available for sale investment grade bonds 
although there is no present need or intent to dispose of such investments  our life subsidiaries could readily liquidate portions of their investments  if such a need arose 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion of the related interest rate risk exposure 
in addition  investments could be used to facilitate borrowings under repurchase agreements 
as indicated above  such borrowings have been used by american equity life from time to time to increase our return on investments 
liquidity of parent company we  as the parent company  are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries  and have no business operations 
we need liquidity primarily to service our debt  including the convertible senior notes and subordinated debentures issued to subsidiary trusts  pay operating expenses and pay dividends to stockholders 
the primary sources of funds for these payments are i investment advisory fees from our life subsidiaries  ii dividends on capital stock and surplus note interest payments from american equity life  iii investment income on our investments  and iv principal and interest payments received on our notes receivable from american equity investment service company see discussion that follows 
these sources provide adequate cash flow to us to meet our current and reasonably foreseeable future obligations 
we may also obtain cash by drawing down our million revolving line of credit or by issuing debt or equity securities 
the payment of dividends or distributions  including surplus note payments  by our life subsidiaries is subject to regulation by each subsidiary s state of domicile s insurance department 
currently  american equity life may pay dividends or make other distributions without the prior approval of its state of domicile s insurance department  unless such payments  together with all other such payments within the preceding twelve months  exceed the greater of american equity life s net gain from operations for the preceding calendar year  or of american equity life s statutory surplus at the preceding december for  up to approximately million can be distributed as dividends by american equity life without prior approval of the iowa insurance division 
in addition  dividends and surplus note payments may be made only out of earned surplus  and all surplus note payments are subject to prior approval by regulatory authorities in the life subsidiary s state of domicile 
american equity life had approximately million of earned surplus at december  the maximum distribution permitted by law or contract is not necessarily indicative of an insurer s actual ability to pay such distributions  which may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations  such as the impact of such distributions on surplus  which could affect the insurer s ratings or competitive position  the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends or make other distributions 
further  state insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory surplus of our life subsidiaries following any dividend or distribution must be reasonable in relation to their outstanding liabilities and adequate for their financial needs 
the transfer of funds by american equity life is also restricted by a covenant in our revolving line of credit agreement which requires american equity life to maintain a minimum risk based capital ratio of 
statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted for our life subsidiaries differ in many respects from those governing the preparation of financial statements under gaap 
accordingly  page of statutory operating results and statutory capital and surplus may differ substantially from amounts reported in the gaap basis financial statements for comparable items 
information as to statutory capital and surplus and statutory net income for our life subsidiaries as of december  and and for the years ended december   and is included in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
american equity life has entered into a general agency commission and servicing agreement with american equity investment service company  or the service company  an affiliated company wholly owned by our chairman  chief executive officer and president  whereby the affiliate acts as a national supervisory agent with responsibility for paying commissions to our agents 
this agreement initially benefits american equity life s statutory surplus by extending the payment of a portion of the first year commissions on new annuity business written by american equity life over a longer period of time  and thereby enabling american equity life to conduct a comparatively greater volume of business 
in subsequent periods  american equity life s statutory surplus is reduced through the payment of renewal commissions to the affiliate on this business based upon the account balances of the annuities remaining in force see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
during the years ended december   and  the service company paid million  million and million  respectively  to agents of american equity life 
american equity life paid renewal commissions to the service company of million  million and million  respectively  during the years ended december   and future payments by american equity life on business in force at december  are dependent upon the account balances of the annuities remaining in force on each remaining quarterly renewal commission payment date 
from time to time the service company has borrowed money from us as a source of funds for the commissions it paid to american equity life s agents 
during  the service company borrowed million from us 
at december  and  the amount receivable from the service company was million and million  respectively 
principal and interest are payable quarterly over five years from the date of the advance 
in the normal course of business  we enter into financing transactions  lease agreements  or other commitments 
these commitments may obligate us to certain cash flows during future periods

pending accounting changes in march  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides guidance regarding the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and to equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
included in eitf is guidance on how to account for impairments that are solely due to interest rate changes  including changes resulting from increases in sector credit spreads 
this guidance was to become effective for reporting periods beginning after june  however  on september   the fasb issued a staff position that delays the effective date for the recognition and measurement guidance of eitf until additional clarifying guidance is issued 
the issuance of this guidance was delayed during the fourth quarter of  with additional discussion of this issue by the fasb planned for we are not able to assess the impact of the adoption of eitf until final guidance is issued 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this standard requires expensing stock options and other share based payments and supersedes sfas no 
 which had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing proforma disclosure only 
this standard is effective for us as of july  and will apply to all awards granted  modified  cancelled or purchased after that date as well as the unvested portion of prior awards 
we will adopt the standard as of the effective date and do not believe it will have a material effect on our financial statements 
inflation inflation does not have a significant effect on our balance sheet 
we have minimal investments in property  equipment or inventories 
to the extent that interest rates may change to reflect inflation or inflation expectations  there would be an effect on our balance sheet and operations 
higher interest rates experienced in recent periods have decreased the value of our fixed maturity investments 
it is likely that declining interest rates would have the opposite effect 
it is not possible to calculate the effect such changes in interest rates  if any  have had on our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to invest our available funds in a manner that will maximize shareholder value and fund future obligations to policyholders and debtors  subject to appropriate risk considerations 
we seek to meet this objective through investments that i consist predominately of investment grade fixed maturity securities  ii have projected returns which satisfy our spread targets  and iii have characteristics which support the underlying liabilities 
many of our products incorporate surrender charges  market interest rate adjustments or other features to encourage persistency 
page of we seek to maximize the total return on our available for sale investments through active investment management 
accordingly  we have determined that our available for sale portfolio of fixed maturity securities is available to be sold in response to i changes in market interest rates  ii changes in relative values of individual securities and asset sectors  iii changes in prepayment risks  iv changes in credit quality outlook for certain securities  v liquidity needs  and vi other factors 
we have a portfolio of held for investment securities which consists principally of long duration bonds issued by us government agencies 
these securities are purchased to secure long term yields which meet our spread targets and support the underlying liabilities 
interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure 
substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the profitability of our products  the amount of interest we pay on our subordinated debentures payable  and the market value of our investments 
our floating rate trust preferred securities issued by trusts iii  iv  vii  and viii bear interest at the three month libor plus 
our outstanding balance of floating rate trust preferred securities at december  was million 
the profitability of most of our products depends on the spreads between interest yield on investments and rates credited on insurance liabilities 
we have the ability to adjust crediting rates participation or asset fee rates for index annuities on substantially all of our annuity policies at least annually subject to minimum guaranteed values 
in addition  substantially all of our annuity products have surrender and withdrawal penalty provisions designed to encourage persistency and to help ensure targeted spreads are earned 
however  competitive factors  including the impact of the level of surrenders and withdrawals  may limit our ability to adjust or maintain crediting rates at levels necessary to avoid narrowing of spreads under certain market conditions 
a major component of our interest rate risk management program is structuring the investment portfolio with cash flow characteristics consistent with the cash flow characteristics of our insurance liabilities 
we use computer models to simulate cash flows expected from our existing business under various interest rate scenarios 
these simulations enable us to measure the potential gain or loss in fair value of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments  to evaluate the adequacy of expected cash flows from our assets to meet the expected cash requirements of our liabilities and to determine if it is necessary to lengthen or shorten the average life and duration of our investment portfolio 
the duration of a security is the time weighted present value of the security s expected cash flows and is used to measure a security s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
when the durations of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is minimized because a change in value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would decrease by approximately million 
the impact on stockholders equity of such decrease net of income taxes and certain adjustments for changes in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements would be an increase of million in the accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the computer models used to estimate the impact of a change in market interest rates incorporate numerous assumptions  require significant estimates and assume an immediate and parallel change in interest rates without any management of the investment portfolio in reaction to such change 
consequently  potential changes in value of our financial instruments indicated by the simulations will likely be different from the actual changes experienced under given interest rate scenarios  and the differences may be material 
because we actively manage our investments and liabilities  our net exposure to interest rates can vary over time 
however  any such decreases in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities unless related to credit concerns of the issuer requiring recognition of an other than temporary impairment would generally be realized only if we were required to sell such securities at losses prior to the their maturity to meet our liquidity needs  which we manage using the surrender and withdrawal provisions of our annuity contracts and through other means as discussed earlier 
see financial condition liquidity for insurance operations for a further discussion of the liquidity risk 
page of at december   of our fixed income securities have call features and were subject to call redemption 
another will become subject to call redemption through december  during the years ended december  and  we received billion and billion  respectively  in net redemption proceeds related to the exercise of such call options 
we have reinvestment risk related to these redemptions to the extent we cannot reinvest the net proceeds in assets with credit quality and yield characteristics similar to the redeemed bonds 
such reinvestment risk typically occurs in a declining rate environment 
should rates decline to levels which tighten the spread between our average portfolio yield and average cost of interest credited on our annuity liabilities  we have the ability to reduce crediting rates on most of our annuity liabilities to maintain the spread at our targeted level 
at december   approximately of our annuity liabilities are subject to annual adjustment of the applicable crediting rates at our discretion  limited by minimum guaranteed crediting rates of to 
with respect to our index annuities  we purchase call options on the applicable indices to fund the annual index credits on such annuities 
these options are primarily one year instruments purchased to match the funding requirements of the underlying policies 
proceeds received at expiration of the call options are substantially offset by an increase in the amounts added to policyholder account balances for index products 
for the years ended december  and  index credits to policyholders on their anniversaries were million and million  respectively 
proceeds received at expiration of these options related to such credits were million and million  respectively 
the difference between proceeds received at expiration of these options and index credits for is primarily due to credits attributable to minimum guaranteed interest self funded by us 
during  we refined our hedging process to purchase options out of the money to the extent of anticipated minimum guaranteed interest on index policies 
on the anniversary dates of the index policies  we purchase new one year call options to fund the next annual index credits 
the risk associated with these prospective purchases is the uncertainty of the cost  which will determine whether we are able to earn our spread on our index business 
this is a risk we attempt to manage through the terms of our index annuities  which permit us to change annual participation rates  asset fees  and caps  subject to contractual features 
by modifying participation rates  asset fees or caps  we can limit option costs to budgeted amounts  except in cases where the contractual features would prevent further modifications 
based upon actuarial testing which we conduct as a part of the design of our index products and on an ongoing basis  we believe the risk that contractual features would prevent us from controlling option costs is not material
