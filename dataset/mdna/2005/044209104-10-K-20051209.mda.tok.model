m results of operations ashland s net income amounted to  million in  million in and million in income from continuing operations which excludes discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to  million in  million in and million in results for included a net gain of  million from the map transaction and a related loss on the early retirement of debt  as described in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
ashland s results from discontinued operations  consisting of charges associated with estimated future asbestos liabilities less probable insurance recoveries  as well as net income from the discontinued operations of its electronic chemicals business  along with the cumulative effect of accounting changes adopted in  accounted for the difference in net income and income from continuing operations 
chemical sector consisting of ashland distribution  ashland specialty chemical and valvoline operating income totaled million in  compared to million in and million in ashland distribution and ashland specialty chemical both reported record performances for on the strength of increased sales and operating revenues  while valvoline s results declined from the record performance  reflecting a decrease in lubricant sales volumes 
the transportation construction sector  commercially known as ashland paving and construction  inc apac  recorded operating income of million in  compared to income of million in and a loss of million in apac s decline in reflected an active hurricane and tropical storm season  which caused work disruptions and rapid increases in raw material and energy costs 
refining and marketing operating income was million in  compared to million in and million in the results reflect nine months of equity income from ashland s ownership interest in map through june   when ashland transferred its interest in map to marathon as described in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an analysis of operating income by industry segment follows 
apac operating income from apac totaled million in  compared to million in weather delays due to the highly active hurricane and tropical storm season affected apac s key summer construction season  and hot mix asphalt production  a key source of profits  declined versus the prior year 
given the fixed nature of many of apac s costs  volume declines disproportionately reduce earnings 
in addition  rapidly rising raw material and energy costs throughout the year outpaced price increases and affected profits on fixed price contracts 
equity income from an atlanta airport runway project declined by million as that job was completed in  while gains on asset sales were million lower in in  apac reversed into income a million reserve for liquidated damages established in related to a large highway construction project in virginia 
in addition  the provision for job loss reserves was million higher in versus  partially as a result of higher raw material and energy costs in fixed price backlog 
partially offsetting these negative effects was an million increase in gains on hedges of gasoline and diesel fuel costs 
as of september   apac s construction backlog  which consists of contracts awarded and funded but not yet performed  was billion  up compared to operating income from apac totaled million in  compared with an operating loss of million in higher margins on construction work  driven primarily by reduced operating costs  was the primary contributor to the earnings improvement 
income also increased from the sale of hot mix asphalt and aggregates  reflecting improved pricing and margins as well as slightly higher sales volumes in both areas 
operating efficiency increased as a result of broad based business improvement programs implemented between and  and somewhat better weather conditions for overall  compared with the record levels of rainfall experienced in apac reversed into income a million reserve for liquidated damages established in related to a large highway construction project in virginia 
also contributing to earnings  apac sold a significant portion of its ready mix concrete operations in the june quarter  realizing proceeds net of selling expenses of million and a pretax gain of million 
costs related to project pass  apac s process redesign initiative completed during  amounted to million in  compared with million in ashland distribution ashland distribution reported record operating income of million in  a improvement compared with million in during the september quarter  ashland distribution delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of record operating income and th consecutive record sales month 
sales and operating revenues increased compared with  reflecting increased selling prices  as total volumes declined due to one less shipping day and the disposition of the ingestibles business 
adjusting for the ingestibles disposition  sales volumes were up on a per day basis 
gross profit as a percent of sales increased slightly  from to m  demonstrating the division s success in passing through rising raw material costs and by aggressively managing expenses 
environmental remediation expenses increased million compared to ashland distribution generated operating income of million in  compared with million in sales increased compared with  due to a increase in unit volumes and a increase in selling prices 
gross profit as a percent of sales declined slightly  from to  attributable primarily to lower margins within the chemicals product category 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined  reflecting cost cutting and efficiency improvements achieved through ashland s top quartile cost structure tqcs program that began in income in increased from all regions  both domestically and in europe 
ashland specialty chemical operating income from ashland specialty chemical increased to a record million in  a improvement compared to million in sales and operating revenues increased  while gross profit as a percent of sales declined from to  as raw material costs escalated at a faster pace than could be recovered through increased selling prices 
revenues from the performance materials businesses casting solutions  composite polymers and specialty polymers adhesives increased  reflecting higher selling prices and increased volumes resulting primarily from the december acquisition of the derakane r resins business 
revenues from the water technologies businesses drew industrial and drew marine increased  reflecting increased sales volumes 
results for included approximately million in net  non recurring gains principally related to the termination of a product supply contract and a million pretax gain on the sale of an idle plant in plaquemine  louisiana 
results for included a million pretax gain on the sale of a parcel of land and other fixed assets at the same location 
environmental remediation expenses were million higher in compared to operating income from ashland specialty chemical increased to million in  compared to million in sales from the performance materials businesses increased  reflecting an increase in unit sales volumes and a increase in selling prices 
the increase in sales was partially offset by a decline in gross profit percentage due to the inability to fully recover persistently rising raw materials costs 
the water technologies businesses achieved higher income as a result of a increase in revenues 
ashland specialty chemical s selling  general and administrative expenses were reduced in  reflecting cost reductions achieved through ashland s tqcs program 
adding to income in  a parcel of land and fixed assets in plaquemine  louisiana were sold for net proceeds of million  resulting in a pretax gain of million 
results for included an impairment charge of million for a maleic anhydride production facility  as well as a charge of million for staff reductions under the tqcs program 
valvoline valvoline reported operating income of million in  a decline compared with the record million reported in the reduction in earnings resulted from an decrease in lubricant sales volumes  reflecting deep competitive discounting and a decline in the us branded lubricant market  and rapidly rising raw material costs 
earnings from valvoline instant oil change vioc decreased due to the sale of vioc centers to marathon in the map transaction on june   and a decrease in the number of oil changes 
partially offsetting these decreases were record results from valvoline s international operations  which increased compared to on the strength of improved results in europe and latin america 
at september   vioc operated company owned service centers  compared to centers in and centers in the vioc franchising program continues to expand  with centers open at september   compared to centers in and centers in valvoline generated record operating income of million in  compared with million in lubricant sales volumes decreased from  but unit sales of higher margin premium lubricants maxlife  durablend and synpower increased 
vioc reported its third year of record earnings due in part to a increase in non oil change revenues and a increase in premium oil changes  contributing to a increase in the average sale per customer visit 
valvoline s international operations posted record operating income in  mostly due to a increase in lubricant sales volumes and strengthening foreign currencies 
refining and marketing operating income from refining and marketing  which consisted primarily of equity income from ashland s ownership interest in map through june   amounted to million in  compared to million in equity income from map s refining and marketing operations for the nine months ended m june  was million higher than for all of  reflecting an increase of per barrel in its refining and wholesale marketing margin 
equity income from map s retail operations speedway superamerica and a interest in the pilot travel centers joint venture for the nine months ended june  was million higher than for all of  reflecting higher merchandise margins 
equity income from map s transportation operations for the nine months ended june  was million lower than for all of  reflecting the three less months of operations during ashland s period of ownership 
ashland s environmental remediation expenses for former refining and marketing sites  including those conveyed to map for which ashland retained remediation obligations  amounted to million in  versus income of million in resulting from reductions in estimated reserves 
operating income from refining and marketing was million in  compared to million in equity income from map s refining and marketing operations increased million  reflecting an increase of cents per barrel in its refining and wholesale marketing margin 
map s refineries processed approximately million barrels per day of crude oil and other feedstocks during  an increase of from equity income from map s retail operations declined million due to an million gain on the sale of speedway superamerica s southern stores in corporate corporate expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in reflected million in charges for estimated future insurance premiums due oil insurance limited oil  the energy industry mutual insurance consortium in which ashland participates 
the increase in future premiums was the result of a higher level of losses than anticipated for the members of oil  due primarily to the effects of hurricanes and tropical storms 
ashland has given notice to oil that it will terminate its participation effective december   and the increased premiums will be payable upon withdrawal from oil 
these estimates may change as additional information becomes available and oil calculates the final withdrawal premium 
also contributing to the increase in corporate expenses for was a million increase in environmental remediation expenses primarily related to former businesses other than chemical and refining and marketing operations 
in addition  accruals for performance based employee incentive plans and stock incentive plans were million higher in the reduction in corporate expenses for compared to reflected an increase in of million related to performance based employee incentive plans  which was more than offset by the inclusion in of million in severance and other transition costs related to ashland s tqcs and other cost reduction programs 
gain on the map transaction see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the map transaction and the resulting pretax gain of  million recorded in loss on early retirement of debt see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the early retirement of debt associated with the map transaction  which resulted in a pretax loss of million recorded in net interest and other financial costs the following table summarizes the components of net interest and other financial costs 
in millions net interest and other financial costs interest expense expenses on sales of accounts receivable other financial costs interest income ashland s long term debt declined from billion at september  to million at the end of fiscal  accounting for a reduction in interest expense of million in and an additional million in as described in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements  ashland repaid most of its outstanding debt and certain other financial obligations with the proceeds of the map transaction 
interest and other financial costs of m million in will not be incurred in future periods because of the repayments 
interest income increased million in  with most of that increase due to the recognition of interest income associated with income tax refunds claimed for prior years 
interest income increased million in  primarily reflecting the investment of remaining cash proceeds from the map transaction in the september quarter 
income taxes as described in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements  ashland s income tax benefit for included a benefit of million associated with the map transaction  resulting from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities 
also as described in note d  the pretax gain of  million was non taxable to ashland 
ashland s income tax benefit for also included million in tax benefits related to prior years 
these benefits resulted primarily from a favorable settlement with the internal revenue service irs for the audit period and the reevaluation of income tax reserves related to other years 
ashland s income tax expense for included million in tax benefits related to prior years 
during the year  ashland reached resolution with the irs on several open tax matters from prior years  resulting in a tax benefit of million as a result of the reduction of amounts previously provided as contingent tax liabilities 
in addition  ashland recognized federal income tax benefits associated with a claim for additional research and development tax credits valued at million 
excluding these identified items  ashland s adjusted effective tax rate was in  compared to in and in the overall effective rate was lower in than in and due to ashland s lower level of earnings in and the resulting larger relative portion of those earnings derived from income taxed at less than full us statutory rates 
discontinued operations and accounting changes results of ashland s discontinued operations are summarized below 
see note p of notes to consolidated financial statements for an explanation of these amounts 
in millions income loss from discontinued operations net of tax asbestos related litigation reserves and expenses electronic chemicals results of operations gain loss on sale of operations resolution of tax contingency issues as discussed in note a of notes to consolidated financial statements  as of july   ashland consolidated a lessor entity in its financial statements under fin  and doing so resulted in an after tax charge of million to adjust the depreciation included in the cumulative lease payments to conform to ashland s depreciation methods 
financial position liquidity cash flows from operations  a major source of ashland s liquidity  amounted to million in  million in and million in such amounts include cash distributions from map of million in  million in and million in during  ashland paid income taxes of million  compared with million in and million in ashland also contributed million to its qualified pension plans in  compared with million in and million in reflected in cash flows from operations for was the repurchase of million of accounts receivable previously sold under ashland s sale of receivables facility 
cash flows from operations during were supplemented by billion in proceeds from the map transaction and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulting from stock option exercises 
cash flows from operations during were supplemented by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulting from stock option exercises  as well as million from the sale of certain apac operations 
after using a portion of the map transaction proceeds to retire most of its debt and certain other financial obligations  ashland had billion of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities at september  m ashland s financial position has enabled it to obtain capital for its financing needs 
following shareholder approval of the map transaction in june  moody s lowered ashland s senior debt rating from baa to ba  their highest non investment grade rating  and also lowered ashland s commercial paper rating from p to n p not prime  citing the annual cash flow lost from the operations sold 
in september  standard poor s lowered ashland s senior debt rating from bbb to bbb  its lowest investment grade rating  and lowered ashland s commercial paper rating from a to a ratings downgrades below investment grade can significantly increase a company s borrowing costs 
ashland has a revolving credit agreement that expires on march   which provides for up to million in borrowings 
the borrowing capacity under this facility was reduced by million of letters of credit outstanding at september  while the revolving credit agreement contains a covenant limiting new borrowings based on ashland s stockholders equity  the agreement would have permitted an additional billion of borrowings at september  additional permissible borrowings are increased decreased by of any increase decrease in stockholders equity 
at september   working capital excluding debt due within one year amounted to  million  compared to million at the end of ashland s working capital is affected by its use of the lifo method of inventory valuation 
that method valued inventories below their replacement costs by million at september  and million at september  liquid assets cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and accounts receivable amounted to of current liabilities at september   compared to at the end of these increases reflect the cash proceeds from the map transaction net of debt repayments 
capital resources on july   ashland s board of directors authorized the purchase of million of ashland common stock in the open market 
through september   ashland had repurchased million shares at a cost of million 
property additions amounted to million during the last three years and are summarized in the information by industry segment on page f property additions included buyouts of operating leases of million in and million in for the past three years  apac accounted for of ashland s capital expenditures  while ashland specialty chemical accounted for and valvoline accounted for 
capital used for acquisitions amounted to million during the last three years  of which million was invested in apac  million in ashland distribution  million in ashland specialty chemical and million in valvoline 
a summary of the capital employed in ashland s operations follows 
the decrease in capital employed in refining and marketing in reflects the map transaction 
in millions capital employed apac   ashland distribution ashland specialty chemical valvoline refining and marketing   during  ashland reduced its total debt by  million to million and stockholders equity increased by  million to billion  both primarily as a result of the map transaction 
increases resulting from  million of net income  million from issuance of common shares under stock incentive and other plans  and million of translation gains associated with foreign operations were partially offset by the distribution of marathon shares from the map transaction of million  common stock repurchases of million  cash dividends of million  a million increase in the minimum pension liability and million in unrealized losses on cash flow hedges 
debt as a percent of capital employed was reduced from at the end of to at september  during  ashland expects capital expenditures of approximately million compared with million in the decline reflects decreases for apac and valvoline  which included most of the million in lease buyouts in  and increases for ashland distribution and ashland specialty chemical 
in  ashland initiated a multi year sap enterprise resource planning erp project that is expected to be implemented world wide across ashland s chemical sector to achieve increased efficiency and effectiveness in supply chain  financial  and environmental  health and safety processes 
overall costs for this project through are expected to total approximately million  of which approximately million will be capitalized  including million of m capitalized costs expected to be spent in while extensive planning is underway to support a smooth implementation of the erp system  such implementations carry substantial project risk  including the potential for business interruption and associated adverse impacts on operating results 
the following table aggregates ashland s commitments to make future payments under existing contracts at september  contractual cash obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable have been excluded 
later in millions total years contractual obligations obligations to construction subcontractors raw material purchase obligations employee benefit obligations a operating lease obligations long term debt b total contractual obligations  a includes estimated funding of ashland s qualified us and us pension plans for  as well as projected benefit payments through under ashland s nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
see note q of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
b includes principal and interest payments 
capitalized lease obligations are not significant and are included in long term debt 
off balance sheet arrangements ashland and its subsidiaries are lessees of office buildings  retail outlets  transportation and off road construction equipment  warehouses and storage facilities  and other equipment  facilities and properties under leasing agreements that expire at various dates 
capitalized lease obligations are not significant and are included in long term debt 
in june  ashland used million of the proceeds from the map transaction to purchase assets primarily apac construction equipment and vioc stores formerly leased under operating leases 
future minimum rental payments were not affected by this purchase 
on march   ashland entered into a five year agreement to sell  on an ongoing basis with limited recourse  up to a million undivided interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable 
under the terms of the agreement  new receivables were added to the pool and collections reduced the pool 
ashland retained a credit interest in these receivables and addressed its risk of loss on this retained interest in its allowance for doubtful accounts 
receivables sold excluded defaulted accounts or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer 
on march   this agreement was extended for a period of one year and the capacity was increased to million 
the agreement was terminated by ashland on july  application of critical accounting policies the preparation of ashland s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include long lived assets  employee benefit obligations  income taxes  reserves and associated receivables for asbestos litigation  environmental remediation  and income recognized under construction contracts 
although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the audit committee of ashland s board of directors 
long lived assets the cost of plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are based on historical experience and are adjusted when changes in planned use  technological advances or other factors show that a different life would be more appropriate 
such costs are periodically reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present 
such indicators include  among other factors  operating m losses  unused capacity  market value declines and technological obsolescence 
recorded values of property  plant and equipment that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value  which generally is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows assets held for use or net realizable value assets held for sale 
during  ashland recognized an impairment charge of million for a maleic anhydride production facility that is shut down and not likely to reopen based on internal analyses 
although circumstances can change considerably over time  ashland is not aware of any impairment indicators that would necessitate periodic reviews on any significant asset within property  plant and equipment at september intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of ashland s reporting units  which generally are synonymous with its industry segments 
however  the individual operating divisions of ashland specialty chemical are also considered reporting units under fas since market prices of ashland s reporting units are not readily available  management makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those units 
fair values are based principally on ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiples of peer group companies for each of these reporting units 
ashland recognized impairment charges of million in and million in for goodwill associated with non strategic businesses of apac identified for sale 
ashland did not recognize any goodwill impairment during the most recent annual impairment tests indicated that the fair values of each of ashland s reporting units with significant goodwill were in excess of their carrying values by at least  and the consolidated fair values exceeded carrying values by more than 
despite that excess  however  impairment charges could still be required if a divestiture decision were made with respect to a particular business included in one of the reporting units 
employee benefit obligations ashland and its subsidiaries sponsor contributory and noncontributory qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees in the united states and in a number of other countries 
benefits under these plans generally are based on employees years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding their retirement 
in addition  the companies also sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans  which provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees who retire or are disabled 
retiree contributions to ashland s health care plans are adjusted periodically  and the plans contain other cost sharing features  such as deductibles and coinsurance 
life insurance plans generally are noncontributory 
as of september   ashland revised certain of its demographic assumptions used to determine its pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
the mortality assumption was changed from the group annuity mortality table for males set back six years for females to the rp table for healthy lives in order to reflect longer life expectancies 
in addition  the turnover assumption was changed to rates based on actual plan experience for the years through the previous turnover assumption was based on actual plan experience through these changes are effective as of september  for disclosure purposes and for expense 
current retirement rates based on actual plan experience were not revised 
the assumption study recently performed indicated that the assumption was appropriate 
the principal economic assumptions used to determine ashland s pension and other postretirement benefit costs are the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
because ashland s retiree health care plans contain various caps that limit ashland s contributions and because medical inflation is expected to continue at a rate in excess of these caps for the immediate future  the health care cost trend rate has no material impact on ashland s postretirement health care benefit costs 
beginning september   ashland developed the discount rate used to determine the present value of its obligations under the us pension and postretirement health and life plans by matching the stream of benefit payments from the plans to the citigroup pension discount curve spot rates 
ashland changed to this approach to better reflect the specific cash flows of these plans in determining the discount rate 
the discount rate determined as of september  was for the us pension plans and for the postretirement health and life plans 
non us pension plans followed a similar process based on financial markets in those countries where ashland provides a defined benefit pension plan 
previously  the discount rate for us pension plans was based on the moody s aa corporate bond index  adjusted for longer durations of the pension plans as compared to the shorter duration of the index  and also adjusted to convert the semi annual coupons in the index to an annual discount rate 
this adjusted rate was then rounded to the nearest basis points  which resulted in a discount rate of as of september  ashland s expense under these plans is determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which amounted to for for the pension plans  for the first seven months of the fiscal year for the postretirement health plans and for the final five months of the fiscal year as a result of the m may  remeasurement reflecting the amendment to the prescription drug benefit of the health care plans for retirees age or older 
historically  the discount rates used for expense were for and for the expense for the pension plans will be based on a discount rate of  while will be used for the postretirement health and life plans 
the rate of compensation increase assumptions were for  for and for the long term expected rate of return on assets was assumed to be in  in and in the return on plan assets is subject to wide year to year variances 
for  the pension plan assets generated an actual return of  compared to in and in however  the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption  and actual returns will be subject to considerable year to year variances 
ashland has generated compounded annual investment returns of and on its pension plan assets over the last five year and ten year periods 
shown below are the estimated increases in pension and postretirement expense that would have resulted from a change in each of the assumptions for each of the last three years 
in millions increase in pensions costs from decrease in the discount rate increase in the salary adjustment rate decrease in the expected return on plan assets increase in other postretirement costs from decrease in the discount rate income taxes ashland is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining ashland s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of ashland s business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
ashland is regularly under audit by tax authorities 
accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
although ashland believes it has appropriate support for the positions taken on tax returns  a liability has been recorded that represents ashland s best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions 
ashland believes that the recorded accruals for all known tax liabilities are adequate for all open years  based on the assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
although ashland believes the recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain 
therefore  ashland s assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
although ashland believes that the estimates and assumptions supporting its assessments are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on ashland s income tax provision  net income  or cash flows could result in the period such a determination is made 
due to the complexity involved  ashland is not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded 
asbestos related litigation ashland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
such claims result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in in connection with the sale of riley stoker corporation riley  a former subsidiary 
although riley was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos  its industrial boilers contained some asbestos containing components provided by other companies 
during the december quarter  ashland increased its reserve for asbestos claims by million to cover the litigation defense and claim settlement costs for probable and reasonably estimable future payments related to existing open claims  as well as an estimate of those that may be filed in the future 
prior to december   the asbestos reserve was based on the estimated costs that would be incurred to settle existing open claims 
a range of estimates of future asbestos claims and related costs using various assumptions was developed with the assistance of hamilton  rabinovitz alschuler  inc hr a 
the methodology used by hr a to project future asbestos costs was based largely on ashland s recent experience  including claim filing and settlement rates  disease mix  open claims  and litigation defense and claim settlement costs 
ashland s claim experience was compared to the results of previously conducted epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos related m diseases 
those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos 
using that information  hr a estimated a range of the number of future claims that may be filed  as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims 
from the range of estimates  ashland recorded the amount it believed to be the best estimate  which represented the expected payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs during the next ten years 
subsequent updates to this estimate have been made  with the assistance of hr a  based on a combination of a number of factors including the actual volume of new claims  recent settlement costs  changes in the mix of alleged disease  enacted legislative changes and other developments impacting ashland s estimate of future payments 
ashland s reserve for asbestos claims on an undiscounted basis amounted to million at september   compared to million at september  projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict 
in addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received  other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  ashland believes its asbestos reserve represents the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes 
as a part of the process to develop ashland s estimates of future asbestos costs  a range of long term cost models is developed that assumes a run out of claims through these models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs  as well as other variables mentioned previously 
the total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an undiscounted basis has been estimated within a reasonably possible range of million to billion  depending on the number of years those costs extend and other combinations of assumptions selected 
if actual experience is worse than projected relative to the number of claims filed  the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims  ashland may need to increase further the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could potentially be material over time 
ashland has insurance coverage for most of the litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims  and coverage in place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide substantially all of the coverage currently being accessed 
as a result  increases in the asbestos reserve have been largely offset by probable insurance recoveries 
the amounts not recoverable generally are due from insurers that are insolvent  rather than as a result of uninsured claims or the exhaustion of ashland s insurance coverage 
ashland retained the services of tillinghast towers perrin to assist management in estimating the value of reasonably possible insurance recoveries associated with ashland s estimate of its asbestos liabilities 
such recoveries are based on management s assumptions and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage 
one such assumption is that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent 
although coverage limits are resolved in the coverage in place agreement with equitas limited equitas and other london companies  which collectively provide a significant portion of ashland s insurance coverage for asbestos claims  there is a disagreement with these companies over the timing of recoveries 
the resolution of this disagreement could have a material effect on the value of insurance recoveries from those companies 
in estimating the value of future recoveries  ashland has used the least favorable interpretation of this agreement under which the ultimate recoveries are extended for many years  resulting in a significant discount being applied to value those recoveries 
ashland will continue to apply this methodology until such time as the disagreement is resolved 
on july   ashland filed a demand for arbitration to resolve the dispute concerning the interpretation of this agreement 
at september   ashland s receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from its insurers amounted to million  of which million relates to costs previously paid 
receivables from insurance companies amounted to million at september  approximately of the estimated receivables from insurance companies at september  are expected to be due from equitas and other london companies 
of the remainder  approximately is expected to come from companies or groups that are rated a or higher by a

environmental remediation ashland is subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts collectively environmental remediation at multiple locations 
at m september   such locations included waste treatment or disposal sites where ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under superfund or similar state laws  current and former operating facilities including certain operating facilities conveyed to map and about  service station properties  of which are being actively remediated 
ashland s reserves for environmental remediation amounted to million at september  and million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  were classified in noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the total reserves for environmental remediation reflect ashland s estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable  without regard to any third party recoveries 
engineering studies  probability techniques  historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation 
environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect ashland s ability to estimate its share of the costs 
such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site  the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations  widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods  changes in environmental regulations  the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology  and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites 
ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues 
environmental remediation expense amounted to million in  million in and million in no individual remediation location is material to ashland as its largest reserve for any site is less than of the remediation reserve 
as a result  ashland s exposure to adverse developments with respect to any individual site is not expected to be material  and these sites are in various stages of ongoing remediation 
although environmental remediation could have a material effect on results of operations if a series of adverse developments occurs in a particular quarter or fiscal year  ashland believes that the chance of such developments occurring in the same quarter or fiscal year is remote 
construction contracts income related to construction contracts generally is recognized by the units of production method  which is a variation of the percentage of completion method 
construction jobs by their very nature are subject to numerous risks that could create variances from expectations 
such risks include changes in raw material and other costs  adverse weather conditions and the performance of subcontractors and other entities 
income is only certain after a job is completed  and the extent of completion can be difficult to assess in certain circumstances 
the extent of completion for each production phase is determined by reference to material quantities  labor hours  subcontract costs or other factors that are believed to be most indicative of the progress made under each phase of a project 
revenues earned are computed by reference to the contract or detailed analyses of revenues and expenses by production phase that supported the related construction contract or bid proposal 
these detailed analyses also serve as early indicators as to whether a construction contract may ultimately be completed at a loss 
any anticipated losses on such contracts are charged against operations as soon as such losses are determined to be probable and estimable 
in  reserves of million were established for job losses related to a large highway construction project in virginia  reflecting weather related cost increases and construction delays resulting from record levels of rainfall 
in  million of that reserve  which was the amount that had been provided for potential liquidated damages  was reversed into income when it was determined that those damages would not apply 
assumptions concerning the extent of completion can have a significant effect on the income recognized on an individual construction project in any period 
however  the effects of individual assumptions on apac s reported results are mitigated to some extent by the significant number of jobs in various stages of completion at any point in time 
outlook ashland has four primary goals in fiscal to integrate the chemical sector  to improve the performance of the transportation construction sector  to employ the proceeds from the map transaction in a value creating manner and to generate cash flow 
to achieve sustained profitable growth  ashland must leverage efficiencies throughout its chemical businesses and across its range of customers and suppliers 
therefore  ashland s supply chain must be global  highly adaptive and technology enabled 
in october  ashland successfully launched the first phase of its enterprise resource planning system  globalone  in canada 
globalone is intended to provide the chemical sector with uniformity  m transparency and leverage across the supply chain  thereby reducing administrative and transit costs and working capital 
most important  this common system should enable seamless  efficient and effective processing of customer orders for any chemical sector product 
the objective of globalone s implementation is to provide superior customer service while increasing efficiencies in purchasing  manufacturing and delivery processes 
to be successful  apac must achieve operational excellence in both the construction services and construction materials components of its business 
the ability to schedule properly  manage project costs from initiation to completion and optimize the use of material  equipment and personnel will drive construction services profits 
in addition  apac must manage its asphalt and aggregate plants more efficiently and achieve higher production levels 
finally  apac is carefully analyzing the profitability of each of its markets and assessing their future potential 
the primary objective is to grow apac s bottom line  even if this results in a smaller construction business 
at september   apac s backlog of work awarded and funded  but not yet performed  totaled billion  ahead of the major projects group won three significant projects in  representing approximately of the total backlog 
a hedging program was initiated in march  partially protecting apac s backlog against escalating gasoline and diesel fuel costs on a go forward basis 
steps have been taken to establish consistent  effective processes that should make apac more efficient 
key improvement areas have been identified for apac 
focus is increasing on selling aggregates and hot mix asphalt to third parties 
also  when these construction materials are used in apac s construction jobs  the focus is on capturing their market value in the construction bids 
finally  apac is reflecting rising energy and raw material costs in its pricing models 
ultimately  in a business driven by being the low bidder  apac must be operationally excellent to keep projects on track and finish on time safely  under budget and with high quality for its customers 
the map transaction put ashland in a solid financial position 
with the proceeds  most of ashland s debt was retired creating a strong balance sheet 
ashland is now carefully considering opportunities to deploy the proceeds in value creating ways 
as acquisitions are considered  teams are identifying different markets  channels and customers all with the goal of strengthening ashland s core businesses  leveraging its capabilities and achieving its financial objectives 
ashland is looking beyond us borders to emerging growth markets 
an important determinant of the value of a business is its ability to generate cash flow over time 
ashland s goal is to drive sustainable cash flow from its portfolio across an economic cycle 
the goal will be pursued by driving profit growth from ashland s businesses and improving efficiency from its capital assets 
ashland s sales and operating revenues are normally subject to seasonal variations 
although apac normally enjoys a relatively long construction season  most of its operating income is generated during the construction period of may through october 
the following table compares operating income by quarter for the three years ended september   excluding refining and marketing operations  to illustrate the historical seasonality of ashland s remaining four wholly owned businesses 
amounts for each quarter do not necessarily total to results for the year due to rounding 
in millions quarterly operating income loss december march june september effects of inflation and changing prices ashland s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting and  as a result  do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the us dollar 
although annual inflation rates have been low in recent years  ashland s results are still affected by the cumulative inflationary trend from prior years 
certain of the industries in which ashland operates are capital intensive  and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would exceed their historical costs 
accordingly  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs 
however  since replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies  such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities  mitigating part of the increased expense 
m ashland uses the lifo method to value a substantial portion of its inventories to provide a better matching of revenues with current costs 
however  lifo values such inventories below their replacement costs 
monetary assets such as cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivable lose purchasing power as a result of inflation  while monetary liabilities such as accounts payable and indebtedness result in a gain  because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power 
ashland s monetary assets now exceed its monetary liabilities  leaving it more exposed to the effects of future inflation than in the past  when that relationship was reversed 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis md a contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  with respect to ashland s operating performance 
these estimates are based upon a number of assumptions  including those mentioned within md a 
such estimates are also based upon internal forecasts and analyses of current and future market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  weather  operating efficiencies and economic conditions  such as prices  supply and demand  cost of raw materials  and legal proceedings and claims including environmental and asbestos matters 
although ashland believes its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  it cannot assure the expectations reflected herein will be achieved 
this forward looking information may prove to be inaccurate and actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated if one or more of the underlying assumptions or expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized or if other unexpected conditions or events occur 
other factors and risks affecting ashland are contained in risks and uncertainties in note a of notes to consolidated financial statements and in item a of this annual report on form k 
ashland undertakes no obligation to subsequently update or revise these forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ashland regularly uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its exposure to price fluctuations associated with the purchase of diesel fuel and gasoline  as well as certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows 
gains and losses related to a hedge are either recognized in income immediately to offset the gain or loss on the hedged item  or deferred and recorded in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet as a component of total comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in net income when the hedged item affects net income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a hedge is recognized in income immediately 
ashland has designated a limited portion of its foreign currency derivatives as qualifying for hedge accounting treatment  but their impact on the consolidated financial statements is not significant 
credit risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts  but exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts 
ashland further minimizes this credit risk through internal monitoring procedures and as of september  does not have significant credit risk on open derivative contracts 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in commodity prices or foreign currency rates on ashland s open commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments at september  would not significantly affect ashland s consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or liquidity
