since acquiring our first four stores in  we have expanded into a national chain operating stores in states under the rex trade name 
by offering a broad selection of brand name products at guaranteed lowest prices  we believe we have become a leading consumer electronics appliance retailer in our markets 
our comparable store sales declined   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe our comparable store sales have been adversely affected by the economy  price deflation in certain categories and the increasing competitive environment 
we consider a store to be comparable after it has been open six full fiscal quarters 
comparable store sales comparisons do not include sales of extended service contracts 
extended service contracts our extended service contract revenues  net of sales commissions  are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the contracts after the expiration of applicable manufacturers warranty periods 
terms of coverage  including the manufacturers warranty periods  are usually for periods of to months 
extended service contract revenues represented of net sales for fiscal  of net sales for fiscal and of net sales for fiscal service contract costs are charged to operations as incurred 
gross profit realized from extended service contract revenues was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
investment in synthetic fuel partnerships in fiscal  we invested in two limited partnerships which owned four facilities producing synthetic fuel 
the partnerships earn federal income tax credits under section of the internal revenue code based on the tonnage and content of solid synthetic fuel produced and sold to unrelated parties 
our share of the credits generated may be used to reduce our federal income tax liability down to the alternative minimum tax amt rate 
under current law  credits under section are available for qualified fuels sold before january  the tax credits begin to phase out if the reference price of a barrel of oil exceeds certain levels adjusted annually for inflation 
the phase out started at per barrel and based upon information published by the internal revenue service  we do not believe there will be a phase out of section credits generated in fiscal see notes  and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

we remain a limited partner in the somerset partnership 
net income for fiscal reflects pre tax income  net of litigation expenses  of approximately  from the settlement of a previously filed lawsuit relating to our participation in this partnership 
as part of the settlement  which was effected without the admission of liability by any party  we entered into an amended and restated agreement of limited partnership which facilitates increased participation in future production of synthetic fuel 
this partnership is operational and producing synthetic fuel 
the irs has completed an audit of the somerset partnership in for calendar year as part of its normal audit program of the general partner 
the audit resulted in no impact on related tax credits generated 
tax credits generated from the somerset partnership were applied to reduce tax expense in the amounts of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
on september   we purchased a plant located in gillette  wyoming designed and constructed for the production of synthetic fuel  which qualifies for tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
we obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service  which allowed for the disassembly  and reconstruction  of the facility 
on march   we sold our membership interest in the limited liability company that owned the gillette facility to an outside party 
we received  at the time of sale  resulting in pre tax income of approximately  along with a secured contingent payment note that could provide additional investment income to us if the facility resumes commercial operation 
if the facility resumes commercial operation  we are eligible to receive million and an additional per ton of qualified production fuel produced by the facility and sold

we consider a store to be comparable after it has been open six full fiscal quarters 
comparable store sales comparisons do not include sales of extended service contracts 
we closed stores ten of which were classified as discontinued operations during fiscal and stores during fiscal we did not open any new stores in fiscals and we had stores open at january  compared to stores at january  the television category was our strongest product category for fiscal it positively impacted comparable store sales by primarily due to increased sales of lcd  dlp  plasma and other high definition ready televisions 
the other category also positively impacted comparable store sales by  primarily due to higher sales of ready to assemble furniture stands 
the audio and video categories negatively impacted comparable store sales by and  respectively 
both the audio and video categories have been impacted by lower price points of their respective products and these products becoming more of a commodity item with very high levels of competition 
the appliance category contributed to the decline in comparable store sales primarily due to lower air conditioner sales

the fourth fiscal quarter accounted for of net sales for fiscals and the fourth fiscal quarter accounted for and of operating income in fiscal and  respectively 
year to year comparisons of quarterly results of operations and comparable store sales can be affected by a variety of factors  including the duration of the holiday selling season  weather conditions and the timing of new store openings 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation has not been material to our results of operations for the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies we believe the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  require significant assumptions  judgments and estimates on the part of management 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
further  if different assumptions  judgments and estimates had been used  the results could have been different and such differences could be material 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize sales of products upon receipt by the customer 
we will honor returns from customers within seven days from the date of sale 
we establish liabilities for estimated returns at the point of sale 
we also sell product service contracts covering periods beyond the normal manufacturers warranty periods  usually with terms of coverage including manufacturers warranty periods of between to months 
contract revenues  net of sales commissions  are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the contracts after the expiration of applicable manufacturers warranty periods 
we retain the obligation to perform warranty service and such costs are charged to operations as incurred 
we recognize amounts billed to a customer for shipping and handling as revenue and actual costs incurred for shipping as selling  general and administrative expense in the income statement 
vendor allowances vendors often fund  up front  certain advertising costs and exposure to general changes in pricing to customers due to technological change 
allowances are deferred as received from vendors and recognized into income as an offset to the cost of merchandise sold when the related product is sold 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred  with no offset of vendor allowances 
inventory reserves inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market  net of reserves established for estimated technological obsolescence 
the market value of inventory is often dependent upon changes in technology resulting in significant changes in customer demand 
if these estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to market conditions that require an additional reduction in the value of certain inventories affected 
income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes  net of valuation allowances 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and other expectations about future outcomes  including the outcome of tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
changes in existing regulatory tax laws and rates may affect our ability to successfully manage regulatory matters  and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 
recoverability of long lived assets given the nature of our business  each income producing property must be evaluated separately when events and circumstances indicate that the value of that asset may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its value upon disposal are less than its carrying amount 
changes in the real estate market for particular locations could result in changes to our estimates of the property s value upon disposal 
costs associated with exit activities we occasionally vacate stores prior to the expiration of the related lease 
for vacated locations that are under long term leases  we record an expense for the difference between our future lease payments and related costs real estate taxes  maintenance  etc 
from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term  net of expected future sublease rental income 
if actual results related to sublease income  vacancy periods and the payment of settlements and repairs differ from our estimates  we may be exposed to gains and or losses that could be material 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payment 
among other items  the standard requires the company to recognize compensation cost for all share based payments  including stock options  in our consolidated statements of income 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contains pro forma disclosures regarding the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
the new standard is effective for the first period that begins after june   and allows two different methods of transition 
we expect to implement the new standard during the third quarter of fiscal  which begins august  we have not determined the impact of the adoption of fasb statement no 
r on the company s results of operations 
in december  fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the standard clarifies the accounting for inventory when there are abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials 
under existing gaap  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and re handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges rather than recorded as adjustments to the value of the inventory 
fasb statement no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
the provisions of this standard shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company was in compliance with this standard for the periods ended january   and  therefore  there will be no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations by adopting this standard 
there were other new accounting standards issued during fiscal that did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we had financial instruments which were sensitive to changes in interest rates 
these financial instruments consist of a revolving credit agreement and various mortgage notes payable secured by certain land  buildings and leasehold improvements 
the revolving credit agreement is with five banks through september   with interest at prime minus 
or libor plus and commitment fees of payable on the unused portion 
amounts available for borrowing are based upon the sum of specific percentages of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventories  as defined 
amounts available for borrowing are reduced by any letter of credit commitments outstanding 
borrowings are secured by certain fixed assets  accounts receivable  inventories and the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
at january   a total of approximately million was available for borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  net of letters of credit outstanding of million 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement at january  approximately million of the mortgage debt consists of fixed rate debt 
the interest rates range from to 
the remaining million of mortgage debt is variable rate mortgage debt 
in general  the rate on the variable rate debt ranges from prime to prime plus 
if the prime interest rate increased  we estimate our annual interest cost would increase approximately million for the variable rate mortgage debt 
principal and interest are payable monthly over terms which generally range from to years 
substantially all of the notes payable require balloon payments at the end of the scheduled term 
the fair value of our long term fixed rate mortgage debt at january  was approximately million 
the fair value was estimated based on rates available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities
