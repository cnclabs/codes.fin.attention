item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and use of estimates general in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record most of our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in the case of some of our assets  principally accounts receivable  inventories and deferred income taxes  we make adjustments to their cost or fair values to arrive at what we expect to be able to collect on outstanding accounts receivables  the amounts for which we expect to be able to sell our inventories and the amount of available tax loss and credit carryforwards and deductions that we will be able to use to reduce our future income tax liability 
those adjustments are made on the basis of a number of different factors  including judgments or assumptions we make regarding economic and market conditions and trends and their impact on our financial performance  and those judgments and assumptions are  in turn  based on current information available to us 
however  economic and market conditions are usually outside of our control and if those conditions or trends change in ways that we did not expect  gaap will require us to further adjust the amounts at which we record these assets for financial reporting purposes 
any resulting downward adjustments are commonly referred to as write downs of assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances against which we will be able to charge any such downward adjustments or write downs to those assets 
examples include reserves or allowances established for uncollectible accounts receivable sometimes referred to as bad debt reserves and reserves for inventory obsolescence 
the amounts at which those reserves are established and maintained are based on our historical experience and also on our assumptions and judgments about economic or market conditions or other factors that could affect the values at which we had recorded such assets 
those reserves are periodically increased to replenish the reserves following write downs of uncollectible accounts or to take account of increased risks due to changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
increases in reserves are effectuated by charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves or allowances are increased 
as a result  our judgments or assumptions about market or economic conditions or trends and about their effects on our financial performance can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record these assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of i adjustments or write downs of this nature and ii the increases we make to our reserves  also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events  such as increasing gasoline prices or interest rates or economic slowdowns  will have short or longer term consequences for our business  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the onset of such changes  for their full effects on our business to be recognized 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
under gaap  most businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which sales are recorded and also the amounts at which they are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on such factors as the steps or actions that a business must take to complete a sale of products to or to perform services for a customer and the circumstances under which a customer would be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services rendered to it 
additionally  in the case of a business that grants its customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  gaap requires that a reserve or allowance be established for product returns by means of a reduction in the amount at which sales are recorded  based primarily on the nature  extensiveness and duration of those return rights and historical return experience 
in making our estimates and assumptions we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business that we believe will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the carrying values of those assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for downward adjustments in those values that we may have to make in future periods 
see consolidated financial statements report of independent registered public accounting firm in item of this report 

table of contents our critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations that are discussed below 
revenue recognition and the allowance for product returns 
we recognize revenue from the sale of a product upon its shipment to the customer 
we provide our customers with limited rights to return products that we sell to them 
we establish an allowance for potential returns that reduces the amounts of our reported sales 
we estimate the allowance based on historical experience with returns of like products and current economic and market conditions and trends  which can affect the level at which customers submit product returns 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our business we extend day payment terms to our customers and  due to the seasonality of our business  during late fall and winter we grant payment terms of longer duration to those of our customers that have good credit records 
we regularly review our customers accounts and estimate the amount of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible accounts receivable in each reporting period 
the amount of the allowance is based on several factors  including the age of unpaid accounts  a review of significant past due accounts and current economic and market trends that can affect the ability of customers to keep their accounts current 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed periodically to determine if the allowance should be increased  and any increases are recorded in the accounting period in which the events or circumstances that require such increases become known 
for example  if the financial condition of some of our customers  or economic or market conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments to us on a timely basis  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is increased or replenished by recording a charge which is included in  and has the effect of increasing  selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will reduce income in the period when the increase is recorded 
reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or net realizable value and that value is reduced by an allowance for excess and slowing moving or obsolete inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of historical experience with different product lines  estimates or assumptions concerning future economic and market conditions and estimates of future sales 
if there is an economic downturn or a decline in sales  causing inventories of some product lines to accumulate  it may become necessary to increase the allowance 
other factors that can require increases in the allowance or inventory write downs are reductions in pricing or introduction of new or competitive products by manufacturers  however  due to the relative maturity of the markets in which the company operates  usually these are not significant factors 
increases in this allowance also will cause a decline in operating results as such increases are effectuated by charges against income 
allowance for deferred income taxes 
we record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet tax loss and tax credit carryforwards and tax deductions that can be applied in future periods to offset or reduce our future income tax liability 
at december   the aggregate amount of that deferred tax asset was approximately million 
under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations  tax loss and tax credit carryforwards and tax deductions will expire if not used within specified periods of time 
accordingly  the ability to use this deferred tax asset depends on the taxable income that we are able to generate during those time periods 
under gaap we estimate  and record  as a deferred tax asset  the amount of available tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to fully utilize prior to their expiration 
that estimate  in turn  is based on an estimate of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  we consider current economic and market conditions and trends in those conditions in terms of how they are likely to affect the amounts and timing of future taxable income that we currently believe we can generate during the periods remaining prior to the expiration of those tax loss and tax credit carryforwards and tax deductions 
currently available evidence leads us to believe that is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize fully the net deferred tax asset that is recorded in our financial statements 
however  if due to future events or circumstances  such as an economic downturn that might adversely affect our operating results  we subsequently come to a different conclusion regarding our ability to fully utilize this asset  we would create a valuation allowance in order to reduce the amount at which we record the deferred tax asset 
the creation of such an allowance would be effectuated by an increase in the provision or a reduction in the credit for income taxes in our statement of operations  which would have the effect of reducing our income in the fiscal period in which such provision is recorded 

table of contents long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment and goodwill and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
prior to fiscal  in accordance with gaap  we used estimated undiscounted future cash flows to determine if such an asset was impaired and would reduce its carrying value  by recording a charge against income  in the event that we determined that an impairment had occurred to the value of the asset 
for fiscal years beginning on or after january   we are required to assess our goodwill for impairment  at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  based on standards established by sfas no 
 by comparing the fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
during fiscal  as required by sfas no 
 we completed a transitional impairment test with respect to our intangible assets  including goodwill 
based on that test  we determined that goodwill had been impaired by million 
as a result  in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded  in our consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december   a non cash goodwill impairment charge in that amount as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
see the paragraph entitled intangible assets in note a to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report for additional information regarding sfas foreign currency translation 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period 
revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate for the reporting period 
foreign currency translation gains and losses not impacting cash flows are credited to or charged against other comprehensive income loss 
foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
results of operations factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products we believe that we are one of the largest wholesale distributors of replacement parts  accessories and supplies for recreational vehicles rvs and boats in north america 
our sales are made to retail parts and supplies stores  service and repair establishments and new and used rv and boat dealers after market customers 
our sales are affected primarily by i the usage of rvs and boats by the consumers to whom after market customers sell our products  because such usage affects the consumers needs for and purchases of replacement parts  repair services and supplies  and ii sales of new rvs and boats  because consumers often accessorize their rvs and boats at the time of purchase 
the usage and the purchase  by consumers  of rvs and boats depend  in large measure  upon the extent of discretionary income available to consumers and their confidence about economic conditions 
as a result  recessionary conditions and increases in interest rates often lead to declines in purchases and  to a lesser extent  in the usage  of rvs and boats 
weather conditions also affect the usage of rvs and boats 
additionally  shortages in the supply and increases in the prices of gasoline also can lead to declines in the usage and purchases of rvs and boats 
additionally  we have found  at least since september   that usage and purchases of rvs also can be affected by geopolitical conditions 
the events of september  appear to have resulted in decreases  during the three year period ended december   in international travel and in plane travel and a concomitant increase in the usage of rvs 
as a result  our sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  affected by recessionary economic conditions  increases in interest rates  shortages in the supply and increases in the prices of gasoline  and unusually adverse weather conditions and geopolitical events  as well

net sales year ended december  dollars in thousands increase vs increase vs the increase in net sales in  as compared to  was due to a number of factors  including i increased demand for rv products  particularly in the first half of the year  which we believe was largely due to an improving economic environment and low market rates of interest  ii increased acceptance and greater demand among after market customers for our coast branded proprietary products  and iii an improvement in our service levels to our customers which we believe resulted in an increase in our share of rv after market sales 
the increase in sales in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to i relatively stable consumer confidence despite a weakened economy  which we believe was at least partially attributable to low market rates of interest  ii security concerns about foreign travel and travel by air which  we believe  led to an increase in the usage and purchases of rvs  and iii our progress in implementing our inventory management and deployment program  which enabled us to improve our service levels to our customers and  we believe  increase our share of rv after market sales 

table of contents gross margin gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of products sold from net sales 
cost of products sold consist primarily of the amounts paid to manufacturers and suppliers for the products that we purchase for resale  and warehouse and distribution costs  including freight charges 
gross margin is gross profit stated as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit gross profit margin the increase in our gross margin in  as compared to  was due primarily to i a change in the mix of products sold to a greater proportion of higher margin products  including our coast branded proprietary products  ii price increases implemented on selected product lines in  iii continued strengthening in the canadian dollar  in relation to the us dollar  which reduced our canadian subsidiary s cost of purchasing products for resale from us based suppliers  and iv the fact that the fixed components of our warehouses costs were being spread over increased sales 
the increase in gross margin in was primarily due to i a reduction in both freight in and freight out expenses  which was largely a result of the implementation of our inventory management and deployment program  ii a strengthening in the canadian dollar  in relation to the us dollar  as compared to  which reduced our canadian subsidiary s cost of sales  and iii a change in the mix of products sold to a higher proportion of higher margin products in as compared to we plan to relocate our visalia  california warehouse and distribution center to a larger facility in visalia in to accommodate an increase in the volume of products maintained at and distributed from that facility 
we expect that costs associated with the relocation and expansion of that facility will offset increases in gross margin that we had expected to otherwise achieve in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of selling and marketing costs  labor and administrative costs  professional fees and expenses and the provision made for uncollectible accounts 
year ended december  dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in  sg a expenses increased in absolute dollars  by million or  and as a percentage of net sales to as compared to  in this increase was due primarily to increases in selling expenses and marketing costs  including the costs of our annual dealer buying show held in the first quarter of the year  higher insurance costs and an increase in professional fees 
the million increase in sg a expenses in  as compared to  was due primarily to increases in labor costs  both selling and administrative  as well as an increase in marketing costs 
however  as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses remained the same in as in we expect sg a expenses to increase in due primarily to i increased labor costs  ii the costs of documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting as required by section of sarbanes oxley act of  and iii increases in insurance costs 
the majority of our corporate overhead costs are incurred in the united states 
a portion of those costs are allocated to our foreign operations to the extent that they directly benefit from the expenses incurred 

table of contents operating income year ended december  dollars in thousands operating income as a percentage of net sales the increases in operating income in and  as compared to the prior year periods  were due to the combined effects of the increases in sales and gross margin  which more than offset the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
other income expense year ended december  dollars in thousands interest expense other income expense total as a percentage of net sales interest expense 
interest expense is the largest component of other income expense 
the decreases in interest expense in as compared to and in as compared to  were the result of reductions in the interest rates we paid on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement during those years 
other income 
other income in was attributable to the sale  to a manufacturer of rv parts  of manufacturing rights and equipment for and inventories of a line of proprietary products that we had been selling not only to our after market customers  but also to recreational vehicle manufacturers 
income tax provision year ended december  dollars in thousands income tax provision as a percentage of net sales effective tax rate our effective income tax rate is affected by the amount of our expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes and by varying tax rates on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
the increase in the income tax provisions in and were primarily attributable to the increases in our taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our working capital requirements for our operations primarily with borrowings under a long term revolving credit facility from a bank and internally generated funds 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we may borrow up to the lesser of i  with seasonal reductions ranging from  to  between august and february of each year  or ii an amount equal to of eligible accounts receivable and from to of eligible inventory 
interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at the bank s prime rate plus or  at the company s option but subject to certain limitations  at the bank s libor rate  plus percent 
at march   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled  our bank borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets and rank senior in priority to other indebtedness of the company 

table of contents due to the nature of our business  our primary need for working capital is to finance our accounts receivable and our purchases of inventory 
typically we bill our customers on an open account basis with day  net day terms 
during late fall and in winter  however  certain of our customers receive payment terms of longer duration and  as a result  we generally use a greater proportion of our borrowing availability during the first and fourth quarters of each year than during other parts of the year 
we were able in late and to obtain similar extended payment terms from some of our suppliers  which reduced the amounts we had to borrow under our credit facility to make inventory purchases 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain extended payment terms from our suppliers in the future 
if we are unable to do so  it would require us to incur additional borrowings under our credit facility or could adversely affect our ability to timely pay our creditors and to purchase inventory 
also  in the event our customers delay their payments to us  our payments to our creditors would have to be funded with additional bank borrowings or would have to be delayed 
we generally use cash for  rather than generate cash from  operations in the first half of the year  because we build inventories  and accounts receivable increase  as our customers begin increasing their product purchases prior to and in anticipation of the spring and summer selling seasons 
see seasonality and inflation below 
in anticipation of our annual dealer buying show and in response to our increased sales during  we increased our inventories by million at december  however  by comparison  during the fourth quarters of and  we increased our inventories by million and million  respectively 
as a result  during we generated cash from operating activities of  as compared to using net cash of  and  in operating activities in and  respectively 
we made capital expenditures of  in as compared to  in and  in these expenditures were primarily for computer enhancements and purchases of telephone and warehouse equipment 
we expect to make capital expenditures in that we estimate will range between  and  in connection with a planned relocation of our warehouse and distribution center in visalia to a larger facility 
those expenditures will be in addition to capital expenditures of a recurring nature  such as for replacement and upgrading of equipment  that we expect will range from  to  in borrowings under our credit facility decreased by  in and increased by  in and  in as noted above  the proceeds from the additional credit facility borrowings in and were used largely to increase product inventories 
we lease our facilities and certain of our equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in  rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately  the following table sets forth our currently anticipated future lease commitments for the periods indicated 
year ending december  in thousands thereafter dividend policy 
in and  we paid special cash dividends to our stockholders in the amounts aggregating  or per share  and  or  per share  respectively  primarily as a result of improvements in our operating results and cash flow in each of those years 
in january  our board of directors adopted a cash dividend policy that provides for the payment of an expected total annual cash dividend of per common share  payable in the amount of per share per quarter and declared the initial quarterly cash dividend under that policy of per share  which was paid on march  we expect  therefore  to pay cash dividends in totaling approximately  
table of contents share repurchases 
in february  the board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of up to  of our shares of common stock in open market or private purchases 
that amount is approximately equal to the increase in our stockholders equity that occurred in as a result of the exercise of stock options under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
expected uses and sources of funds 
we expect our principal uses for cash in the year ending december  will be to fund operations and the capital expenditures  cash dividends and share repurchases described above  and we anticipate that we will be able to fund those cash requirements in with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and internally generated funds 
seasonality and inflation seasonality 
sales of recreational vehicle and boating parts  supplies and accessories are seasonal 
we have significantly higher sales during the six month period from april through september than we do during the remainder of the year 
because a substantial portion of the company s expenses are fixed  operating income declines and the company sometimes incurs losses and must rely more heavily on borrowings to fund operating requirements in months when sales are lower 
the table below presents unaudited quarterly consolidated financial information for each of the fiscal years ended december  and this information has been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the information includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited consolidated quarterly operating results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in future periods 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  unaudited revenues gross profit net earnings loss net earnings loss per diluted share quarter ended march  june  september  december  unaudited revenues gross profit net earnings loss net earnings loss per diluted share inflation 
generally  we have been able to pass inflationary price increases on to our customers 
however  inflation also may cause or may be accompanied by increases in gasoline prices and interest rates 
such increases  or even the prospect of increases in the price or shortages in the supply of gasoline  can adversely affect the purchase and usage of rvs and boats  which can result in a decline in the demand for our products 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
r 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for i equity instruments of the enterprise or ii liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r supersedes apb no 
and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and that companies recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements  including stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we are required to implement the proposed standard no later than july  as permitted by statement r  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r fair value method will have an impact on our result of operations  although it will not have an impact on our overall financial or cash position 
the impact of sfas r on our operating results cannot be predicted at this time  because that will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings loss per share illustrated in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
fasb staff position accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision 
in december  the fasb issued staff position fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  which was signed into law in october that provision creates a special one time income tax deduction on foreign earnings that are repatriated into the united states 
as of december   we had not made a decision whether  or to what extent  we might be able to repatriate earnings that we generated outside the united states foreign earnings  and accordingly  our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  do not reflect any provisions for taxes on as yet unremitted foreign earnings 
we expect to make a decision  by september   whether or not to repatriate any of our foreign earnings 
certain factors that could affect our future performance statements contained in this annual report that are not historical facts or that discuss our expectations regarding our future operations or future financial performance or trends in our business constitute forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are estimates of future performance or our future financial condition or financial or market trends that are based upon current information and that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual operating results or our financial performance or condition in future periods to differ significantly from those expected at the current time 
those risks and uncertainties include  although they are not limited to  the following our business is seasonal and is subject to various economic and climatic influences 
our sales are affected directly by the purchase and usage by consumers of rvs and boats 
the purchase and  in particular  the usage of rvs and boats  are affected by consumers level of discretionary income and their confidence about economic conditions  weather conditions  prevailing interest rates  and the availability and prices of gasoline 
as a result  our future sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  adversely affected by the following circumstances or conditions loss of confidence among consumers regarding economic conditions and the onset of economic recessions  which affect the willingness of consumers to purchase and use their rvs and boats  increases in interest rates which affect the availability and affordability of financing for purchases of rvs and boats and accessories for rvs and boats  shortages in the supply and increases in the costs of gasoline which affect the costs of using  and the willingness of consumers to purchase and use  rvs and boats  and unusually severe or extended winter weather conditions  which can reduce the usage of rv and boats for periods extending beyond the ordinary winter months or to regions that ordinarily encounter milder winter weather conditions and which can cause period to period fluctuations in our sales and financial performance 
these conditions also often lead to increased price competition in our markets which could force us to reduce our prices  thereby reducing our sales revenue and our gross profit margins 
we rely heavily on bank borrowings in the operation of our business 
we rely heavily on bank borrowings to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
our outstanding borrowings create additional risks for our business 
among other things  we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund expansion or take advantage of other business opportunities  and we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest on our debt 
our existing debt also makes us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and competitive pressures and  as discussed in the section of this report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the interest we have to pay on such debt impacts our operating results 
reliance on sole sources of supply for certain of our products 
we sometimes choose to carry only a single manufacturer s products for certain of the brand name product lines that we sell 
in addition  we obtain each of our proprietary products from a single source manufacturer  although in most instances we own the tooling required for their manufacture 
dependence on a single manufacturer for any product or line of related products  however  presents some risks  including the risk that we will be unable to readily obtain alternative product supply sources in the event that a single source supplier i encounters quality or other production problems  or ii decides to enter into an exclusive supply arrangement or alliance with a competing distributor  or to vertically integrate its operations to include not only manufacturing  but also distribution  of its products 
termination of a single source supply relationship could adversely affect our sales and operating income  possibly to a significant extent 

table of contents the effects of possible changes in supply relationships in our markets 
as is the customary practice in our markets  in most instances we do not have long term supply contracts with our product suppliers 
as a result  product suppliers are free to change the terms on which they will sell us products or to discontinue supplying us with products altogether  because they may choose to distribute their products directly to after market dealers or because they might choose to establish exclusive supply relationships with other distributors 
additionally  manufacturers of new rvs and boats may choose to incorporate optional equipment on their rvs and boats at the time of manufacture that  historically were provided to their dealers by distributors such as the company 
any of these occurrences could result in increased competition in our markets or reductions in the number of products we are able to offer our customers  which could cause our sales to decline and could result in lower margins 
no assurance that we will be able to fund cash dividends pursuant to our dividend policy 
although the board of directors has adopted a cash dividend policy that provides for regular quarterly cash dividends of per share  the payment of cash dividends in the future will depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  our future financial performance and our available cash resources and the cash requirements of our business and  possibly also  the consents of third parties  such as the lender under our revolving credit facility 
as a result  there can be no assurance that future quarterly cash dividends will be equal to the pre share called for by the dividend policy or that we will not find it necessary to suspend or even terminate the payment of cash dividends in the future 
anticipated increase in expenses in and costs of compliance with sarbanes oxley act of we expect to incur increased expenses in in connection with the planned relocation of our current visalia  california warehouse and distribution center to a larger facility in visalia and the expansion of the operations we conduct at that facility 
additionally  we will be incurring an increase in expenses to document and to review and test the operation of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of as a result  we expect our costs of sales and our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in we cannot predict the amount of that increase with any certainty at this time 
however  that increase could result in a reduction in our income in as compared to additionally  the documentation  review and testing of our internal control over financial reporting will entail a significant investment of management time and resources and  even after that process had been completed  we expect we will have to incur continuing costs  including increased accounting fees  in order to maintain compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
additional uncertainties are discussed above in this section of this report including  in particular  in the introductory portion of this section that discusses our accounting policies and estimates and the effects those policies and estimates can have on our future financial position and operating results 
due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements contained in this report  which speak only as of the date of this annual report 
we also disclaim any obligation to update forward looking information contained in this report  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk with respect to financial instruments is primarily related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowing activities  which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
to a lesser degree  we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency fluctuations associated with our canadian operations and our canadian currency denominated debt 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any derivative financial instruments 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
the fair value of borrowings under our revolving credit facility approximates the carrying value of such obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding million under our revolving credit facility 
we sometimes enter into forward exchange agreements to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of our inventory purchases in canada for our canadian operations 
the gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in earnings in the period during which the transactions being hedged are recognized 
we believe that these agreements do not subject us to significant market risk from exchange rate movements because the agreements offset gains and losses on the balances and transactions being hedged 
as of december   there were no such agreements outstanding 
approximately of our debt is denominated in canadian currency  which also exposes us to market risk associated with exchange rate movements 
historically  we have not used derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations since the market risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt has not been considered significant
