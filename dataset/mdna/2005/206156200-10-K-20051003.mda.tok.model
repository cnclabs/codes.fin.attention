item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we anticipate that in fiscal  we will make more extensive use of the jenoptik brand  which we licensed in connection with our acquisition of jenimage europe gmbh jenimage  a german corporation located in jena  germany  to increase sales of our branded digital cameras 
in late fiscal  we initiated a project to identify  assess and  as appropriate  commercialize new business opportunities and products 
there can be no assurances  however  that any new business initiatives we may undertake will successfully reverse our losses  increase our revenues  decrease costs or have a positive effect on our financial position

the photography market there are three main types of cameras within the amateur photography market o single use cameras single use cameras are sold preloaded with film and batteries and are designed to be used only once by the consumer 
after use  the consumer returns the entire camera to the photo processor 
the processor then extracts the film and either disposes of the used camera or returns and or sells it for recycling 
o digital cameras digital cameras use an electronic sensor and other components to capture and process an image electronically versus silver halide film  that is then stored within memory 
most digital cameras possess an image review capability that enables instantaneous viewing and or deletion 
in addition  images can be downloaded to a computer for viewing  manipulation  storage  transmission via the internet or printing 
o mm traditional film cameras this category includes all other non single use cameras that use silver halide film 
market trends market trends within the image capture industry include the following o single use cameras single use cameras are inexpensive  easy to use and deliver high quality photographs 
according to available third party market research data  after years of robust growth  the single use camera market is estimated to have reached a peak of million units sold worldwide in calendar year going forward  growth in unit sales is expected to be essentially flat in calendar year  after which it is projected to decline over time  yet remain a large and viable category 
o digital cameras digital photography is one of the fastest growing areas of the photography market 
according to available third party market research data  worldwide consumer digital camera unit sales are projected to grow in calendar year but decrease an average of per year from calendar year to although lower mega pixel mp cameras are declining in unit terms  and mp  most of the growth is driven by products with mp or greater  and mp 
from calendar year to  western europe unit sales of  and mp cameras are expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately  and  respectively 
in comparison  united states unit sales of  and mp cameras are expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately  and  respectively  during the same period 
o mm traditional film cameras although we expect mm traditional film cameras to continue to be sold in certain markets and channels in the foreseeable future  we believe that this market will decline significantly over the next several years as consumers increasingly use digital cameras and related digital capture products as substitutes for mm traditional film cameras 
in light of these market trends  we are focusing on increasing our sales of single use cameras through various sales and marketing initiatives and the development of new single use camera designs and products with lower costs  improved performance  enhanced quality  greater consumer appeal and new features 
we plan on using the jenoptik brand more extensively to increase sales of our branded digital cameras 
we are also exploring various new business opportunities and products 
products our products include single use  digital and mm traditional film cameras 
we sell to our retail customers our own branded and private label products  a number of which we have developed  designed and manufactured 
we have also served as an outsourced manufacturer of developed and co developed products for our customers 
we offer a complete line of single use cameras  including outdoor  flash  auto wind and underwater models 
we believe that we are uniquely structured to provide encasements  finishes and packaging to accommodate different user and customer preferences 
we offer a variety of digital cameras  including complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos and charge coupled device ccd imager based digital cameras  ranging from video graphics array vga resolution up to and including mp 
our mm traditional film cameras range from entry level to higher priced  fully featured zoom models and include models used by certain rsd customers to support special promotion and loyalty programs offered to their customers 
our expenditures for product design and development decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal we expect design and product development expense to continue to decrease in fiscal as we no longer rely on internally designed and manufactured digital cameras 
for additional information regarding product development costs  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing we sell to retailers on a worldwide basis through offices and or representatives in the americas and offices in the united kingdom  france and germany europe and hong kong  china and japan asia 
we currently market our products to retailers on a private label basis and or under the following brand names o concord o keystone o easyshot o le clic o fun shooter o polaroid o jenoptik we have established our presence with our retail customers by offering attractive  easy to use and popularly priced single use  digital and mm traditional film cameras 
we produce and or market many different styles of cameras that are sold through thousands of retail outlets 
we have in house sales and marketing personnel who make the majority of our direct sales to our customers 
we also have independent sales representatives who serve specific geographic areas 
sales representatives generally receive commissions ranging from to of net sales to retail customers  depending on the type of customer and product  and may act as sales representatives for manufacturers of other photographic and non photographic products 
we also sell products to distributors on a wholesale basis who  in turn  sell our products to retailers 
competition the image capture industry  and particularly digital products  is highly competitive with over companies marketing products to the retail market 
as a producer and or marketer of popularly priced image capture products  we encounter substantial competition from a number of companies  many of which have longer operating histories  more established markets and brand recognition  and more extensive research  development and manufacturing capabilities than we have 
key competitors include canon  fuji  hewlett packard  kodak  olympus  nikon  sony  pentax  konica minolta  panasonic  samsung and vivitar 
many of these competitors have greater resources than we have or may reasonably be expected to have in the foreseeable future 
maintaining a competitive advantage depends on our ability to develop and manufacture or purchase from outsourced manufacturers high quality products at the lowest cost 
backlog due to the lead time required for production and shipping and the need to build inventory to meet seasonal demand  we may at times have a backlog of orders for products 
we define backlog as unfulfilled orders supported by signed contracts or purchase orders for delivery of our products generally within the next six months 
our backlog at july  was approximately million 
we experience fluctuations in our backlog at various times during our fiscal year 
we expect that approximately million of the unfulfilled orders at july  will be shipped during the first quarter of fiscal although we believe that our entire backlog consists of firm orders  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual revenue for any future period because of the possibility of customer cancellations  order changes  changes in delivery schedules and delays inherent in the shipments of products 
no assurance can be given that the current backlog will necessarily lead to revenue in any specific future period 
major customers in fiscal  we had two retail customers each of whose purchases represented in excess of of our total net sales i wal mart represented of total net sales  and ii walgreens represented of total net sales 
kodak  our largest dms customer  ceased purchases under our two dms contracts during fiscal in fiscal  sales to kodak accounted for million  or  of our total net sales as compared to million or   of our total net sales in fiscal although we continue to seek and evaluate dms business opportunities  we expect dms sales to be nominal in fiscal see note geographic area and significant customer information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality sales of our products are linked to the timing of vacations  holidays and other leisure activities 
sales are normally strongest in the first and second quarters summer  fall and early winter of our fiscal year when demand is high as retailers prepare for the holiday season 
sales are also strong in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year spring to early summer due to demand driven by heavy vacation activity and events such as weddings and graduations 
sales are normally lowest in the third quarter of our fiscal year winter to early spring with the absence of holidays and fewer people taking vacations 
licensing activities we have a worldwide non exclusive license which excluded japan until january  to use certain of the single use camera patents and patent applications of fuji photo film ltd 
fuji in connection with the manufacture  remanufacture and sale of single use cameras 
the license extends until the later of february  or the expiration of the last of the licensed fuji patents and provides for payment of a license fee and certain royalty payments to fuji 
our ability to manufacture and sell single use cameras depends on the continuation of our right to use the fuji patents 
as a result  the loss of the fuji license prior to the expiration of the patents could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operation 
we have two license agreements with polaroid corporation polaroid  each of which will expire in february and are renewable at our option for an additional three year term 
these licenses provide for the exclusive with the exception of products already previously released by polaroid into the distribution chain  worldwide use of the polaroid brand trademark in connection with the manufacture  distribution  promotion and sale of single use and mm traditional film cameras and certain related accessories 
the licenses do not include instant or digital cameras 
each license agreement provides for our payment of million of minimum royalties  or million in total  which were paid in full as of august and are fully credited against percentage royalties 
we are currently in discussions with polaroid regarding the renewal of the license agreements 
we believe that the loss of the polaroid license would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
as part of our acquisition of jenimage  we entered into a twenty year  worldwide trademark license agreement with jenoptik ag for the exclusive use of the jenoptik brand name and trademark on non professional consumer imaging products including  but not limited to  digital  single use and traditional cameras  and other imaging products and related accessories

manufacturers and suppliers located in the far east and other parts of the world supply us with raw materials  components and finished products that we do not manufacture 
in fiscal  we purchased raw materials and components such as film  batteries  glass lenses  plastic resins  metal  packaging  electronic components  sensors  digital signal processors  memory and displays 
in fiscal  we do not expect to purchase components relating to the manufacture of digital cameras since we have outsourced the manufacture of these products 
digital camera procurement and component procurement for digital cameras is more complex than for traditional and single use cameras 
availability  longer procurement lead times  delays in procurement  and price fluctuations of digital cameras and the components for digital cameras  which are outside our control  adversely impacted our business  inventory position  results of operations and financial condition in fiscal in fiscal  we do not expect to purchase components relating to the manufacture of digital cameras since we have outsourced the manufacture of these products

see risk factors below 
these factors may cause results to differ materially from the statements made in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of the company 
overview we design  develop  manufacture  outsource and sell popularly priced  easy to use image capture products worldwide 
our products include single use  digital and mm traditional film cameras 
we manufacture and assemble our products in the peoples republic of china prc for sale to retail sales and distribution rsd and design and manufacturing services dms customers 
we sell our private label and brand name products to our rsd customers worldwide either directly or through third party distributors 
during fiscal  we experienced a substantial reduction in dms single use camera sales primarily as a result of the decision of eastman kodak company kodak to cease purchases under its two dms contracts with us 
although we continue to seek and evaluate dms business opportunities  we expect dms sales to be nominal in fiscal in fiscal  we increased purchases of digital cameras from outsourced manufacturers  and we expect that our reliance on the outsourced manufacture of the digital camera products we provide to our rsd customers will continue to increase in fiscal we ceased manufacturing digital cameras at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired jenimage europe gmbh  a german corporation jenimage 
accordingly  the fiscal and fiscal results include twelve months and approximately two months  respectively  of the operating results of jenimage 
pro forma results for fiscal are not presented as the fiscal results of jenimage were not significant 
additionally  since jenimage was operationally integrated and legally merged into our existing german subsidiary and operations  we are unable to separately present jenimage s effect on results of operations for fiscal the primary causes of our loss in fiscal were lower single use camera sales and production volumes  lower digital camera prices  digital camera and component inventory charges and restructuring and other charges 
in fiscal and continuing in fiscal  we initiated a strategic review process to determine how we may better compete in the digital camera market 
as part of this process  we evaluated and continue to evaluate a number of strategies related to digital cameras 
the strategic review process led to the restructuring plan and other cost reduction initiatives announced and initially implemented in the second quarter of fiscal these initiatives were designed to eliminate our reliance on internally designed and manufactured digital cameras and increase the design  co development and purchase of digital cameras from outsourced manufacturers 
we expect these initiatives to significantly reduce costs and expenses in connection with our sales of digital cameras and to achieve a more competitive business model 
we ceased manufacturing digital cameras at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal and expect to realize the benefits of these initiatives in fiscal we incurred costs in integrating jenimage with our european operations and consolidating certain european operations and departments at our offices in jena  germany 
subsequent to the acquisition  jenimage was merged with the company s subsidiary concord camera gmbh which is now a distributor and marketer of jenoptik branded photographic and imaging products 
the jenoptik brand  which we have licensed from jenoptik ag for a twenty year period  is recognized in germany and other german speaking countries 
other costs incurred in fiscal included  among other things  restructuring charges incurred in connection with our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives  the cost of implementing a new  worldwide enterprise resource planning system erp system  compliance costs associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act of the sox project  costs incurred in connection with potential acquisitions  strategic planning consulting costs and additional audit and review fees  including the sox project 
our worldwide  fully integrated erp system was launched during the first quarter of fiscal in part to improve the overall effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures 
during fiscal  we identified eight material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
two of the material weaknesses related to the planning and implementation of the erp system and to our financial statement closing process 
these material weaknesses resulted in significant delays in accumulating data  performing analyses and evaluating results necessary to support the timely preparation of our quarterly reports on form q during fiscal as a result  each of our quarterly reports for fiscal was not timely filed with the securities and exchange commission sec 
the migration of our jenimage operations onto the erp system in the third quarter of fiscal further exacerbated problems with the erp system and the financial statement closing process  and the material weaknesses in these and other areas continued to exist as of the end of fiscal for further discussion regarding our disclosure controls and procedures  internal control over financial reporting and material weaknesses  see item a  controls and procedures 
due to continuing losses in the first two quarters of fiscal  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we implemented additional cost reduction initiatives and adopted sales guidelines which were designed to mitigate inventory risks and improve profitability 
these initiatives included  among other things  eliminating certain employee positions and consolidating certain of our european operations and departments at our offices in jena  germany 
as a result  we reduced our operations in the united kingdom and france and expanded our operations in jena  germany 
we expect the sales guidelines to improve overall gross profit margins on the sale of digital cameras  but to decrease sales volume of digital cameras in the united states  canada and latin america the americas 
we expect to realize the benefits of the sales guidelines and additional cost reduction initiatives in fiscal we are continuing to review our strategies  including the implementation of additional cost reduction initiatives and possible new business initiatives 
there can be no assurances that implementing any such initiatives will successfully reverse our losses  increase our revenues  decrease costs or have a positive effect on our financial position 
significant factors affecting the change in year over year results of operations are as follows lower single use sales and production volumes  lower digital camera prices  digital camera and component inventory charges  and restructuring and other charges 
lower single use camera sales and production volumes during fiscal  we experienced a substantial reduction in dms single use camera sales primarily as a result of the decision of kodak to cease purchases under its two dms contracts with us 
this reduction in dms single use camera sales had a material adverse effect on our results of operations in fiscal  and we expect it will continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods unless we are able to substantially increase sales to other customers or sales of other products 
although we continue to seek and evaluate dms business opportunities  we expect dms sales to be nominal in fiscal in addition  sales of single use cameras to two of our significant rsd customers declined 
see note geographic area and significant customer information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant customers 
these declines in single use camera sales volumes led to lower production volumes in our manufacturing facilities 
the lower production volumes created under absorption of manufacturing labor and overhead and other costs and inefficiencies 
these factors contributed to a significant decrease in gross profit 
lower digital camera prices during fiscal  we experienced a significant decline in average digital camera selling prices resulting from competitive pricing and weak end customer sales of our products with certain retail customers 
however  this decline was partially offset by a year over year increase in digital camera sales volume resulting from including a complete year of net sales related to jenimage 
price declines in digital cameras also led to significant inventory charges because we lowered the carrying values of certain digital camera inventories below their cost bases 
digital camera and component inventory charges we continue to experience significant competition and substantial price declines in digital cameras 
we decreased the carrying values of certain digital camera components  finished goods and return camera inventory below their cost basis to their estimated market values during fiscal in fiscal  we recorded inventory charges of approximately million mainly related to digital camera and component inventory 
sales of certain digital cameras whose carrying values were lowered to estimated market values also resulted in significantly lower gross profit 
further  we anticipate that sales of certain digital cameras whose carrying values were lowered in fiscal will have an adverse effect on our fiscal results of operations resulting from significantly lower and or no gross profit on these sales 
restructuring and other charges as a result of our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives  we incurred approximately million in restructuring and other charges during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded additional depreciation expense of million related to the reduction in the remaining useful lives of certain equipment  tooling and other fixed assets used in the manufacture of certain digital cameras 
see note restructuring and other charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the benefits resulting from these initiatives are expected to be realized in fiscal we expect to make payments relating to the restructuring and other charges of approximately million during fiscal and plan to fund these disbursements from our cash and cash equivalents 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our application of accounting policies affects these estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes revenue recognition we recognize revenue  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition corrected copy  when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and collectibility is probable 
title and risk of loss generally transfer when the product is delivered to the customer or upon shipment  depending upon negotiated contractual arrangements 
sales are recorded net of anticipated returns which we estimate based on historical rates of return  adjusted for current events as appropriate  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas no 

if actual future returns are higher than estimated  then net sales could be adversely affected 
management has assessed the appropriateness of the timing of revenue recognition in accordance with sfas no 
after considering the requirements of sfas no 
 we concluded we would defer recognition of revenue from certain customers until such customers transactions meet all of the requirements of sfas no 
we may enter into arrangements to offer certain pricing discounts and allowances that do not provide an identifiable separate benefit or service or may enter into arrangements to provide certain free products 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  we record the pricing discounts and allowances as a reduction of sales and record the cost of free products ratably into cost of products sold based upon the underlying revenue transaction 
sales returns we establish a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical product return trends 
if the actual future returns are higher than we originally estimated  which we based upon historical data  our net sales could be adversely affected 
provision for doubtful accounts we base the provision for doubtful accounts on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts owed to us could be adversely affected 
inventories inventory purchases and commitments are based upon estimates of future demand that are difficult to forecast 
if i there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  ii there is a higher rate of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  and or iii the market value and selling prices of our products to our customers decline or the price at which these customers can purchase similar products from other manufacturers is lower than ours  we may be required to reduce our inventory values which would result in lower of cost or market value adjustments 
such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on our gross profit 
the obsolescence risk related to digital cameras is more significant than mm traditional film and single use cameras due to  among other factors  the shorter life cycles of digital products 
see risk factors below 
deferred income taxes the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance is based on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred income tax assets on an ongoing basis and may be adjusted from time to time as necessary 
in determining the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives and strategies 
we have a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred income tax assets as of july  and july  should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance and increase income 
alternatively  if we determine that we would not be able to realize a recorded deferred income tax asset  an adjustment to increase our valuation allowance would be charged to the results of operations in the period in which we reach such a conclusion 
impairment of long lived and other assets periodically  we review our long lived assets for impairment 
we record an impairment loss when indications of impairment are present and undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying values 
since we incurred significant operating losses in fiscal and fiscal  a potential impairment indicator  we performed an impairment test of our long lived and other assets as of july  by summarizing the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual sale of our long lived and other assets  excluding goodwill 
the sum of the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying values of these assets and  accordingly  we concluded these carrying values are recoverable 
assets reviewed included patents  prepaid amounts related to licensing and royalty agreements and property  plant and equipment 
no impairment charges were recorded for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal accounting for litigation and settlements we are involved in various legal proceedings 
due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties and the possibility of governmental intervention 
management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
while certain of these matters involve substantial amounts  management believes based on available information that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition taken as a whole 
off balance sheet arrangements under sec regulations  in certain circumstances  we are required to make certain disclosures regarding the following off balance sheet arrangements  if material any obligation under certain guarantee contracts  any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  and any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements pursuant to these regulations  other than those described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not have  nor do we believe we engage in  transactions with any special purpose entities 
we are not engaged in hedging activities and had no forward exchange contracts or other derivatives outstanding at july  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into operating lease commitments  purchase commitments and other contractual obligations

results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to net sales for fiscal the decrease in net sales was primarily due to a reduction in the sales volume of single use cameras sold to significant rsd and dms customers and lower average selling prices for digital cameras resulting from significant pricing competition and weak end customer sales of our products with certain retail customers 
this reduction in net sales was partially offset by the inclusion of a complete fiscal year of net sales related to jenimage 
rsd net sales were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to the same period last year  and accounted for of total net sales 
rsd net sales from our operations in the us  canada and latin america americas for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to fiscal the decrease in rsd net sales was due primarily to reduced sales of single use and digital cameras to two significant customers 
this decrease in sales had a material adverse effect on fiscal results of operations 
the reduction in sales to one significant rsd customer was due to the customer s overstocked inventory levels of single use cameras during the first and second quarters of fiscal during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  sales of single use cameras to this customer increased over the levels of the second quarter of fiscal  and we expect sales of single use cameras to this customer will continue to increase as its inventory levels decrease 
the reduction in sales to the other significant rsd customer was attributable to a reduction in sales of digital cameras partially offset by an increase in sales of single use cameras to such customer 
rsd net sales from our operations in europe for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to the same period last year 
this increase was principally attributable to the acquisition of jenimage 
dms net sales were million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  as compared to fiscal  and accounted for of total net sales 
the decrease in dms net sales was primarily attributable to lower sales to kodak  for whom we manufactured products under two dms agreements 
sales to kodak in fiscal accounted for of total net sales  while in fiscal  sales to kodak accounted for of total net sales 
as previously reported  kodak advised us that it would cease purchases under the two dms contracts during the second quarter of fiscal the winding down of sales to kodak had a material adverse effect on our results of operations for fiscal  and we expect that the cessation of sales to kodak will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods unless we are able to substantially increase sales to other customers or sales of other products 
net sales from our operations in asia for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to fiscal net sales from our operations in asia for fiscal include rsd sales of million and all of our dms sales 
the decrease was attributable primarily to a reduction in sales to kodak partially offset by sales from our subsidiary in japan 
gross deficit profit gross deficit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  versus gross profit of million  or of net sales  in fiscal during fiscal  gross deficit  in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  was negatively affected by the following factors i reduced sales volume of single use cameras and lower average selling prices for digital cameras  ii a million charge to reduce the carrying value of certain finished goods  components  work in process  raw material and return camera inventory below its cost basis to its estimated market value resulting from price declines  iii restructuring and other charges of million consisting of a reduction in the carrying value of certain finished goods  components  work in process  raw material and return camera inventory below its cost basis to its estimated market value and employee severance costs attributable to our restructuring initiatives and cost initiatives  iv lower production volumes in our manufacturing facilities which created under absorption of manufacturing labor and overhead and other costs of million  and v additional depreciation expense of million related to the reduction in the remaining useful lives of certain molds and tooling used in the production of certain digital cameras 
product engineering  design and development costs for fiscal and fiscal  in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  were million and million  respectively 
we expect engineering  design and product development costs  excluding restructuring and other charges  to continue to decrease as we increase our purchases of digital cameras from outsourced manufacturers as a result of our restructuring initiatives 
for further discussion  see inventories under the caption  critical accounting policies above  and note restructuring and other charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses selling expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the cost of additional sales and marketing personnel and increases in freight related shipping costs 
selling expenses in fiscal also included costs incurred by jenimage 
general and administrative g a expenses  excluding variable stock based compensation or income  for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decrease in g a expenses was primarily due to decreases in personnel costs and decreases in professional fees associated with designing and installing our erp system  partially offset by increased costs and the recording of expenses related to previously capitalized costs incurred in connection with potential acquisitions 
g a expenses in fiscal also included costs incurred by jenimage 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we expect to incur approximately million of costs related to compliance with the sox project 
we did not recognize any variable stock based compensation expense for fiscal because the price of our common stock was lower than the exercise price of of our repriced options at the beginning and end of the fiscal year 
variable stock based compensation income for fiscal was million because the company s stock price on july  was lower than the price of our common stock used to compute variable stock based compensation expense in previous quarters 
we consider all of our variable stock based compensation or income as a component of g a expenses 
see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  stock based compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in average outstanding indebtedness under financing facilities during fiscal as compared to fiscal see hong kong financing facilities included in liquidity and capital resources 
other income  net other income  net was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of an available for sale investment and the gain on the sale of a building in the united kingdom

income taxes income attributable to hong kong business activities is taxed separately from the prc 
the company s hong kong subsidiary s annual effective income tax rate is 
the company has never paid any income or turnover tax to the prc related to its processing activities in the prc  but there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to pay such taxes in the future 
existing prc statutes can be construed as providing for a minimum of to income tax and a turnover tax on the company s business activities  however  the prc has never attempted to enforce those statutes 
the company has been advised that the prc s state tax bureau is reviewing the applicability of those statutes to processing activities of the type engaged in by the company  but it has not yet announced any final decisions as to the taxability of those activities 
after consultation with its tax advisors  the company does not believe that any tax exposure it may have on account of its operations in the prc will be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company has historically not provided for us federal and state income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries on the basis that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested outside the us as a result of current year losses realized by its foreign subsidiaries  the foreign subsidiaries have an accumulated earnings deficit of approximately million as of july  consequently  there is no basis to provide for us federal and state income taxes for the results of the foreign operations 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if such earnings were ever remitted 
however  no foreign withholding taxes would be payable under current law 
as of july   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for us tax purposes of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards are scheduled to expire between and additionally  the company has approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards related to its foreign operations  of which million relates to hong kong 
a significant portion of these net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration dates 
in fiscal  management evaluated the realizability of the company s deferred income tax assets 
as part of assessing the realizability of its deferred income tax assets  management evaluated whether it is more likely than not that some portion  or all of its deferred income tax assets  will be realized 
the realization of its us  europe and hong kong deferred income tax assets relates directly to the company s tax planning initiatives and strategies for us federal and state  europe and hong kong tax purposes in fiscal  based on all the available evidence  management determined that it is not more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets will be fully realized 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against all of the company s deferred income tax assets in fiscal for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company s effective tax rate was  and  respectively 
the company s future effective tax rate will depend on the apportionment between foreign and domestic taxable income and losses  the statutory rates of the related tax jurisdictions and any changes to the valuation allowance 
net loss as a result of the matters described above  we incurred a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted common share  for fiscal as compared to a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted common share  for fiscal restructuring and other charges restructuring initiatives during the second quarter of fiscal  we announced restructuring initiatives designed to eliminate our reliance on internally designed and manufactured digital cameras and increase the design  co development and purchase of digital cameras from outsourced manufacturers to provide competitive products to the retail market 
we ceased manufacturing digital cameras at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the restructuring initiatives are a result of our previously announced strategic review process to determine how we may better compete in the digital camera market 
the restructuring initiatives were substantially implemented by the end of second quarter fiscal and resulted in the termination of approximately  employees either as a result of voluntary or involuntary terminations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and fiscal  approximately  and  employees  respectively  were terminated either as a result of voluntary or involuntary terminations 
these employees were primarily employed in manufacturing  engineering  sales  marketing and administration functions in the prc 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and fiscal  we incurred approximately million and million  respectively  in expenses related to employee severance costs incurred in connection with the restructuring initiatives 
at july   we had a restructuring reserve recorded in the amount of million representing the unpaid amount of the accrued employee severance costs 
such liability is included under accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the restructuring initiatives  we also recorded restructuring related inventory charges in the amount of million during fiscal primarily related to raw material  component and finished goods inventories related to digital cameras that we will no longer manufacture 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we reduced the remaining useful lives of certain molds and tooling used in the manufacture of these digital cameras because we decided to exit the manufacture of digital cameras 
the products were either no longer in production or had a shortened product life and these specific molds and tooling do not have alternative production uses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and fiscal  we recorded an additional million and million  respectively  in depreciation expense related to the reduction in the useful lives of such molds and tooling

the services of these employees benefit parts of the business other than the manufacture of digital cameras 
accordingly  these retention costs are classified as other charges in table ii below 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and fiscal  we incurred approximately million and million  respectively  in expenses related to employee retention costs and expect to incur additional expenses of approximately million related to retention costs through december   provided such employees are retained through that date 
cost reduction initiatives 
during the third quarter of fiscal  as a result of our continued evaluation of our cost structure and the strategic review process  we implemented additional cost reduction initiatives including  among other things  eliminating certain employee positions and consolidating certain operations in the united kingdom  france and germany into our offices in jena  germany 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge in the amount of approximately million related to employee severance costs incurred in connection with the cost reduction initiatives 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to eliminate certain employee positions in canada and reverse certain decisions made at the end of the third quarter of fiscal regarding the elimination of certain employee positions 
accordingly  we recorded a net reduction in severance expense in the amount of approximately million 
in addition  we entered into retention agreements with certain employees affected by our decision to consolidate certain european operations 
as a result  we recorded an expense of approximately million related to the retention of certain european employees

rsd net sales were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal  and accounted for of total net sales 
the growth in rsd net sales was primarily due to sales of private label mm traditional film cameras and polaroid branded single use cameras  new customers and organic growth from customers due to sell through and new product introductions 
dms net sales were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal  and accounted for of total net sales 
the increase in dms net sales was primarily attributable to sales of single use cameras to kodak  partially offset by lower sales to existing customers 
in fiscal  sales to kodak accounted for of total net sales or million as compared to million  or  of total net sales in fiscal rsd net sales in the americas for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase in rsd net sales in fiscal was due to sales of polaroid branded and other single use and mm traditional film cameras to new and existing customers resulting in increased market penetration  new digital camera product sales and organic growth from existing customers due to sell through and new product introductions 
rsd net sales in europe for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to offering new digital products to new and existing customers and the inclusion of sales to customers of jenimage for the last two months of fiscal net sales in asia for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to growth in sales to our dms customers and  to a lesser extent  sales by our new subsidiary in japan which was established in fiscal gross profit gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal during fiscal  gross profit was negatively affected by an million pre tax charge to cost of products sold to lower the carrying value of certain digital camera and component inventories below their cost basis to their estimated net realizable value and increased depreciation expense by million related to the reduction of the remaining useful lives of molds and tooling related to certain digital cameras 
the lower carrying value resulted from the negative effect of price declines in the digital camera market  competitive pricing pressure and excess customer inventory levels 
in addition  higher manufacturing costs mainly resulting from production inefficiencies related to the production of digital camera products contributed to the decrease in gross profit  in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
incremental overhead costs associated with the costs incurred in designing our erp system throughout fiscal also contributed to lower gross profit in fiscal changing our method of applying manufacturing labor and overhead costs to inventories during the first quarter of fiscal resulted in the cost of products sold and net loss in fiscal each being approximately million higher per diluted share than under the prior method of applying manufacturing labor and overhead costs to inventories 
see note inventories  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the comparable prior year period included a million benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of a previously disclosed disputed claim with a dms customer in the third quarter of fiscal partially offset by million of additional air freight costs resulting from a west coast dock workers labor dispute 
product engineering  design and development costs for fiscal and fiscal  in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  were million and million  respectively 
for further discussion on inventory valuation  see inventories under the caption  critical accounting policies above 
operating expenses selling expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales as compared to million  or of net sales in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the cost of additional sales and marketing personnel  royalties related to the polaroid brand licenses  the cost of attending tradeshows and higher variable costs including freight and handling  all of which were attributable to the year over year increase in sales 
selling expenses in fiscal included costs incurred by jenimage during the last two months of fiscal g a expenses were million  or of net sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in g a expenses was primarily the result of increases in personnel  severance costs  professional fees associated with designing and installing the erp system  costs associated with the sox project  and additional costs associated with our anticipated sales growth 
g a expenses in fiscal included costs incurred by jenimage during the last two months of fiscal during fiscal  g a expenses were reduced by a million recovery of a previously reserved accounts receivable amount due from polaroid corporation 
variable stock based compensation income for fiscal was million because our common stock price on july  was below the exercise price of our repriced stock options of 
variable stock based compensation income cannot exceed the cumulative expense recorded to date of million for the outstanding repriced options 
for fiscal  we recorded million of variable stock based compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations because our common stock price on june  was higher than the exercise price of our repriced stock options of 
see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  stock based compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the decrease of million was attributable to the reduction in interest expense related to the repurchase of senior notes in august and the related non recurring write off of deferred finance costs of million recorded in fiscal see note senior notes  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
goodwill impairment goodwill impairment was million for fiscal compared to no expense incurred in fiscal under fas  goodwill impairment exists if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
we utilized our market capitalization at july  to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
as a result of the impairment tests  we recorded a million impairment charge for all of our goodwill 
other income  net other income  net was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease of million related primarily to the loss of million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the sale of short term investments 
over the holding period of the short term investments  we realized a net positive return of million after giving effect to the dividend income received which more than offset the loss 
see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income tax provision was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in income tax in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the increase in our income tax valuation allowance as a result of management s assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets and an increase in losses generated from our foreign operations 
see income taxes under fiscal compared to fiscal for additional income tax information 
extraordinary gain acquired net assets in excess of cost we completed the acquisition of jenimage in the fourth quarter of fiscal the acquisition  recorded under the purchase method of accounting  included the purchase of of the outstanding stock of jenimage for million in cash  excluding any related acquisitions costs 
a portion of the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market value at the date of acquisition 
the million of net assets acquired exceeded the total purchase price of million and  as a result  million was recorded as an extraordinary gain 
net loss income as a result of the matters described above  we reported a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  for fiscal as compared to net income of million  or and per basic and diluted share  respectively  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources we are not engaged in hedging activities and had no forward exchange contracts outstanding at july  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into operating lease commitments  purchase commitments and other contractual obligations 
these transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and are more fully discussed below 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  anticipated cash flow from working capital and amounts available under our credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity and capital resources for our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents decreased by million from million at july  to million at july   primarily as a result of cash used in operating activities of million  a net repayment of million related to borrowings under credit facilities and million used for capital expenditures 
these uses of cash  totaling million  were partially offset by million of net proceeds provided by the sale of short term and available for sale investments 
short term investments short term investments  including available for sale investments  decreased by million from million at july  to million at july   primarily as a result of the sale of investments to provide cash flow for operations and debt repayment 
net proceeds from sales of short term and available for sale investments resulted in total cash of million including a net gain of million 
cash used in provided by operating activities cash used in operations in fiscal was million  which compared favorably to cash used in operating activities of million for fiscal but unfavorably to cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal the changes in cash provided by operating activities for the respective fiscal years were primarily attributable to net loss income  inventory charges  depreciation and other non cash items  and changes in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
cash provided by used in investing activities capital expenditures for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million  and million  respectively  and related primarily to expenditures on plant and equipment for our manufacturing facilities in the prc 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily the result of significantly reduced expenditures related to the erp system purchased in fiscal and a reduction in expenditures primarily related to digital camera production tooling and other plant and equipment at our manufacturing facilities in the prc 
in fiscal  we received proceeds of approximately million upon the sale of an  square foot building on a one half acre parcel in coalville  england that was used in connection with our operations in the united kingdom 
for fiscal  the increase in cash from investing activities related to proceeds received from the sale of short term and available for sale investments  offset by cash used in the jenimage acquisition  net of cash received 
cash used in provided by financing activities cash flow used in financing activities in fiscal was million resulting from the repayments of net borrowings under credit facilities 
cash provided from financing activities in the amount of million during fiscal resulted from proceeds of million received from borrowings under our short term financing facilities and proceeds of million received from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises 
operating leases we enter into operating leases in the ordinary course of business eg  warehouse facilities  office space and equipment 
the effects of outstanding leases are not material to us either in terms of annual cash flow or in total future minimum payments 
see note commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase commitments in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into purchase commitments for components  raw materials  supplies  services  finished camera products  and property  plant and equipment 
in the aggregate  such commitments are not at prices in excess of current market prices except for those instances in which the cost basis has been lowered to net realizable value and typically do not exceed one year 
related party transactions we engaged in related party transactions as discussed in note related party transactions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these transactions do not materially affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
other contractual obligations we do not have any material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity 
see hong kong financing facilities below for information about our financial guarantees 
hong kong financing facilities our hong kong subsidiary has various revolving demand financing facilities with the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation limited hsbc providing an aggregate of approximately million in borrowing capacity 
the revolving financing facilities are comprised of i an import facility of approximately million with a packing credit and export sub limit facility of approximately million  and ii a foreign exchange facility of approximately million collectively  the hong kong financing facilities 
the hong kong financing facilities are denominated in hong kong dollars 
since  the hong kong dollar has been pegged to the us dollar 
the company guarantees all of the amounts under the hong kong financing facilities 
pursuant to an agreement dated june   our hong kong subsidiary granted a security interest in substantially all of its assets to hsbc 
effective january   our hong kong subsidiary terminated and repaid its then outstanding revolving facility  denominated in euros  in an amount of approximately million decreased from january  quarter end due to foreign currency rate fluctuations constituting all obligations owed thereunder 
neither the company nor its hong kong subsidiary incurred any termination fees or penalties in connection with the repayment and termination of the revolving facility 
on or around february   the company and hsbc agreed  among other things  to reduce the company s borrowing capacity under the import facility from approximately million to approximately million  and to subordinate approximately million in inter company payables from the hong kong subsidiary to the company to any amounts owing or that may in the future become owing to hsbc by the hong kong subsidiary 
the hong kong financing facilities are subject to certain covenants  and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of july  and july  the hong kong financing facilities bear interest at variable rates 
at july   we had million short term borrowings under the import facility 
at july   we had million and million in short term borrowings outstanding under the revolving facility and import facility  respectively 
the weighted average borrowing rates on the short term borrowings as of july  and july   were and  respectively 
we are currently in discussions with hsbc regarding reducing the availability of the financing facilities and providing additional security in the form of cash 
exchange offer on august   we launched an offer to exchange outstanding stock options that had an exercise price of more than per share for new options to purchase of the shares subject to the outstanding options at an exercise price of per share representing the closing price of the common stock reported on the nasdaq nms on the date the board of directors approved the exchange offer 
the exchange offer expired on october  we accepted for exchange and cancelled options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock and issued new options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock in exchange for the cancelled options 
as a result of the exchange offer  we are now required to apply variable accounting to these new stock options until the options are exercised  cancelled or expired unless the price of our common stock at fiscal year end is less than the exercise price of the repriced stock options 
for fiscal  we did not record any variable stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations because the stock price of our common stock on july  was below the exercise price of 
for fiscal  variable stock based compensation income was million because the company s stock price on july  was lower than the price of our common stock used to compute variable stock based compensation expense in previous quarters 
for fiscal  we recorded million of variable stock based compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations because our closing common stock price on june  was above the exercise price of 
because the determination of variable accounting expense associated with the repriced stock options is dependent  in part  on our closing stock price at the end of each prospective reporting period  it is not possible to determine its future impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on our results of operations 
senior notes in fiscal  we consummated a private placement of million of unsecured senior notes that bore interest at 
during fiscal  we repurchased all of these senior notes at slightly below par 
license agreements see note commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
intellectual property claims see note commitments and contingencies and note litigation and settlements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
growth opportunities we are evaluating various growth opportunities that could require significant funding commitments 
we have from time to time held  and will continue to hold  discussions and negotiations with i companies that represent potential acquisition or investment opportunities  ii potential strategic and financial investors who have expressed an interest in making an investment in or acquiring us  iii potential joint venture partners looking toward formation of strategic alliances that would broaden our product base or enable us to enter new lines of business  and iv potential new customers where the design  development and production of new products  including certain new technologies  would enable us to expand our existing business and enter new markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that any definitive agreement will be reached regarding any of the foregoing 
recent events it has recently come to our attention that in fiscal and fiscal  certain foreign subsidiaries inadvertently sold approximately  and  respectively  of our products that were shipped to cuba  iran and syria 
one of more of the shipments may be in violation of regulations of the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control ofac 
we intend to inform the us treasury department of these matters and to take steps to ensure future compliance with all ofac regulations 
to the extent we violated any regulations with respect to the above or other transactions  we may be subject to civil fines or other sanctions  which we believe will not be material 
we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks regarding our company 
these and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report 
there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
our internal control may be insufficient to detect in a timely manner misstatements that could occur in our financial statements in amounts that may be material 
during fiscal  we identified eight material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
for a discussion of the material weaknesses  see item a  controls and procedures below 
we have taken the following steps to remediate our material weaknesses erp system 
we have committed and continue to commit significant financial resources and it personnel resources  whose primary functions are to identify and remediate erp system issues to resolving issues 
it controls 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal and continuing into fiscal  we took certain remedial actions to address deficiencies in our general it controls  including changes to the configuration of the system and implementation of security and data protection policies  procedures and controls 
additional personnel 
we are actively seeking to hire additional  qualified finance and accounting staff with significant depth and expertise to supplement existing personnel  including a director of internal audit 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also retained a financial consultant to advise us on the organization and composition of the finance and accounting department 
foreign currency translation 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated training of our financial staff in the utilization of the foreign currency functionality within the erp system and implemented a system enhancement designed to mitigate the possibility of errors 
asset impairment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented additional procedures and levels of approval to timely assess impairment indicators of long lived assets 
engagement of outside consultants 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we engaged the services of a significant number of outside consultants to assist us in documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting 
additional steps 
we performed significant additional manual controls  processes and procedures designed to ensure the integrity of our financial reporting process and to ensure that our financial statements fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and results of operation of the company in accordance with us gaap 
despite these steps  we may experience significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future  which  if not remediated  may render us unable to detect in a timely manner misstatements that could occur in our financial statements in amounts that may be material 
we cannot assure you that our independent registered public accounting firm will determine that the material weaknesses have been remedied by the end of fiscal our business strategies may not succeed 
during the normal course of our business  we evaluate  develop and implement various short term and long term business strategies 
some of these strategies  if implemented  may require significant financial and human resources 
there can be no assurance that any such strategies  if implemented  will be successful 
if such strategies do not succeed  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
specifically  we may not be successful in implementing our restructuring initiatives and cost reduction initiatives 
in december  we implemented restructuring initiatives that  among other things  were designed to eliminate our reliance on internally designed and manufactured digital cameras and increase the design  co development and purchase of digital cameras from outsourced manufacturers 
we incurred significant restructuring charges and expenses as a result of the restructuring initiatives in fiscal and may incur additional charges 
in addition  as a result of our continued evaluation of our cost structure and the on going strategic review process  we reduced certain additional costs including  among other things  eliminating certain employee positions and consolidating certain of our operations in the united kingdom  france and germany to our offices in jena  germany 
the expected benefits from these initiatives are subject to many estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to  assumptions regarding i the amount and timing of cost reductions we can achieve  ii our ability to develop and maintain relationships with outsourced manufacturers for the design  co development and purchase of digital camera products  iii our ability to meet customer demands and fulfill customer service obligations  and iv the costs and timing of activities undertaken in connection with these initiatives 
in addition  these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic  competitive and other uncertainties that are beyond our control 
if these assumptions are not realized  or if other unforeseen events occur  the initiatives may not be successful and our results of operations and our ability to compete in the image capture industry could be adversely affected 
see note restructuring and other charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if we continue to incur substantial losses  we may not have sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs 
although we believe that we have sufficient working capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months  our ability to fund our operating requirements and maintain an adequate level of working capital and liquidity may be impaired if we continue to incur losses and fail to generate substantial growth in sales of our products and fail to control operating expenses 
if we require funding to meet our cash flow needs  we may seek to obtain such funding through  among other things  loans or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or by issuing debt that is convertible into equity  existing shareholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage 
moreover  additional funding or capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
we face significant risks related to the digital  single use and mm traditional film camera markets 
based upon available third party market research data  the digital camera market is expected to continue to grow in the united states and europe for a number of years but then flatten  the mm traditional film camera market has been in decline and is expected to continue to decline  and the single use camera market is expected to flatten through calendar and then decline 
there is no assurance that our digital and single use camera sales will increase  or that  even if they do increase  they will be profitable or that we will be able to maintain our market share in each of the digital  single use and mm traditional film camera markets 
we are dependent on a small number of customers 
we have a small number of customers that represent a high percentage of our revenues 
our products are sold in very competitive markets 
our competitors may adopt more aggressive policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products  which could result in a loss of sales or of customers 
the loss of sales or of one or more of these important customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the camera and photographic products industry is highly competitive 
as a manufacturer  marketer and distributor of low cost  popularly priced image capture products  we encounter intense competition from a number of companies  including without limitation  canon  fuji  hewlett packard  kodak  olympus  nikon  sony  pentax  konica minolta  panasonic  samsung and vivitar  each of which has or may have longer operating histories  more established markets  better brand recognition  more extensive facilities and  in some cases  greater resources than us 
maintaining a competitive advantage against our competitors depends on our ability to develop and manufacture or purchase from outsourced manufacturers high quality products at the lowest cost 
these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes  price reductions  and or increased operating costs  such as for marketing and sales incentives  resulting in lower revenues  gross margins and income 
digital camera products are subject to rapid technological changes  price erosion  obsolescence and higher rates of returns and allowances 
digital camera products are subject to rapid technological changes  price erosion  rapid obsolescence and rates of returns and allowances to a greater extent than mm traditional film and single use camera products 
when our average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we sell more units  and our gross profits and margins decline unless we are able to reduce our product costs by commensurate amounts and percentages or find new customers 
to be successful in the market  we have to respond quickly to technological advances and market conditions and manage our inventory effectively to accommodate price declines and erosion resulting from such factors as competition and the short life span of such products 
due to price competition  allowances for digital cameras are considerably higher than those provided to customers for traditional and single use cameras 
these uncertainties  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on our gross profits and profit margins 
digital camera products involve more complex design  development and manufacturing processes  and we are dependent upon the continued availability of finished digital camera products 
we currently purchase all of our digital camera products from outsourced manufacturers for sale to our rsd customers worldwide 
digital cameras involve more complex design  development  manufacturing and product procurement processes and component procurement processes than mm traditional film and single use cameras 
production delays by outsourced manufacturers including delays or shortages and their timely introduction and delivery of new products  which may be outside our control  could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any disruption in the availability of products or in our suppliers ability to deliver quality products in time to meet critical distribution schedules could adversely affect our ability to achieve our sales objectives 
we may experience a short supply of certain products as a result of problems experienced by our suppliers 
if shortages or delays persist  the price of products may increase  products may not be available  and we may be exposed to component and or product quality issues 
we may not be able to secure sufficient products at reasonable prices or acceptable quality in a timely manner in the quantities needed 
accordingly  our revenue  gross profits  margins and market share could suffer until other sources can be developed 
we depend on third party suppliers  and our revenue  gross profits and margins could suffer if we fail to manage supplier issues properly 
our manufacturing  sales and distribution operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components and products and our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components and products at reasonable prices in time to meet critical manufacturing  sales and distribution schedules 
given the variety of products that we offer  the large number of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe  and the long lead times that are required to manufacture  assemble and deliver certain components and products  adverse circumstances  issues and problems could arise in planning production  procurement and managing inventory levels that could negatively impact our business and increase our financial exposure and risk 
other supplier problems that we could face include component and product shortages  excess supply  and risks related to fixed price contracts that would require us to pay more than the open market price  as more fully described below 
o supply shortages 
we may experience a short supply of  or a delay in receiving  certain components and products as a result of strong demand  capacity constraints or other problems experienced by suppliers 
if shortages or delays persist  the price of these components and products may increase  we may be exposed to quality issues or the components and products may not be available at all 
we may not be able to secure enough components and or products at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build  sell and distribute new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed 
accordingly  our revenue  gross profits and margins could suffer as we could lose time sensitive sales  incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers 
if we cannot adequately address supply issues  we may have to reengineer and or source some components and products  resulting in further costs and delays 
o oversupply 
in order to secure products or components for the production of new products  at times we may make advance payments to suppliers  or we may enter into non cancelable commitments with suppliers 
if we fail to adequately anticipate customer demand properly  an oversupply of products and or components could result in potential excess or obsolete inventory 
this potential excess or obsolete inventory may result in lowering the carrying value of these components and or products by recording an inventory charge which could adversely affect our gross profits and margins 
o long term pricing commitments 
as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers  we may be obligated to purchase components and or products at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions 
in the event that we become committed to purchase components and or products for prices in excess of the current market price  we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components and or products at lower prices 
this excess of current market price may result in lowering the carrying value of those components and or products by recording an inventory charge which could adversely affect our gross profits and margins 
in many instances we rely on offshore suppliers  including  but not limited to  manufacturers in the prc for the production of cameras and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 
regional economic  business  environmental  political  medical  or military conditions or events could disrupt supplies in foreign locations 
we ceased manufacturing digital cameras at the end of fiscal we began purchasing digital camera products exclusively from outsourced manufacturers in the first quarter of fiscal the risks identified above will be significant as a result of our purchases of products from these manufacturers 
we are dependent on third party service providers to provide distribution facilities for all of our operations in the united states  latin america and europe 
the warehousing and distribution services for our i united states and latin american operations are handled from a single distribution facility operated by a third party service provider in san pedro  california  and ii european operations are handled from a single distribution facility operated by a third party service provider in moerdijk  the netherlands 
in fiscal  we plan to utilize a third party service provider in canada to service our canadian customers 
our products are prepared for shipment and shipped to our customers by such third party service providers at these distribution facilities 
any failure by these third party service providers to maintain a regular flow of products from us to our customers or any significant interruption in the business of these service providers or the operation of these distribution facilities due to natural disasters  accidents  system failures  work stoppages or other causes would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the implementation of a new erp system represents a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
during august  we converted from our existing legacy systems to a new erp system 
this design and implementation project began in july and now includes our accounting  financial and operating functions and systems  including sales  supply chain and manufacturing systems 
implementing the erp system involved significant costs  in terms of both the financial and human resources incurred and expended 
as disclosed in this report and in earlier reports filed with the sec  the ineffective planning and implementation of the erp system constitutes a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
see item a  controls and procedures below 
if we are unsuccessful in remediating this material weakness within a reasonable time  our reliance on the erp system could continue to interfere with our ability to file our periodic reports with the sec on a timely basis and continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to manage our business 
most of our operations in the prc are subject to regulation by local governmental agencies 
the continuing viability of our prc agreements is critical to our business operations in the prc 
we manufacture a large number of the components used in our cameras and assemble all of our own manufactured finished products at our facilities in the prc 
during fiscal  based upon production demand  we had approximately  to  workers at our manufacturing facilities in the prc either employed by our prc subsidiary or provided through our agreements with various prc government or quasi government entities 
we are responsible for their wages  food and housing and must comply with a variety of local labor and employee benefit laws covering these workers 
while we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws as currently enforced  these laws are subject to modification and interpretation by local governmental authorities 
we cannot predict the effect of any future modifications to or strict enforcement of the existing laws 
in addition  the termination or material modification of any of our agreements with the prc governmental or quasi government entities could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with sales to our customers 
we sell a significant number of products to a small number of customers 
receivables arising from these sales are generally not collateralized 
we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and review outstanding receivable balances for collectibility on a regular basis and record provisions for doubtful accounts  allowances and returns  as necessary 
in the past  we have had customers file for protection from their creditors under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  we have recognized provisions related to accounts receivable and inventory 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations above 
if we are unable to collect or timely collect outstanding receivables from our customers or our customers seek protection from their creditors under the bankruptcy code or applicable foreign bankruptcy regulations  our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
we are exposed to risks associated with intellectual property used in image capture devices 
image capture devices use technology which may be protected by united states or foreign patents 
the right to use such intellectual property is subject to the availability of licenses from the owners of the intellectual property 
if licenses are not available  or are only available on onerous terms  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the defense of infringement claims could be time consuming and costly 
third parties also may claim that we  or the customers we indemnify  are infringing upon their intellectual property rights 
even if we believe that the claims are without merit  the claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
claims of intellectual property infringement also may require us to redesign affected products  enter into costly settlement or license agreements  pay costly damage awards or cease marketing of certain products subject to the claims 
even if we have an agreement with a third party to indemnify us against such costs  the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations to us 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source  our operations could suffer 
from time to time  we receive patent infringement claims which we analyze and  if appropriate  take action to avoid infringement  settle the claim or negotiate a license 
those claims for which legal proceedings have been initiated against us are discussed in item  legal proceedings and in note litigation and settlements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also received notifications from three entities  one of which was a significant customer  alleging that certain of our digital cameras infringe upon those entities respective patents 
we are engaged in discussions with these three entities regarding resolution of the claims 
based on our initial assessment of the first two claims  infringement of one or more patents is probable if the patents are valid 
based upon the licensing discussions to date  we preliminarily estimate the potential royalties due to these two claimants for digital camera sales through july  to be between and approximately million in the aggregate 
the actual royalty amounts  if any  for past and future sales are dependent upon the outcome of the negotiations 
we have notified certain of our suppliers of our right to be indemnified by the suppliers in the event we are required to pay royalties or damages to either claimant 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount of the potential loss  if any  within the range of estimates relating to these claims 
accordingly  no amounts have been accrued related to these claims as of july  with respect to the third claim  it is too early to assess the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome or the loss or range of loss  if any  and therefore  no amounts have been accrued relating to this claim as of july  we are assessing potential claims of indemnification against certain of our suppliers with respect to this claim 
our ability to manufacture and sell single use cameras depends on our licensing agreement with fuji 
our business is substantially dependent on our license from fuji  which granted us a worldwide excluding japan until january   non exclusive right to use certain fuji patents and patent applications related to single use cameras 
the license extends until the later of the expiration of the last of the licensed fuji patents or february  after the term of the license expires  we expect to continue to be able to manufacture and sell single use cameras without a license 
if  however  the license is terminated prior to the expiration of the patents  we may not be able to continue to manufacture and sell single use cameras and  as a result  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we are exposed to political  economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 
we have significant operations outside the united states 
we currently have operations in hong kong  japan  the prc  canada  the united kingdom  france and germany 
further  we obtain raw materials  components and finished camera products from foreign suppliers 
accordingly  our business is subject to the political  economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in foreign countries 
these risks include  but are not limited to o the difficulty of enforcing agreements  collecting receivables and protecting assets through foreign legal systems  o trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  o the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions  o difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations  o required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  o changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate  particularly in emerging markets  and o increased costs and risks of doing business in a number of foreign jurisdictions 
our business depends in part on our ability to successfully anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks 
we cannot assure you that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
relocation time and expenses could result in substantial losses 
if we determine it is necessary to relocate our manufacturing facilities from the prc  or to another location within the prc  due to confiscation  expropriation  nationalization  embargoes  governmental restrictions or for other regulatory  business and or financial reasons  we would incur substantial operating and capital losses including losses resulting from business interruption and delays in production 
in addition  as a result of a relocation of our manufacturing equipment and other assets  we may incur relatively higher manufacturing costs  which could reduce sales and decrease the gross profits and margins on the products we manufacture 
relocation of our manufacturing operations could also result in disruption in the delivery of our products  which could  in turn  reduce demand for our products in the future 
we are exposed to interest rate and exchange rate risk 
as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rates and interest rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
exchange rates and interest rates in certain markets in which we do business tend to be more volatile than those in the united states and western europe 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency and our products may be less competitive in that country 
we generally do not engage in currency hedging activities 
the prc government announced on july  that its currency will no longer be pegged to the us dollar 
instead  the exchange rates for the chinese yuan  or renminbi  will be determined by a basket of foreign currencies 
this change effected a de facto revaluation of the yuan to the us dollar from yuan to yuan per us dollar 
currently  we generate nominal net sales valued in renminbi 
net sales recorded in hong kong are denominated in hong kong dollars  the exchange rate of which has not been affected by the yuan revaluation and is still pegged to the us dollar 
we expect that the revaluation may initially have an immaterial negative effect on our manufacturing operations in the prc by immaterially increasing our cost of doing business in the prc 
the interest rate related to our hong kong financing facilities is based on a spread over the singapore interbank offered rate sibor 
a significant change in the sibor rate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
currently  we are not utilizing any interest rate protection agreements to limit our exposure to this risk 
we may experience liquidity issues if our reliance on financing facilities increases 
our primary source of liquidity has been provided by our short term investments  reductions in working capital balances and borrowing availability under our million hong kong financing facilities 
we are currently in discussion with hsbc regarding reducing the availability under the hong kong financing facilities 
due to recent losses  our level of reliance on our hong kong financing facilities could increase and  as a result  create liquidity issues for us due to potential funding limits and debt service requirements imposed by lenders 
a significant increase in our indebtedness could increase costs and interfere with our ability to operate our business effectively and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a delisting of our common stock could have a substantial effect on the price and liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to access capital markets 
as a result of the material weaknesses that we have identified in this report and in earlier reports filed with the sec  including  among others  the material weaknesses in our financial statement closing process and in our erp system  we were unable to timely file our quarterly reports on form q during fiscal should we continue to experience such difficulties in filing our reports on time  we cannot assure you that our common stock will not be delisted from nasdaq nms  that we will be able to meet or satisfy all conditions and requirements for continued listing or that nasdaq nms will not initiate delisting proceedings in the future if we are unable to file future periodic reports on time or comply with other listing requirements 
a delisting of our common stock could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock that may result in a material reduction in our per share price of our common stock 
in addition  any such delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us  or at all  and may result in the loss of confidence in our financial stability by suppliers  customers and employees 
if our securities are delisted from nasdaq nms  we may face a lengthy process to relist our securities if we are able to relist them at all 
we are dependent on a small group of key personnel 
our business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel 
the loss of key management and operating personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business 
we believe our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract highly skilled and qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not be able to hire the necessary personnel to implement our business strategies  or we may need to pay higher compensation for employees than currently budgeted and or anticipated in the future 
our inability to attract and retain such personnel could limit our growth and affect our results of operations 
international trade restrictions could adversely affect our business and growth 
the united states  the prc  hong kong  the european union or other countries where we do business may impose trade restrictions that could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  the united states is currently monitoring various prc practices  including trade  investment and government procurement  as well as the prc s compliance with various multilateral and bilateral agreements 
we cannot predict whether the united states will take future trade actions against the prc that may result in increased tariffs against prc products  including products that we import 
our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters  business interruptions or similar events 
disasters such as hurricanes  typhoons  earthquakes  or acts of nature or god  terrorist attacks  water  fire  electricity failure  or accidents affecting our operating activities  facilities  and employees and customers health could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in particular  our operations in the prc  as well as most of our outsourced manufacturers  suppliers and service providers involved in the manufacturing of components and products are located within a relatively close proximity of one another in the prc 
therefore  any disaster that strikes within close proximity of that geographic area could disrupt our business and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not currently have a disaster recovery plan 
in the event of another outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  or some other disease or health related issue  our facilities and or the facilities of our outsourced manufacturers and service providers located in hong kong  the prc and other parts of the world could be quarantined  temporarily closed or disrupted 
if such an outbreak occurs  it could delay or prevent us from developing new products or manufacturing  testing or shipping our current or future products  and may require us to find other providers of such services and or products  which may be unavailable or more expensive 
further  if a sars outbreak has an adverse impact on the businesses of our customers  it could reduce the size and or frequency of our customers purchases  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
our future income tax rates could increase 
a number of factors will affect our income tax rate in the future  and the combined effect of these factors could result in an increase in our effective income tax rate as compared to our effective income tax rate in fiscal this potential increase in future effective income tax rates would adversely affect net income in future periods 
we operate in different countries that have different income tax rates 
based upon our apportionment of income  our effective income tax rate could fluctuate 
changes in income tax laws in the united states or countries where we presently have operations may further limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses 
any further limitation on our ability to utilize our net operating losses could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to identify and integrate future acquisitions 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions that we consider reasonable in light of the revenues and the results of operations we believe we will be able to achieve  from these acquisitions  once combined and integrated with the company 
the cost of acquisitions within the industry has generally increased over time 
additionally  we compete for acquisitions with certain other industry competitors  some of which have greater financial and other resources than us 
increased demand for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition prices 
although we believe opportunities may exist for us to grow through acquisitions  we may not be able to identify and consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms 
if we do acquire another company or companies  we may not be able to profitably manage and successfully integrate the acquired company or companies with our operations  sales and marketing efforts without substantial costs or delays 
acquisitions involve a number of potential risks  including the potential loss of customers and contracts  increased leverage and debt service requirements  combining disparate company cultures and facilities and operating in geographically diverse markets 
an inability to identify and or integrate future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate 
the stock markets  and in particular the nasdaq nms  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of such companies 
these broad market movements may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in many instances  securities class action litigation has been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
such litigations have been instituted against us and could continue to result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
see note litigation and settlements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financing activities 
at july   our exposure to changes in interest rates was limited  since we had no significant debt outstanding 
since we have no significant debt outstanding  we do not deem interest rate risk to be significant or material to our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not presently use derivative instruments to adjust our interest rate risk profile 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we utilize leveraged financial instruments 
each of our foreign subsidiaries purchases their inventories in us dollars and certain of their sales are in foreign currency  thereby creating an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have purchased and continue to purchase in foreign currencies certain components  products  raw materials and services needed to manufacture and sell our products 
the impact of foreign exchange transactions is reflected in our statements of operations 
although we continue to analyze the benefits and costs associated with hedging against foreign currency fluctuations  as of july   we were not engaged in any hedging activities  and we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding
