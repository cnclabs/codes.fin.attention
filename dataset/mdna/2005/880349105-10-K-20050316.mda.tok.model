item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as you read the following review of our financial condition and results of operations  you should also read our financial statements and related notes beginning on page executive summary we are one of the world s leading manufacturers of automotive emission control and ride control products and systems 
we serve both original equipment vehicle manufacturers and the repair and replacement markets  or aftermarket  globally through leading brands  including monroe r  rancho r  clevite r elastomers and fric rot tm ride control products and walker r  fonos tm  and gillet tm emission control products 
worldwide we serve more than different original equipment manufacturers  and our products or systems are included on six of the top passenger car models produced in north american and western europe and all of the top light truck models produced in north america for during  our aftermarket customers were comprised of full line and specialty warehouse distributors  retailers  jobbers  installer chains and car dealers 
we operate more than manufacturing facilities worldwide and employ more than  people to service our customer s demands 
factors that are critical to our success include new business awards  managing our overall global manufacturing footprint to ensure proper placement and workforce levels in line with business needs  maintaining competitive wages and benefits  maximizing efficiencies in manufacturing processes  fixing or eliminating unprofitable businesses and reducing overall costs 
in addition  our ability to adapt to key industry trends  such as the consolidation of oe customers  increasing technologically sophisticated content  changing aftermarket distribution channels  increasing environmental standards and extended product life of automotive parts  also plays a critical role in our success 
other factors that are critical to our success include adjusting to environmental and economic challenges such as increases in the cost of raw materials and our ability to successfully reduce the impact of any such cost increases through material substitutions  cost reduction initiatives and other methods 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  with total debt  net of cash balances  of billion as of december  our ability to generate cash both to fund operations and service our debt is also a significant area of focus for our company 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of cash flows 
total revenues for were more than billion  an percent increase over higher oe volumes combined with favorable platform mix and strengthening currencies drove the majority of this increase 
gross margin for was percent of revenues compared to percent of revenues for strong growth in the global oe business outpaced the improvement in the higher gross margin aftermarket 
this shift in business mix coupled with increasing steel costs and restructuring activities more than offset the benefits being achieved through lean manufacturing  six sigma and ongoing restructuring initiatives 
we reported selling  general  administrative and engineering expenses for of percent of revenues  as compared to percent of revenues for this increase was driven by the impact of higher revenues being more than offset by higher aftermarket new customer changeover costs  restructuring and costs we paid in for stock appreciation rights granted to a consultant in for assisting us in implementing a compensation program based on economic value added 
earnings before interest expense  income taxes and minority interest ebit was million for  down from the million reported in the decrease was largely driven by stronger operating performance being more than offset by increasing steel prices and charges for restructuring and restructuring related activities  new aftermarket customer changeover costs and the consulting fees indexed to the stock price 
earnings per diluted share were in  compared to per diluted share in see below for a more detailed discussion of operating performances for the last three years 
in october  we announced a change in the structure of our organization that impacts our reportable segments 
the european segment now includes south american operations 
in addition  asia pacific is a new reportable segment that includes asian and australian operations 
the change in segment reporting has been reflected in this management discussion and analysis for years ended december  and prior 
in february  we announced the acquisition of substantially all the exhaust assets of gabilan manufacturing  inc  a privately held company that has developed and manufactured motorcycle exhaust systems for harley davidson motorcycles since the company also produces aftermarket muffler kits for harley davidson 
we purchased gabilan s assets for million in cash and expect the acquisition to be accretive within the first year 
gabilan generated approximately million in revenue in years and net sales and operating revenues the following tables reflect our revenues for the years of and we present these reconciliations of revenues in order to reflect the trend in our sales in various product lines and geographic regions separately from the effects of doing business in currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  pass through catalytic converter sales include precious metals pricing  which may be volatile 
these pass through catalytic converter sales occur when  at the direction of our oe customers  we purchase catalytic converters or components from suppliers  use them in our manufacturing process  and sell them as part of the completed system 
while our original equipment customers assume the risk of this volatility  it impacts our reported revenue 
excluding pass through catalytic converter sales removes this impact 
we have not reflected any currency impact in the table since this is the base period for measuring the effects of currency during on our operations 
we use this information to analyze the trend in our revenues before these factors 
we believe investors find this information useful in understanding period to period comparisons in our revenues

pass through emission control sales increased five percent to million in adjusted for pass through sales and currency  oe emission control sales were up one percent from the prior year 
oe ride control revenues for increased three percent from the prior year driven primarily by higher sales to heavy duty vehicle manufacturers 
total oe revenues  excluding pass through sales and currency  increased two percent in  while north american light vehicle production decreased approximately one percent from a year ago 
we experienced this improvement despite the build rate decline primarily due to new product launches and our strong position on top selling platforms with general motors  ford  daimlerchrysler  toyota  honda and nissan  as well as the higher heavy duty volumes 
aftermarket revenues for north america were million in  representing an increase of eight percent compared to the same period in the prior year 
aftermarket ride control revenues increased million or percent in  primarily due to orders from new customers  higher sales of premium priced products and  to a lesser degree  sales of our dupont tm branded car care appearance products launched earlier in for the last several years  revenues in the aftermarket emission control business have been declining due to the oe s use of stainless steel  which reduces aftermarket replacement rates

restructuring and other charges over the past several years we have adopted plans to restructure portions of our operations 
these plans were approved by the board of directors and were designed to reduce operational and administrative overhead costs throughout the business 
prior to the change in accounting required for exit or disposal activities  we recorded charges to income related to these plans for costs that do not benefit future activities in the period in which the plans were finalized and approved  while actions necessary to affect these restructuring plans occurred over future periods in accordance with established plans 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan  a project known as project genesis  designed to lower our fixed costs  improve efficiency and utilization  and better optimize our global footprint 
project genesis involved closing eight facilities  improving the process flow and efficiency through value mapping and plant arrangement at facilities  relocating production among facilities  and centralizing some functional areas 
the total of all these restructuring and other costs recorded in the fourth quarter of was million before tax  million after tax  or per diluted common share 
we eliminated positions in connection with project genesis 
additionally  we executed this plan more efficiently than originally anticipated and as a result in the fourth quarter of reduced our reserves related to this restructuring activity by million  which was recorded in cost of sales 
in the fourth quarter of  we reclassified million of severance reserve to the asset impairment reserve 
this reclassification became necessary as actual asset impairments along with the sale of our closed facilities were different than the original estimates 
we completed the remaining restructuring activities under project genesis as of the end of since project genesis was announced  we have undertaken a number of related projects designed to restructure our operations  described below 
in the first quarter of  we incurred severance costs of million associated with eliminating salaried positions through selective layoffs and an early retirement program 
additionally  hourly positions were eliminated through selective layoffs in the quarter 
these reductions were done to reduce ongoing labor costs in north america 
this charge was primarily recorded in cost of sales 
in october of  we announced the closing of an emission control manufacturing facility in birmingham  uk approximately employees were eligible for severance benefits in accordance with union contracts and uk legal requirements 
we incurred approximately million in costs related to this action in this action is in addition to the plant closings announced in project genesis in the fourth quarter of in october  we announced a plan to eliminate salaried positions through selected layoffs and an elective early retirement program 
the majority of the layoffs are at the middle and senior management level 
we expect to incur charges of approximately to million related to these reductions 
as of december   we have incurred million in severance costs 
of this total  million was recorded in cost of sales and million was recorded in selling  general and administrative 
we anticipate incurring the remaining costs by april of of the total million in severance costs incurred to date  million represents cash payments with the remainder accrued in other short term liabilities 
we expect to generate savings of approximately million annually from this initiative 
including the above costs  we incurred million in restructuring and restructuring related costs in of this total  million related to the continuation of the optimization of our manufacturing footprint that was started with project genesis in including the costs incurred in and of million  we have incurred a total of million for activities related to our restructuring actions initiated in prior periods that could not be accrued as part of the restructuring charges for these actions 
we have generated about million of annual savings from project genesis 
approximately million of savings was related to closing the eight facilities  approximately million of savings was related to value mapping and plant arrangement and approximately million of savings was related to relocating production among facilities and centralizing some functional areas 
there have been no significant deviations from planned savings 
all actions for project genesis have been completed 
under the terms of our amended and restated senior credit agreement that took effect on december   we are allowed to exclude up to million of cash charges and expenses  before taxes  related to cost reduction initiatives over the to time period from the calculation of the financial covenant ratios we are required to maintain under our senior credit agreement 
as of december   we have excluded million of the million available under the terms of the senior credit facility 
in addition to the announced actions  we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to initiate actions that will reduce our costs through implementing the most appropriate and efficient logistics  distribution and manufacturing footprint for the future 
there can be no assurances  however  that we will undertake additional restructuring actions 
actions that we take  if any  will require the approval of our board of directors  or its authorized committee  and if the costs of the plans exceed the amount previously approved by our senior lenders  could require approval by our senior lenders 
we plan to conduct any workforce reductions that result in compliance with all legal and contractual requirements including obligations to consult with workers councils  union representatives and others 
in february of  we amended our senior credit facility 
as amended  we are allowed to exclude up to million of cash charges and expenses  before taxes  related to restructuring initiatives occurring after february from the calculation of the financial covenant ratios required under our senior credit facility 
interest expense  net of interest capitalized we reported interest expense of million in compared to million in interest expense for includes million related to the refinancing of our million percent senior subordinated notes due we accomplished this refinancing by issuing new percent senior subordinated notes due in november and using the net proceeds of that issuance  together with cash on hand  to redeem our percent notes 
the percent notes were called for redemption in november and the redemption was completed in december 
included in the total is a write off of million in debt issuance costs  a premium of million for redeeming the bonds prior to their maturity date  and million in overlapping interest expenses during the time between the issuance of the percent notes and the final redemption of the percent notes 
last year s interest expense includes million for the write off of senior debt issuance costs that were deferred on the senior debt that we partially paid with the proceeds of our million bond offering in june of and fully refinanced in december of see more detailed explanations on our debt structure  including our issuance of million of percent senior subordinated notes due in november  our issuance of million of percent senior secured notes due in june  our issuance of million of percent senior secured notes due in december and our refinancing of our senior credit facility in december and their anticipated impact on our interest expense  in liquidity and capital resources capitalization later in this management s discussion and analysis 
in april  we entered into three separate fixed to floating interest rate swaps with two separate financial institutions 
these agreements swapped an aggregate of million of fixed interest rate debt at a per annum rate of percent to floating interest rate debt at a per annum rate of libor plus a spread of percent 
each agreement requires semi annual settlements through july  the libor in effect for these swaps during the course of resulted in lower interest expense of approximately million for the year 
the libor rate as of december  as determined under these agreements is percent 
this rate remained in effect until january  when it increased to percent 
based upon the libor of percent which was in effect as of january  under these agreements and remains in effect until july   these swaps would reduce our annual interest expense by approximately million 
these swaps qualify as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and as such are recorded on the balance sheet at market value with an offset to the underlying hedged item  which is long term debt 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately million  which has been recorded as a decrease to long term debt and an increase to other long term liabilities 
income taxes income taxes were a benefit of million in  compared to a benefit of million in included in were benefits of million  including book to return adjustments  settlements of prior year tax issues and benefits related to previous tax losses in foreign operations 
due to efforts to improve overseas operations  we can now recognize the benefits of these previous tax losses in foreign operations  because it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize them to offset future cash tax payments 
included in were benefits of million  including book to return adjustments  settlements of prior year tax issues on a more favorable basis than originally anticipated and a foreign tax adjustment 
the effective tax rate for including the million benefit was percent 
excluding the million benefit our effective tax rate was percent 
the effective tax rate for including the million benefit was a negative percent 
excluding the million benefit our effective tax rate was percent

critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for sales to our oe and aftermarket customers under the terms of our arrangements with those customers  generally at the time of shipment from our plants or distribution centers 
for our aftermarket customers  we provide for promotional incentives and returns at the time of sale 
estimates are based upon the terms of the incentives and historical experience with returns 
where we have offered product warranty  we also provide for warranty costs 
those estimates are based upon historical experience and upon specific warranty issues as they arise 
while we have not experienced any material differences between these estimates and our actual costs  it is reasonably possible that future warranty issues could arise that could have a significant impact on our financial statements 
long term receivables we expense pre production design and development costs incurred for our original equipment customers unless we have a contractual guarantee for reimbursement of those costs from the customer 
at december   we had million recorded as a long term receivable from oe customers for guaranteed pre production design and development arrangements 
while we believe that the vehicle programs behind these arrangements will enter production  these arrangements allow us to recover our pre production design and development costs in the event that the programs are cancelled or do not reach expected production levels 
we have not experienced any material losses on arrangements where we have a contractual guarantee of reimbursement from our customers 
income taxes we have a us federal tax net operating loss nol carryforward at december   of million  which will expire in varying amounts from to the federal tax effect of that nol is million  and is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet at december  we estimate  based on available evidence both positive and negative  that it is more likely than not that we will utilize the nol within the prescribed carryforward period 
that estimate is based upon our expectations regarding future taxable income of our us operations and upon strategies available to accelerate usage of the nol 
circumstances that could change that estimate include future us earnings at lower than expected levels or a majority ownership change as defined in the rules of the us tax law 
if that estimate changed  we would be required to cease recognizing an income tax benefit for any new nol and could be required to record a reserve for some or all of the asset currently recorded on our balance sheet 
as of december   we believe that there has been a significant change in our ownership  but not a majority change  in the last three years 
stock based compensation we utilize the intrinsic value method to account for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
if our compensation costs for our stock based compensation plans were determined using the fair value method of accounting as provided in the revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we estimate that our pro forma net income and earnings per share would be lower by approximately million or per diluted share for the full year and by approximately million or per diluted share for the full year goodwill and other intangible assets we utilize an impairment only approach to value our purchased goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
each year in the fourth quarter  we perform an impairment analysis on the balance of goodwill 
inherent in this calculation is the use of estimates as the fair value of our designated reporting units is based upon the present value of our expected future cash flows 
in addition  our calculation includes our best estimate of our weighted average cost of capital and growth rate 
if the calculation results in a fair value of goodwill which is less than the book value of goodwill  an impairment charge would be recorded in the operating results of the impaired reporting unit 
we had million of goodwill recorded at december  pension and other postretirement benefits we have various defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
we also have postretirement health care and life insurance plans that cover a majority of our domestic employees 
our pension and postretirement health care and life insurance expenses and valuations are dependent on management s assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
health care cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data and an assessment of likely long term trends 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
our approach to establishing the discount rate assumption for both our domestic and foreign plans starts with high quality investment grade bonds adjusted for an incremental yield based on actual historical performance 
this incremental yield adjustment is the result of selecting securities whose yields are higher than the normal bonds that comprise the index 
based on this approach  at september  we lowered the weighted average discount rate for pension plans to percent  from percent 
the discount rate for postretirement benefits was lowered from percent at september  to percent at september  our approach to determining expected return on plan asset assumptions evaluates both historical returns as well as estimates of future returns  and is adjusted for any expected changes in the long term outlook for the equity and fixed income markets 
as a result  our estimate of the weighted average long term rate of return on plan assets for our pension plans was percent for  and see note to the financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 
generally  our pension plans are non contributory 
our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable us and foreign government regulations and to make additional payments as funds are available to achieve full funding of the accumulated benefit obligation 
at december   all legal funding requirements had been met 
employees contributed million to our pension plans in and less than million in other postretirement benefit obligations  such as retiree medical  are not funded 
funded status is derived by subtracting the value of the projected benefit obligations at december   from the end of the year fair value of plan assets 
changes in accounting principles in january  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued interpretation no

liquidity and capital resources capitalization year ended december  change millions short term debt and current maturities long term debt   total debt   total minority interest shareholders equity total capitalization   general 
the year to date increase in shareholders equity primarily results from million related to the translation of foreign balances into us dollars 
in addition  net income  premium on common stock issued pursuant to benefit plans and other transactions contributed million to the increase in shareholders equity 
the increase in shareholders equity was partially offset by an adjustment to the additional minimum pension liability of million as a result of an increase in the accrued benefit obligation 
although our book equity balance was small at december   it should not affect our business operations 
we have no debt covenants that are based upon our book equity  and there are no other agreements that are adversely impacted by our relatively low book equity 
short term debt  which includes the current portion of long term obligations and borrowings by foreign subsidiaries  as well as our revolving credit facility  decreased approximately million as a result of a million increase in the current portion of long term debt offset by a million decrease in foreign subsidiaries obligations 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at either december  or the overall decrease in long term debt resulted from payments made on our outstanding long term debt and capital leases in addition to our position on interest rate swaps entered into in april see below for further information on the interest rate swaps 
senior credit facility overview and recent transactions 
our financing arrangements are primarily provided by a committed senior secured financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions 
the arrangement is secured by substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of percent of the stock of certain first tier foreign subsidiaries  as well as guarantees by our material domestic subsidiaries 
we originally entered into this facility in and since that time have periodically requested and received amendments to the facility for various purposes 
in december of  we engaged in a series of transactions that resulted in the full refinancing of the facility  through an amendment and restatement 
as of december   the senior credit facility consisted of a seven year  million term loan b facility maturing in december  a five year  million revolving credit facility maturing in december  and a seven year  million tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility maturing in december in february  we amended the facility  which resulted in reduced interest rates on the term loan b and tranche b letter of credit revolving loan portions of the facility 
we also made a voluntary prepayment of million on the term loan b facility  reducing borrowings to million 
these transactions are described in more detail below 
in june  we issued million of percent senior secured notes 
the notes have a final maturity date of july  we received net proceeds in the second quarter of from the offering of the notes  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses  of million 
we used the net proceeds of the offering to repay outstanding amounts under our senior credit facility as follows i to prepay million on the term loan a that was due november   ii to prepay million on the term loans b and c that was due november  and may   respectively  and iii to prepay outstanding borrowings of million under the revolving credit portion of our senior credit facility 
these notes are described in more detail below under senior secured and subordinated notes 
in december  we amended and restated our senior credit facility and issued an additional million of percent senior secured notes 
we received million of net proceeds from the offering of the additional million of percent senior secured notes  after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses and including a percent price premium over par 
we also received million in net proceeds from new term loan b borrowings under the amended and restated senior credit facility  after deducting fees and other expenses 
we used the combined net proceeds of million to prepay the remaining million outstanding under term loans a  b and c under the senior credit facility immediately prior to the completion of the transaction 
the remaining million of net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
we incurred million in fees associated with the issuance of the aggregate million of percent senior secured notes and the amendment and restatement of our senior credit facility 
these fees will be amortized over the term of the senior secured notes and the amended and restated senior credit facility 
based on our use of the net proceeds from both the june and december transactions  these transactions would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately million 
this does not give effect to the fixed to floating interest rate swaps we completed in april  described below 
in addition  we expensed in the second and fourth quarters of a total of approximately million of existing deferred debt issuance costs as a result of retiring the term loans under the senior credit facility 
in april  we entered into three separate fixed to floating interest rate swaps with two separate financial institutions 
these agreements swapped an aggregate of million of fixed interest rate debt at a per annum rate of percent to floating interest rate debt at a per annum rate of libor plus a spread of percent 
each agreement requires semi annual settlements through july  the libor in effect for these swaps during the course of resulted in lower interest expense of approximately million for the year 
the libor rate as of december  as determined under these agreements is percent 
this rate remained in effect until january  when it increased to percent 
based upon the libor of percent which was in effect as of january  under these agreements and remains in effect until july   these swaps would reduce our annual interest expense by approximately million 
these swaps qualify as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and as such are recorded on the balance sheet at market value with an offset to the underlying hedged item  which is long term debt 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately million  which has been recorded as a decrease to long term debt and an increase to other long term liabilities 
in november  we refinanced our million of percent senior subordinated notes maturing in october of with new senior subordinated notes 
the new notes have an interest rate of percent  a maturity date of november  and contain substantially similar terms as the notes refinanced 
premium payments and other fees in connection with the refinancing of these notes totaled approximately million  including a million or price premium over par on the redeemed notes 
the new notes accrue interest from november  with an initial interest payment date of may  these notes are described in more detail below under senior secured and subordinated notes 
in connection with the refinancing of the million in senior subordinated notes we amended the senior credit facility effective november  this amendment allowed us to use up to million in cash on hand to pay redemption premiums and or other fees and costs in connection with the redemption and refinancing of the senior subordinated notes 
this amendment also excluded any redemption premium associated with the percent senior subordinated notes and any interest incurred on the notes between the call date of november  and the redemption date of december  from cash interest expense for purposes of the definition of consolidated interest expense in the senior credit facility 
in exchange for these amendments  we agreed to pay a small fee to the consenting lenders 
we also incurred approximately million in legal  advisory and other costs related to the amendment and the issuance of the new senior subordinated notes 
these amounts were capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining terms of the senior subordinated notes and senior credit facility 
our interest expense increased in by million due to the fees and expenses associated with the refinancing of our senior subordinated notes  which includes an expense of million for existing deferred debt issuance costs associated with the percent senior subordinated notes 
beginning in  annual interest expense savings from this transaction are anticipated to be about million 
this does not give effect to the fixed to floating interest rate swaps we completed in april described above 
in february we amended our senior credit facility to reduce by basis points the interest rate on the term loan b facility and the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility 
in connection with the amendment  we voluntarily prepaid million in principal on the term loan b  reducing the term loan b facility from million to million 
additional provisions of the amendment to the senior credit facility agreement i amend the definition of ebitda to exclude up to million in restructuring related expenses announced and taken after february  ii increase permitted investments to million  iii exclude expenses related to the issuance of stock options from the definition of consolidated net income  iv permit us to redeem up to million of senior secured notes after january  subject to certain conditions  v increase our ability to add commitments under the revolving credit facility by million  and vi make other minor modifications 
we incurred approximately million in fees and expenses associated with this amendment  which will be capitalized and amortized over the remaining term of the agreement 
as a result of the amendment and the voluntary prepayment of million under the term loan b  our interest expense in will be approximately million lower than what it would otherwise have been 
senior credit facility forms of credit provided 
following the february voluntary prepayment of million  the term loan b facility is payable as follows million due march   and million due each of june  september and december  the revolving credit facility requires that it be repaid by december prior to that date  funds may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed under the revolving credit facility without premium or penalty 
letters of credit may be issued under the revolving credit facility 
the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility requires that it be repaid by december we can borrow revolving loans from the million tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility and use that facility to support letters of credit 
the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility lenders have deposited million with the administrative agent  who has invested that amount in time deposits 
we do not have an interest in any of the funds on deposit 
when we draw revolving loans under this facility  the loans are funded from the million on deposit with the administrative agent 
when we make repayments  the repayments are redeposited with the administrative agent 
under current accounting rules  the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility will be reflected as debt on our balance sheet only if we have outstanding thereunder revolving loans or payments by the facility in respect of letters of credit 
we will not be liable for any losses to or misappropriation of any i return due to the administrative agent s failure to achieve the return described above or to pay all or any portion of such return to any lender under such facility or ii funds on deposit in such account by such lender other than the obligation to repay funds released from such accounts and provided to us as revolving loans under such facility 
senior credit facility interest rates and fees 
borrowings under the term loan b facility and the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at our option  either i the london interbank offering rate plus a margin of basis points reduced to basis points in february  or ii a rate consisting of the greater of the jp morgan chase prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points  plus a margin of basis points reduced to basis points in february 
there is no cost to us for issuing letters of credit under the tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility  however outstanding letters of credit reduce our availability to borrow revolving loans under this portion of the facility 
if a letter of credit issued under this facility is subsequently paid and we do not reimburse the amount paid in full  then a ratable portion of each lender s deposit would be used to fund the letter of credit 
we pay the tranche b lenders a fee which is equal to libor plus basis points reduced to basis points in february 
this fee is offset by the return on the funds deposited with the administrative agent which earn interest at a per annum rate approximately equal to libor 
outstanding revolving loans reduce the funds on deposit with the administrative agent which in turn reduce the earnings of those deposits and effectively increases our interest expense at a per annum rate equal to libor 
the interest margins for borrowings under the term loan b facility and tranche b letter of credit revolving loan facility will be further reduced by basis points following the end of each fiscal quarter for which the consolidated leverage ratio is less than or at the point our credit ratings are improved to bb or better by standard poor s and are rated at least b by moody s or to ba or better by moody s and are rated at least b by standard poor s 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at our option  either i the london interbank offering rate plus a margin of basis points  or ii a rate consisting of the greater of the jp morgan chase prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points  plus a margin of basis points 
letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility accrue a letter of credit fee at a per annum rate of basis points for the pro rata account of the lenders under such facility and a fronting fee for the ratable account of the issuers thereof at a per annum rate in an amount to be agreed upon payable quarterly in arrears 
the interest margins for borrowings and letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment based on the consolidated leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness divided by consolidated ebitda as defined in the senior credit facility agreement measured at the end of each quarter 
the margin we pay on the revolving credit facility will be reduced by basis points following each fiscal quarter for which the consolidated leverage ratio is less than beginning in march we also pay a commitment fee of basis points on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
this commitment fee will be reduced by basis points following the end of each fiscal quarter for which the consolidated leverage ratio is less than senior credit facility other terms and conditions 
the amended and restated senior credit facility requires that we maintain financial ratios equal to or better than the following consolidated leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness divided by consolidated ebitda  consolidated interest coverage ratio consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated cash interest paid  and fixed charge coverage ratio consolidated ebitda less consolidated capital expenditures  divided by consolidated cash interest paid at the end of each period indicated

the senior credit facility agreement also contains restrictions on our operations that are customary for similar facilities  including limitations on i incurring additional liens  ii sale and leaseback transactions except for the permitted transactions as described in the amendment  iii liquidations and dissolutions  iv incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees  v capital expenditures  vi dividends  vii mergers and consolidations  and viii prepayments and modifications of subordinated and other debt instruments 
compliance with these requirements and restrictions is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the senior credit facility agreement and failure to meet these requirements enables the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans 
as of december   we were in compliance with all the financial covenants as indicated above and operational restrictions of the facility 
our senior credit facility does not contain any terms that could accelerate the payment of the facility as a result of a credit rating agency downgrade 
senior secured and subordinated notes 
our outstanding debt also includes million of percent senior secured notes due july   in addition to the million of percent senior subordinated notes due november  described above 
we can redeem some or all of the notes at any time after july   in the case of the senior secured notes  and november   in the case of the senior subordinated notes 
if we sell certain of our assets or experience specified kinds of changes in control  we must offer to repurchase the notes 
we are permitted to redeem up to percent of the senior secured notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before july  and up to percent of the senior subordinated notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before november  our senior secured and subordinated notes require that  as a condition precedent to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted  our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as calculated on a proforma basis  to be greater than and  respectively 
we have not incurred any of the types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted by the indentures 
the indentures also contain restrictions on our operations  including limitations on i incurring additional indebtedness or liens  ii dividends  iii distributions and stock repurchases  iv investments  v asset sales and vi mergers and consolidations 
subject to limited exceptions  all of our existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee these notes on a joint and several basis 
in addition  the senior secured notes and related guarantees are secured by second priority liens  subject to specified exceptions  on all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets that secure obligations under our senior credit facility  except that only a portion of the capital stock of our and our subsidiary guarantor s domestic subsidiaries is provided as collateral and no assets or capital stock of our direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries secure the notes or guarantees 
there are no significant restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries that have guaranteed these notes to make distributions to us 
the senior subordinated notes rank junior in right of payment to our senior credit facility and any future senior debt incurred 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions of these indentures 
accounts receivable securitization 
in addition to our senior credit facility  senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes  we also sell some of our accounts receivable 
in north america  we have an accounts receivable securitization program with a commercial bank 
we sell original equipment and aftermarket receivables on a daily basis under this program 
we sold accounts receivable under this program of million and million at december  and  respectively 
this program is subject to cancellation prior to its maturity date if we were to i fail to pay interest or principal payments on an amount of indebtedness exceeding million  ii default on the financial covenant ratios under the senior credit facility  or iii fail to maintain certain financial ratios in connection with the accounts receivable securitization program 
in january  this program was renewed for days to january  at the existing facility size of million 
we also sell some receivables in our european operations to regional banks in europe 
at december  we sold million of accounts receivable in europe down from million at december  the arrangements to sell receivables in europe are not committed and can be cancelled at any time 
if we were not able to sell receivables under either the north american or european securitization programs  our borrowings under our revolving credit agreements would increase 
these accounts receivable securitization programs provide us with access to cash at costs that are generally favorable to alternative sources of financing  and allow us to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit agreements 
capital requirements 
we believe that cash flows from operations  combined with available borrowing capacity described above  assuming that we maintain compliance with the financial covenants and other requirements of our loan agreement  will be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements for the following year 
our ability to meet the financial covenants depends upon a number of operational and economic factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that could impact our ability to comply with the financial covenants include the rate at which consumers continue to buy new vehicles and the rate at which they continue to repair vehicles already in service  as well as our ability to successfully implement our restructuring plans 
lower north american vehicle production levels  weakening in the global aftermarket  or a reduction in vehicle production levels in europe  beyond our expectations  could impact our ability to meet our financial covenant ratios 
in the event that we are unable to meet these financial covenants  we would consider several options to meet our cash flow needs 
these options could include further renegotiations with our senior credit lenders  additional cost reduction or restructuring initiatives  sales of assets or common stock  or other alternatives to enhance our financial and operating position 
should we be required to implement any of these actions to meet our cash flow needs  we believe we can do so in a reasonable time frame 
contractual obligations our remaining required debt principal amortization and payment obligations under lease and certain other financial commitments as of december   are shown in the following table payments due in beyond total millions obligations revolver borrowings senior long term debt long term notes capital leases subordinated long term debt other subsidiary debt short term debt debt and capital lease obligations   operating leases interest payments capital commitments total payments   we principally use our revolving credit facilities to finance our short term capital requirements 
as a result  we classify any outstanding balances of the revolving credit facilities within our short term debt even though the revolving credit facility has a termination date of december  and the tranche b letter of credit facility revolving loan facility has a termination date of december  the revolving credit facilities balances included in short term debt was zero at both december  and  respectively 
if we do not maintain compliance with the terms of our senior credit facility  senior secured notes indenture and senior subordinated debt indenture described above  all amounts under those arrangements could  automatically or at the option of the lenders or other debt holders  become due 
additionally  each of those facilities contains provisions that certain events of default under one facility will constitute a default under the other facility  allowing the acceleration of all amounts due 
we currently expect to maintain compliance with terms of all of our various credit agreements for the foreseeable future 
included in our contractual obligations is the amount of interest to be paid on our long term debt 
as our debt structure contains both fixed and variable rate interest debt  we have made assumptions in calculating the amount of the future interest payments 
interest on our senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes is calculated using the fixed rates of percent and percent  respectively 
interest on our variable rate debt is calculated as basis points plus libor of percent which was the rate at december  we have assumed that libor will remain unchanged for the outlying years 
see capitalization 
in addition we have included the impact of our interest rate swaps entered into in april see interest rate risk below 
in february  we made a million voluntary payment on our senior long term debt 
the impact of this payment eliminates each quarterly million payment we were required to make through and reduces by million our first quarterly payment due in we have also included an estimate of expenditures required after december  to complete the facilities and projects authorized at december   in which we have made substantial commitments in connections with facilities 
we have not included purchase obligations as part of our contractual obligations as we generally do not enter into long term agreements with our suppliers 
in addition  the agreements we currently have do not specify the volumes we are required to purchase 
if any commitment is provided  in many cases the agreements state only the minimum percentage of our purchase requirements we must buy from the supplier 
as a result  these purchase obligations fluctuate from year to year and we are not able to quantify the amount of our future obligation 
we have not included material cash requirements for taxes as we are a taxpayer in certain foreign jurisdictions but not in domestic locations 
additionally  it is difficult to estimate taxes to be paid as changes in where we generate income can have a significant impact on future tax payments 
we have also not included cash requirements for funding pension and postretirement benefit costs 
based upon current estimates we believe we will be required to make contributions between million to million to those plans in pension and postretirement contributions beyond will be required but those amounts will vary based upon many factors  including the performance of our pension fund investments during in addition  we have not included cash requirements for environmental remediation 
based upon current estimates we believe we will be required to spend approximately million over the next to years 
however  due to possible modifications in remediation processes and other factors  it is difficult to determine the actual timing of the payments 
see environmental and other matters 
we occasionally provide guarantees that could require us to make future payments in the event that the third party primary obligor does not make its required payments 
we have not recorded a liability for any of these guarantees 
the only third party guarantee we have made is the performance of lease obligations by a former affiliate 
our maximum liability under this guarantee was approximately million at both december  and  respectively 
we have no recourse in the event of default by the former affiliate 
however  we have not been required to make any payments under this guarantee 
additionally  we have from time to time issued guarantees for the performance of obligations by some of our subsidiaries  and some of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our debt 
all of our then existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee our senior credit facility  our senior secured notes and our senior subordinated notes on a joint and several basis 
the arrangement for the senior credit facility is also secured by first priority liens on substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of percent of the stock of certain first tier foreign subsidiaries 
the arrangement for the million senior secured notes is also secured by second priority liens on substantially all our domestic assets  excluding some of the stock of our domestic subsidiaries 
no assets or capital stock of our direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries secure these notes 
you should also read note where we present the supplemental guarantor condensed consolidating financial statements 
we have issued guarantees through letters of credit in connection with some obligations of our affiliates 
we have guaranteed through letters of credit support for local credit facilities  travel and procurement card programs  and cash management requirements for some of our subsidiaries totaling million 
we have also issued million in letters of credit to support some of our subsidiaries insurance arrangements 
in addition  we have issued million in guarantees through letters of credit to guarantee other obligations of subsidiaries primarily related to environmental remediation activities 
dividends on common stock on january   we announced that our board of directors eliminated the quarterly dividend on our common stock 
the board took the action in response to industry conditions  primarily greater than anticipated production volume reductions by original equipment manufacturers and continued softness in the global light vehicle aftermarket 
there are no current plans to reinstate a dividend on our common stock 
cash flows years ended december  millions cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities for the year ended december   cash flow provided from operating activities was million as compared to million in the prior year 
for cash flow provided from working capital was million as compared to million for higher sales levels in are the primary driver for higher year over year receivables balances 
in addition  benefited from actions to rationalize our aftermarket product offering  which generated million in cash flow from reduced inventory levels 
cash interest payments in were also significantly higher as a result of the refinancing transactions 
this was partially offset by lower cash tax payments 
in june  we entered into arrangements with two major oe customers in north america under which  in exchange for a discount  payments for product sales are made earlier than otherwise required under existing payment terms 
these arrangements reduced accounts receivable by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we have been informed that the financing company that supports this program intends to discontinue advance payments on behalf of the oe customers by the end of with a small portion of the program ending in the first quarter of although we cannot assure you that another similar arrangement will be available for periods after december on commercially reasonable terms  we intend to seek such an arrangement 
in june  we entered into a similar arrangement with a third major oe customer in north america 
this arrangement reduced accounts receivable by million as of december  we have been informed that this program will be discontinued after december  in march  we entered into another arrangement with a major oe customer in europe 
this arrangement reduced accounts receivable by million at december  this arrangement can be cancelled at any time 
one of our european subsidiaries receives payment from one of its oe customers whereby the account receivables are satisfied through the delivery of negotiable financial instruments 
these financial instruments are then sold at a discount to a european bank 
the sales of these financial instruments are not included in the account receivables sold in any of these financial instruments which were not sold as of december  and are classified as other current assets and are excluded from our definition of cash equivalents 
we had sold approximately million of these instruments at december  investing activities cash used for investing activities was million lower in compared to the same period a year ago 
in we received million in cash from the sale of a portion of our birmingham  uk facility 
capital expenditures were million in both and financing activities cash flow from financing activities was a million outflow in compared to an outflow of million in the same period of the primary reason for the change is attributable to the million bond offering in june  the million bond offering in december  the senior debt refinancing in december of and the subordinated debt refinancing in november of outlook north american oe light vehicle production levels for were million units  down one percent from current estimates for indicate that north american oe light vehicle production levels will be equal to at million units 
however  we remain cautious about the outlook for north american production rates due to rising interest rates  oil and steel prices and current original equipment manufacturers inventory levels 
we are also uncertain about the willingness of the original equipment manufacturers to continue to support consumer vehicle sales through incentives 
we believe that new product launches and our position on top selling platforms  along with increasing market positions with toyota  honda and nissan  will help us to offset pressures from north american production rates 
western europe light vehicle production volumes grew about one percent during to million units 
expectations for indicate production will remain flat at levels 
we saw a strong increase in heavy duty truck production rates during compared to  heavy duty truck production rates increased percent in  and are expected to increase another to percent in although heavy duty business represents a small percentage of our overall revenues  this should benefit our north american operations 
in the global aftermarket  issues that have impacted revenues in the past will likely continue to be a challenge in heightened competition in the european aftermarket and longer product replacement cycles are expected to continue their impact on volumes 
we saw signs of sales stabilization in the north america aftermarket exhaust business unit during  and we are cautiously optimistic that these conditions will continue in we also plan to continue our efforts to increase new and existing sales in the north american aftermarket ride control business unit 
based on anticipated vehicle production levels our global original equipment customer book of business is expected to be million higher than our oe revenues  or about billion in  and is expected to increase an additional million to about billion in adjusted for pass through sales  our global original equipment customer book of business is expected to be billion and billion for and  respectively  or reflects an expected increase of about million in and million in over our oe revenues adjusted for pass through sales 
when we refer to our book of business  we mean revenues for original equipment manufacturer programs that have been formally awarded to us as well as programs which we are highly confident will result in revenues based on either informal customer indications consistent with past practices and or our status as supplier for the existing program and relationship with the customer 
this book of business is subject to increase or decrease due to changes in customer requirements  customer and consumer preferences  and the number of vehicles actually produced by our customers 
we do not intend  however  to update the amounts shown above due to these changes 
in addition  our book of business is based on our anticipated pricing for each applicable program over its life 
however  we are under continuing pricing pressures from our oe customers 
we do not intend to update the amounts shown above for any price changes 
finally  for our foreign operations the book of business assumes a fixed foreign currency value 
this value is used to translate foreign business to the us dollar 
currency in our foreign operations is subject to fluctuation based on the economic conditions in each of our foreign operations 
we do not intend to update the amounts shown above due to these fluctuations 
see cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of we are actively addressing higher steel costs  expected to continue through we anticipate that steel cost increases  net of other expected material cost savings and recovery from customers  will be between million and million for we are intensely focused on mitigating the impact of higher costs by implementing a restructuring initiative announced in the fourth quarter  which is expected to generate million in annual savings  improving manufacturing efficiency with lean  generating at least million in six sigma savings  and capitalizing on the projected million increase in the oe book of business 
lower interest expense as a result of our company s debt refinancing in the fourth quarter of and amendments to our senior credit facility in the first quarter of will also help mitigate the impact 
environmental and other matters we are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate 
we expense or capitalize  as appropriate  expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to current operations 
we expense expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
we record liabilities when environmental assessments indicate that remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the liability are based upon currently available facts  existing technology  and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors 
we consider all available evidence including prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites  other companies cleanup experiences and data released by the united states environmental protection agency or other organizations 
these estimated liabilities are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information 
where future cash flows are fixed or reliably determinable  we have discounted the liabilities 
all other environmental liabilities are recorded at their undiscounted amounts 
we evaluate recoveries separately from the liability and  when they are assured  recoveries are recorded and reported separately from the associated liability in our financial statements 
as of december   we are designated as a potentially responsible party in one superfund site 
we have estimated our share of the remediation costs for this site to be less than million in the aggregate 
in addition to the superfund site  we may have the obligation to remediate current or former facilities  and we estimate our share of remediation costs at these facilities to be approximately million 
for the superfund site and the current and former facilities  we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for these costs 
although we believe our estimates of remediation costs are reasonable and are based on the latest available information  the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required 
at some sites  we expect that other parties will contribute to the remediation costs 
in addition  at the superfund site  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act provides that our liability could be joint and several  meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our share of remediation costs 
our understanding of the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at the superfund site  and of other liable parties at our current and former facilities  has been considered  where appropriate  in our determination of our estimated liability 
we believe that any potential costs associated with our current status as a potentially responsible party in the superfund site  or as a liable party at our current or former facilities  will not be material to our results of operations or consolidated financial position 
from time to time we are subject to product warranty claims whereby we are required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products 
warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included under item for information regarding our warranty reserves 
we also from time to time are involved in legal proceedings  claims or investigations that are incidental to the conduct of our business 
some of these proceedings allege damages against us relating to environmental liabilities including toxic tort  property damage and remediation  intellectual property matters including patent  trademark and copyright infringement  and licensing disputes  personal injury claims including injuries due to product failure  design or warnings issues  and other product liability related matters  taxes  employment matters  and commercial or contractual disputes  sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures 
as an example  we are involved in litigation with the minority owner of one of our indian joint ventures over various operational issues that involves a court mandate bidding process 
we vigorously defend ourselves against all of these claims 
in future periods  we could be subjected to cash costs or non cash charges to earnings if any of these matters is resolved on unfavorable terms 
however  although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty  based on present information  including our assessment of the merits of the particular claim  we do not expect that these legal proceedings or claims will have any material adverse impact on our future consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition  we are subject to a number of lawsuits initiated by a significant number of claimants alleging health problems as a result of exposure to asbestos 
many of these cases involve significant numbers of individual claimants 
however  only a small percentage of these claimants allege that they were automobile mechanics who were allegedly exposed to our former muffler products and a significant number appear to involve workers in other industries or otherwise do not include sufficient information to determine whether there is any basis for a claim against us 
we believe  based on scientific and other evidence  it is unlikely that mechanics were exposed to asbestos by our former muffler products and that  in any event  they would not be at increased risk of asbestos related disease based on their work with these products 
further  many of these cases involve numerous defendants  with the number of each in some cases exceeding defendants from a variety of industries 
additionally  the plaintiffs either do not specify any  or specify the jurisdictional minimum  dollar amount for damages 
as major asbestos manufacturers continue to go out of business  we may experience an increased number of these claims 
we vigorously defend ourselves against these claims as part of our ordinary course of business 
in future periods  we could be subject to cash costs or non cash charges to earnings if any of these matters is resolved unfavorably to us 
to date  with respect to claims that have proceeded sufficiently through the judicial process  we have regularly achieved favorable resolution in the form of a dismissal of the claim or a judgment in our favor 
accordingly  we presently believe that these asbestos related claims will not have a material adverse impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
employee stock ownership plans we have established employee stock ownership plans for the benefit of our employees 
under the plans  participants may elect to defer up to percent of their salary through contributions to the plan  which are invested in selected mutual funds or used to buy our common stock 
we currently match in cash percent of each employee s contribution up to percent of the employee s salary 
we recorded expense for these matching contributions of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and all contributions vest immediately 
derivative financial instruments foreign currency exchange rate risk we use derivative financial instruments  principally foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year  to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary exposure to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans made between affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties 
additionally  we enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany and third party trade receivables and payables 
we manage counter party credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with major financial institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements 
we have from time to time also entered into forward contracts to hedge our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
in managing our foreign currency exposures  we identify and aggregate existing offsetting positions and then hedge residual exposures through third party derivative contracts 
the following table summarizes by major currency the notional amounts  weighted average settlement rates  and fair value for foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts as of december  all contracts in the following table mature in december  notional amount weighted average fair value in in foreign currency settlement rates us dollars millions except settlement rates australian dollars purchase

interest rate risk our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk for changes in interest rates are our debt securities 
we primarily use our revolving credit facilities to finance our short term capital requirements 
we pay a current market rate of interest on these borrowings 
we have financed our long term capital requirements with long term debt with original maturity dates ranging from six to ten years 
in april  we entered into three separate fixed to floating interest rate swaps with two separate financial institutions 
these agreements swapped an aggregate of million of fixed interest rate debt at a per annum rate of percent to floating interest rate debt at a per annum rate of libor plus a spread of percent 
each agreement requires semi annual settlements through july  the libor in effect for these swaps during the course of resulted in lower interest expense of approximately million for the year 
the libor rate as of december  as determined under these agreements is percent 
this rate remained in effect until january  when it increased to percent 
based on the january  libor rate of percent which remains in effect until july   these swaps would reduce our annual interest expense by approximately million 
these swaps qualify as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and as such are recorded on the balance sheet at market value with an offset to the underlying hedged item  which is long term debt 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately million  which has been recorded as a decrease to long term debt and an increase to other long term liabilities 
on december   we had million in long term debt obligations that have fixed interest rates 
of that amount  million is fixed through july and million through november  while the remainder is fixed over periods of through there is also million in long term debt obligations that have variable interest rates based on a current market rate of interest 
we estimate that the fair value of our long term debt at december  was about percent of its book value 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize in the income statement and the cash we pay for interest expense by about million after tax  excluding the effect of the interest rate swaps we completed in april a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates on the swaps we completed in april would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize in the income statement and the cash we pay for interest expense by approximately million after tax
