overview we are a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative therapies in the fields of ophthalmology  dermatology  oncology and urology 
our company was formed in under the laws of the province of british columbia  canada 
our first commercial product was in the field of photodynamic therapy  or pdt  which uses photosensitizers light activated drugs in the treatment of disease 
our most significant commercial product  visudyne r  utilizes pdt to treat the eye disease known as wet form age related macular degeneration  or wet amd  the leading cause of blindness in people over in north american and europe 
visudyne is commercially available in more than countries  including the us  canada  japan and the european union countries  for the treatment of a form of wet amd known as predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization  or cnv  and in over countries for the form of wet amd known as occult subfoveal cnv 
visudyne is reimbursed in the us by the centers for medicare medicaid services for certain patients with the occult and minimally classic forms of wet amd 
it is also approved in more than countries  including the us  canada and the european union countries  for the treatment of subfoveal cnv due to pathologic myopia severe near sightedness 
in some countries including the us and canada visudyne is also approved for presumed ocular histoplasmosis or other macular diseases 
qlt developed and commercializes visudyne through a contractual alliance with novartis ophthalmics a division of novartis pharma ag 
in november  we acquired atrix laboratories  inc  a fort collins  colorado based biopharmaceutical company focused on advanced drug delivery  for which we paid aggregate consideration of million  in cash and equity 
with our acquisition of atrix now our wholly owned subsidiary qlt usa  inc we have expanded and diversified our portfolio of approved products  products in development or under regulatory review  and proprietary technologies 
in addition to our lead commercial product visudyne  as a result of the atrix acquisition  we now market  through commercial partners  the eligard r group of products for the treatment of prostate cancer  a line of dermatology products and a line of dental products 
the eligard product line includes four different commercial formulations of our atrigel r technology combined with leuprolide acetate for the treatment of prostate cancer 
the us food and drug administration  or fda  has approved all four products eligard mg one month  eligard mg three month  eligard mg four month and eligard mg six month 
the eligard mg and eligard mg products are also approved in a number of other countries  including most european countries  canada  australia and a number of latin american countries 
our newly acquired portfolio of dermatology products consists of both proprietary and generic products that are commercialized  under regulatory review  or in various stages of development 
our lead proprietary dermatology product  aczone tm  is currently undergoing regulatory review  a new drug application  or nda  was filed with the fda for aczone in the third quarter of our generic dermatology business  which is part of a joint venture with sandoz  inc  currently comprises five marketed products and five under regulatory review 
our efforts to increase our portfolio of marketed products are ongoing 
we have a number of product candidates in our development pipeline in addition to aczone including another photosensitizer  lemuteporfin which we used to call qlt  currently being studied in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia  or bph  the most common prostatic disease 
we carry out research and pre clinical projects  in fields such as ophthalmology  dermatology  and oncology 
we also carry out contract research and development work on product candidates of third parties from which we can potentially derive royalty revenue upon commercialization 
acquisition of atrix laboratories  inc 
on november   we completed our acquisition of atrix laboratories  inc  or atrix  a biopharmaceutical company focused on advanced drug delivery 
upon completion of the acquisition  each outstanding share of atrix common stock was converted into the right to receive one qlt inc common share and in cash 
in addition  each option to purchase atrix common stock that was outstanding at the closing of the acquisition was assumed by qlt in accordance with the agreement and plan of merger dated june  among qlt and atrix 
the results of operations of atrix are included in the consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date  and the related assets and liabilities were recorded based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
we paid aggregate consideration of million million in cash  million in common shares  million in other equity  and million in acquisition related expenditures for the atrix business 
we allocated the total consideration for atrix  including acquisition costs  based on our preliminary assessment as to the estimated fair values on the acquisition date 
our preliminary assessment is subject to change upon the final determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make certain estimates  judgements and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
significant estimates are used for  but not limited to  provisions for non completion of inventory  assessment of the net realizable value of long lived assets  accruals for contract manufacturing and research and development agreements  allocation of costs to manufacturing under a standard costing system  allocation of overhead expenses to research and development  determination of fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in the purchase business combinations  and provisions for taxes and contingencies 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include those which follow reporting currency and foreign currency translation we use the us dollar as our reporting currency  while the canadian dollar is the functional currency for the parent company and the us dollar is the functional currency for the us subsidiary 
our consolidated financial statements are translated into us dollars using the current rate method 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date 
shareholders equity is translated at the applicable historical rates 
revenues and expenses are translated at a weighted average rate of exchange for the respective years 
translation gains and losses are included as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment  which is reported as a component of shareholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as of december   our accumulated other comprehensive income totalled million 
revenue recognition net product revenue our net product revenues are primarily derived from sales of visudyne and eligard 
with respect to visudyne  under the terms of our collaborative agreement with novartis ophthalmics we are responsible for visudyne manufacturing and product supply and novartis ophthalmics is responsible for marketing and distribution of visudyne 
our agreement with novartis ophthalmics provides that the calculation of total revenue for the sale of visudyne be composed of three components an advance on the cost of inventory sold to novartis ophthalmics  an amount equal to of the profit that novartis ophthalmics derives from the sale of visudyne to end users  and the reimbursement of other specified costs incurred and paid for by us see note net product revenues 
we recognize revenue from the sale of visudyne when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery to novartis ophthalmics has occurred  the end selling price of visudyne is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
under the calculation of revenue noted above  this occurs upon sell through of visudyne to the end customers 
our revenue from visudyne will fluctuate dependent upon novartis ophthalmics ability to market and distribute the visudyne to end customers 
with respect to eligard  under the terms of our collaborative agreements with our marketing partners  we are responsible for the manufacture of eligard and receive from our marketing partners an agreed upon sales price upon shipment to them 
we also earn royalties from certain marketing partners based upon their sales of eligard products to end customers which royalties are included in net royalty revenue 
we recognize net revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product is shipped and title is transferred to our marketing partners  collectibility is reasonably assured and the price is fixed or determinable 
our net product revenue from eligard will fluctuate dependent upon our ability to deliver eligard products to our marketing partners 
our eligard marketing partners are responsible for all products after shipment from our facility 
we do not offer rebates or discounts and have not experienced any material product returns  accordingly  we do not provide an allowance for rebates  discounts  and returns 
net royalties we recognize net royalties when product is shipped by certain of our marketing partners to end customers based on royalty rates and formulas specified in our agreements with them 
generally  royalties are based on estimated net product sales gross sales less discounts  allowances and other items based on information supplied to us by our marketing partners 
contract research and development contract research and development revenues consist of non refundable research and development funding under collaborative agreements with our various strategic partners 
contract research and development funding generally compensates us for discovery  preclinical and clinical expenses related to collaborative development programs for certain products and product candidates  and is recognized as revenue at the time research and development activities are performed under the terms of the collaborative agreements 
for fixed price contracts we recognize contract research and development revenue over the term of the agreement  which is consistent with the pattern of work performed 
amounts received under the collaborative agreements are non refundable even if the research and development efforts performed by us do not eventually result in a commercial product 
contract research and development revenues earned in excess of payments received are classified as contract research and development receivables and payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
see note accounts receivable and note contract research and development 
cost of sales visudyne cost of sales  consisting of expenses related to the production of bulk visudyne and royalty expense on visudyne sales  are charged against earnings in the period that novartis ophthalmics sells to third parties 
cost of sales related to the production of various eligard  generic dermatology  and atridox products are charged against earnings in the period of the related product sale to our marketing partners 
we utilize a standard costing system  which includes a reasonable allocation of overhead expenses  to account for inventory and cost of sales  with adjustments being made periodically to reflect current conditions 
our standard costs are estimated based on management s best estimate of annual production volumes and material costs 
overhead expenses comprise direct and indirect support activities related to the manufacture of bulk visudyne  various eligard  generic dermatology  and atridox products and involve costs associated with activities such as quality inspection  quality assurance  supply chain management  safety and regulatory 
overhead expenses are allocated to inventory during each stage of the manufacturing process under a standard costing system  and eventually to cost of sales as the related products are sold to our marketing partners or in the case of visudyne  by novartis ophthalmics to third parties 
while we believe our standard costs are reliable  actual production costs and volume changes may impact inventory  cost of sales  and the absorption of production overheads 
for visudyne  we record a provision for the non completion of product inventory based on our history of batch completion to provide for the potential failure of inventory batches to pass quality inspection 
the provision is calculated at each stage of the manufacturing process 
we estimate our non completion rate based on past production and adjust our provision quarterly based on actual production volume 
a batch failure may utilize a significant portion of the provision as a single completed batch currently costs between million and million  depending on the stage of production 
we provide a reserve for obsolescence of our eligard inventory and component materials based on our periodic evaluation of potential obsolete inventory 
stock based compensation as allowed by the provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  we apply accounting principles board  opinion no 
 or apb  and related interpretations in the accounting for employee stock option plans 
sfas requires that all stock based awards made to non employees be measured and recognized using a fair value based method 
the standard encourages the use of a fair value based method for all awards granted to employees  but only requires the use of a fair value based method for direct awards of stock  stock appreciation rights  and awards that call for settlement in cash or other assets 
estimates of fair value are determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of this model requires certain assumptions regarding the volatility  term  and risk free interest rate experienced by the holder 
awards that a company has the ability to settle in stock are recorded as equity  whereas awards that the entity is required to or has a practice of settling in cash are recorded as liabilities 
we have adopted the disclosure only provision for stock based compensation for stock options granted to employees and directors  consistent with sfas if we had adopted a fair value based method for stock based compensation under sfas  the impact on our net loss income and net loss income per common share would have been as described in note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
the statement eliminates the alternative to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires such transactions be recognized as compensation expense in the statement of earnings based on their fair values on the date of the grant  with the compensation expense recognized over the period in which a grantee is required to provide service in exchange for the stock award 
we will adopt this statement on july  using a modified prospective application as defined in sfas r 
as such  the compensation expense recognition provisions will apply to new awards and to any awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the adoption date 
additionally  for any unvested awards outstanding at the adoption date  we will recognize compensation expense over the remaining vesting period 
research and development research and development costs consist of direct and indirect expenditures  including a reasonable allocation of overhead expenses  associated with our various research and development programs 
overhead expenses comprise general and administrative support provided to the research and development programs and involve costs associated with support activities such as facility maintenance  utilities  office services  information technology  legal  accounting and human resources 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
costs related to the acquisition of development rights for which no alternative use exists are classified as research and development and expensed as incurred 
patent application  filing and defense costs are also expensed as incurred 
income taxes income taxes are reported using the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards using applicable enacted tax rates 
an increase or decrease in these tax rates will increase or decrease the carrying value of future net tax assets resulting in an increase or decrease to net income 
income tax credits are included as part of the provision for income taxes 
the realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of any loss carry forward balance 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset may not be realized 
legal proceedings we are involved in a number of legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in these legal actions  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  would require significant expenditures 
we record a liability in the consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated  a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
our potentially material legal proceedings are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   no reserve has been established related to these proceedings 
long lived and intangible assets occasionally we incur costs to purchase and construct property  plant and equipment 
the treatment of costs to purchase or construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction 
costs incurred in the initial design and evaluation phase  such as the cost of performing feasibility studies and evaluating alternatives are charged to expense 
costs incurred in the committed project planning and design phase  and in the construction and installation phase  are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset 
we stop capitalizing costs when an asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
since  we have been depreciating plant and equipment using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from years 
determining the economic lives of plant and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
in accounting for acquisitions  we allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets  including in process research and development  or ipr d 
we generally estimate the value of acquired intangible assets and ipr d using a discounted cash flow model  which requires us to make assumptions and estimates about  among other things the time and investment that is required to develop products and technologies  our ability to develop and commercialize products before our competitors develop and commercialize products for the same indications  the amount of revenue to be derived from the products  and appropriate discount rates to use in the analysis 
use of different estimates and judgments could yield materially different results in our analysis  and could result in materially different asset values and ipr d charges 
as of december   there were approximately million of goodwill and approximately million of net acquired intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet 
we amortize acquired intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from to years 
determining the economic lives of acquired intangible assets requires us to make significant judgments and estimates and can materially impact our operating results 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangibles  we are required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates were made at the time of acquisition of atrix specifically regarding product development  market conditions and cash flows that were used to determine the valuation of goodwill and intangibles 
when we perform impairment tests in future years  the possibility exists that changes in forecasts and estimates from those used at the acquisition date could result in impairment charges 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
issue no 
addresses the issue of when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share 
previously  the potential dilutive effect of the conversion feature was excluded from diluted earnings per share until the contingent feature was met 
issue no 
results in contingently convertible debt instruments being included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether the contingent features are met 
the provisions of issue no 
apply to reporting periods ending after december  the adoption of issue no 
has resulted in our diluted earnings per share calculation including the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt 
prior period diluted earnings per share amounts presented for comparative purposes have been restated to conform to this method 
in november  fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage be treated as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities during periods of below normal production 
our consolidated financial statements comply with the requirements of sfas no 
in december  fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
this statement eliminates the alternative to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires such transactions be recognized as compensation expense in the statement of earnings based on their fair values on the date of the grant  with the compensation expense recognized over the period in which a grantee is required to provide service in exchange for the stock award 
we will adopt this statement on july  using a modified prospective application 
as such  the compensation expense recognition provisions will apply to new awards and to any awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the adoption date 
additionally  for any unvested awards outstanding at the adoption date  we will recognize compensation expense over the remaining vesting period 
we have begun  but have not yet completed  evaluating the impact of adopting sfas r on our results of operations 
we currently determine the fair value of stock based compensation using a black scholes option pricing model for pro forma purposes 
in connection with evaluating the impact of adopting sfas r  we are also considering the potential implementation of different valuation models to determine the fair value of stock based compensation  although no decision has yet been made 
however  we believe the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations  regardless of the valuation technique used 
comparison of years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million  or per common share 
these results compare with net income of million  or per common share  for the year ended december  during  we recorded a million charge for in process research and development when we completed our acquisition of atrix laboratories  inc also during  we completed our acquisition of kinetek pharmaceuticals  inc  which resulted in an extraordinary gain of million  primarily due to the recognition of certain tax assets 
excluding the charge for in process research and development and the extraordinary gain  net income would have been million 
revenues net product revenue net product revenue was determined as follows for the year for the year ended ended december  december  in thousands of us dollars visudyne r sales by novartis ophthalmics   less marketing and distribution costs   less inventory costs   less royalties   qlt share of remaining revenue on final sales   add inventory costs reimbursed to qlt   add royalties reimbursed to qlt   add other costs reimbursed to qlt   revenue from visudyne r sales   net product revenue from eligard r and other products from november to december   the revenue from visudyne sales of million increased by million or over the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a increase in visudyne sales  which resulted from i continued market growth in europe  ii receipt of reimbursement for certain occult and minimally classic lesions in the us  and iii favorable foreign exchange rates  particularly the strengthening of the euro relative to the us dollar contributing six percentage points of the increase in visudyne sales 
in  approximately of total visudyne sales by novartis ophthalmics were in the us  compared to approximately in overall  the ratio of our share of revenue on final sales compared to visudyne sales was in  up from in the prior year 
marketing and distribution costs rose to million for the year  compared to million in  due primarily to increases in advertising and promotion and sales force expenses 
as a result of our acquisition of atrix  our net product revenue included million from eligard and other atrix products since november  net royalties as a result of our acquisition of atrix  we have included million of net royalties related to eligard and other atrix products since november  contract research and development revenue we receive non refundable research and development funding from novartis ophthalmics and other strategic partners  which is recorded as contract research and development revenue 
for the year ended december   contract research and development revenue decreased by to million 
the decrease was due to the elimination of the multiple basal cell carcinoma program and the cessation of reimbursement from xenova limited for tariquidar development 
this was partially offset by an increase in contract research and development programs resulting from our acquisition of atrix 
costs and expenses cost of sales for the year ended december   cost of sales was million  up compared to million for the year ended december  cost of sales related to revenue from visudyne increased to million in  from million in  due primarily to the increase in visudyne sales in the year 
cost of sales in also included million related to revenue from eligard and other products acquired in our acquisition of atrix 
of this amount  million was related to the fair value adjustment to atrix s inventory at the time of the acquisition 
research and development research and development  or r d  expenditures increased million or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher spending on integrin linked kinase  or ilk  research  increased development work on lemuteporfin  the addition of r d expenses related to atrix projects post acquisition  and negative foreign exchange effects primarily the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar 
combined  these increases more than offset the decrease in spending related to the development of tariquidar  which was halted during selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses of million were up compared to million for the year ended december  the increase primarily related to the addition of sg a expenses from the atrix business post acquisition  higher compensation costs  expenses associated with our sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts and negative foreign exchange effects primarily the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar 
combined  these increases were only partially offset by higher inventory absorption of production overheads and decreased funding for endowments 
sg a expenses include certain overhead expenses associated with the manufacture of products 
depreciation expense depreciation expense relates to the depreciation of property  plant  and equipment 
for the year ended december   depreciation expense of million increased compared to million for the year ended december  amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles of million related to the developed technology and trademark intangibles acquired in our acquisition of atrix on november  the estimated fair value of the trademark relates to the eligard trademark and the estimated fair value of developed technology relates to existing fda approved products certain eligard  dermatology and dental products 
developed technology and trademark intangibles are being amortized over their expected useful lives of to years  respectively 
in process research and development in  we incurred an in process research and development  or ipr d  charge of million 
there were no ipr d charges in or the amount expensed to ipr d in arose from our acquisition of atrix 
we calculated the charge for ipr d related to atrix by determining the fair value of the existing products as well as the technology that was currently under development  using the income approach 
under the income approach  expected future after tax cash flows from each of the projects under development are estimated and discounted to their net present value at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
revenues were estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles  and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and charges for the use of contributory assets were deducted from estimated revenues to determine estimated after tax cash flows for each project 
these projected future cash flows were further adjusted for additional risks inherent in the development life cycle  the value contributed by any core technology  and development efforts expected to be completed post acquisition 
these forecasted cash flows were then discounted based on rates derived from our weighted average cost of capital  weighted average return on assets and the internal rates of return for the transaction 
as the cash flows for each project had been adjusted to account for the risk associated with each product s relative stage of development  including the characteristics and applications of our products  the inherent uncertainties in achieving technological feasibility  anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets  we determined a discount rate of 
when we acquired atrix  we did not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reduction or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions did not include anticipated cost savings 
a description of the ipr d projects acquired are as follows eligard r certain proprietary products for prostate cancer formulations incorporating a leutinizing hormone releasing hormone with one of our drug delivery systems 
the atrigel r drug delivery technology allows for sustained delivery of leuprolide acetate for periods ranging from one month to six months 
aczone tm a proprietary product for the treatment of acne  rosacea  atopic dermatitis and additional indications 
aczone tm incorporates dapsone  an anti inflammatory and antimicrobial drug with one of our drug delivery systems 
octreotide a proprietary product for long term treatment of symptoms associated with carcinoid tumors combined with one of our drug delivery systems 
cp  a pfizer compound formulated with our atrigel r technology for bone growth 
generic dermatology various generic dermatology products at various stages of clinical trial 
all of the above ipr d projects  at the date of the acquisition of atrix  were at various stages of clinical development and  with the exception of eligard month  still required substantial costs to complete 
prior to commercialization  fda and other regulatory approvals are still required 
current estimates of time and investment required to develop these products may change and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop and commercialize products before our competitors develop and commercialize products for the same indications 
if products based on our acquired ipr d programs do not become commercially viable  our results of operations could be materially affected 
investment and other income net foreign exchange gains losses net foreign exchange gains comprise gains from the impact of foreign exchange fluctuation on our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  derivative financial instruments  foreign currency receivables  foreign currency payables and us dollar denominated long term debt 
for the year ended december   we recorded net foreign exchange gains of million versus net foreign exchange gains of million in the gains in the year ended december  were from gains on us dollar long term debt and foreign exchange contracts offset by losses on cash and foreign currency receivables and payables 
see liquidity and capital resources interest and foreign exchange rates 
details of our net foreign exchange gains losses were as follows for the year ended for the year ended december  december  in thousands of us dollars cash and cash equivalents and short term investments   us dollar long term debt   foreign exchange contracts  foreign currency receivables and payables   net foreign exchange gains losses  interest income for the year ended december   interest income increased to million compared to million for the same period in this increase was a result of higher cash reserves prior to the acquisition of atrix offset by lower yield on short term investments and a lower cash balance as a result of payments related to the acquisition of atrix in november 
our treasury policy is focused on minimizing risk of loss of principal 
interest expense interest expense comprised interest accrued on the convertible senior notes issued on august  and amortization of deferred financing expenses related to this placement 
for the year ended december  interest expense increased to million from million in as a result of the convertible senior notes being outstanding for the full year 
other gains in september  we received payment from axcan pharma  inc of cad million us million for a milestone payment resulting from the approval in europe of photofrin r for barrett s esophagus 
during the same period in  we received the same amount of cad million usd million from axcan pharma  inc for approval in the us of photofrin for barrett s esophagus 
extraordinary gain on march   we acquired all the outstanding shares of kinetek pharmaceuticals  inc  or kinetek  a privately held biopharmaceutical company based in vancouver  british columbia  which focused on discovery and development of new therapies 
during the fourth quarter of  we realized certain previously unrecognized tax assets and recorded an additional extraordinary gain of million  bringing the total extraordinary gain from this transaction to million 
this extraordinary gain is the result of the acquired net assets  including certain tax assets  having a fair value in excess of the total consideration paid 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to a provision of million in the effective tax rate for negative was impacted by the acquisition of atrix and therefore is not a meaningful measure 
the effective tax rate reported in was 
adjusting for the purchase price accounting and increase in valuation allowance associated with the atrix acquisition in and the diomed holdings  inc  or diomed  write down in  the rates would have been in compared to in the net decrease resulted from a reduction in the canadian statutory tax rate and was partially offset by revisions to prior year estimates that ran through the current year provision 
the net deferred tax asset of million was largely the result of research and development credits as well as other temporary differences 
the net deferred tax liability of million was primarily a result of purchase price accounting for tangible and intangible depreciable assets in connection with the acquisition of atrix in as of december   we had a valuation allowance against specifically identified tax assets 
the valuation allowance is reviewed periodically and if management s assessment of the more likely than not criterion for accounting purposes changes  the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of years ended december  and for the year ended december  we recorded net income of million  or basic and diluted net income per common share of and  respectively 
these results compare with net income of million  or per common share for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a write down of million related to the impairment of our equity investment in kinetek  and a restructuring charge of million related to a reduction in the work force 
these two charges negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately 
revenues revenue from visudyne r our revenue from visudyne was determined as follows for the year for the year ended ended december  december  in thousands of us dollars visudyne r sales by novartis ophthalmics   less marketing and distribution costs   less inventory costs   less royalties   qlt share of remaining revenue on final sales   add inventory costs reimbursed to qlt   add royalties reimbursed to qlt   add other costs reimbursed to qlt   revenue from visudyne r as reported by qlt   for the year ended december   approximately of total visudyne sales by novartis ophthalmics were in the us  compared to approximately in for the year ended december   revenue from visudyne increased by over the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in visudyne sales  which resulted primarily from higher market penetration in markets outside the us and favorable exchange rates 
sales outside the us are primarily denominated in euros  and the strengthening of the euro relative to our us dollar reporting currency contributed to approximately of the growth in sales 
marketing and distribution costs were up million over  as reductions in advertising and promotion were more than offset by increases in charges for sales force and other expenses 
contract research and development revenue we receive non refundable research and development funding from novartis ophthalmics and other strategic partners which is recorded as contract research and development revenue 
for the year ended december  contract research and development revenue decreased to million 
the decrease was due primarily to our reacquisition of development rights to the multiple basal cell carcinoma  or mbcc  program from novartis ophthalmics during the year  after which novartis ophthalmics was no longer required to contribute to the funding of this program 
costs and expenses cost of sales for the year ended december   cost of sales increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in visudyne sales in and a million reduction in the provision related to non completion of product inventory in during the fourth quarter of  we experienced non completion of product inventory at two of our contract manufacturers 
the impact of this non completion of product inventory was partly offset by the provision for non completion of product inventory and reimbursement from one of the contract manufacturers 
the resulting impact to cost of sales was million 
our revenue from visudyne contained reimbursement by our alliance partner  novartis ophthalmics  related to inventory costs which serve to further reduce the impact of the non completion of product inventory on our net income to nil 
research and development r d expenditures increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the foreign exchange impact of the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar million  and increased spending on clinical trials related to lemuteporfin formerly qlt million and visudyne in minimally classic amd million 
partially offsetting these increases were savings from lower tariquidar development costs million and less spending on research projects million 
during the second quarter of we halted our phase iii tariquidar trials and during the fourth quarter of we halted our phase iii mbcc trials 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   sg a expenses increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  excluding a million negative foreign exchange impact  sg a expenses would have been approximately flat year over year 
increases due to an endowment to the wilmer eye institute at johns hopkins university in baltimore million and higher directors and officers liability insurance premiums million were somewhat offset by higher inventory absorption of production overheads million and lower consulting fees million 
sg a expenses include certain overhead expenses associated with the manufacture of products 
depreciation expense depreciation expense relates mainly to the depreciation of property and equipment 
for the year ended december   depreciation expense of million was flat in comparison to the year ended december  restructuring in the fourth quarter of we restructured our operations to reduce operating expenses and concentrate our resources on key product development programs and business initiatives 
we reduced our overall headcount by people or 
we provided affected employees with severance and support to assist with outplacement 
as a result  we recorded a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of related to severance and termination costs 
during the second quarter of  we reassessed our restructuring reserve based on expected remaining cash outlays for severance  termination benefits and other related costs  and accordingly reduced the reserve by million 
as of december   we had substantially completed all activities associated with the restructuring 
we estimate that the restructuring resulted in annual savings of million

the increase in our cash reserves was the result of proceeds from the convertible senior notes  which added million to interest income 
foreign exchange gains  due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  also contributed million to this increase 
our treasury policy is focused on minimizing risk of loss of principal

write down of investment during the fourth quarter of our investment in diomed  a public company  was significantly diluted as a result of an equity financing by the investee  resulting in an other than temporary impairment of million 
during the fourth quarter of  due to kinetek s reduced cash position and exhaustion of various strategic alternatives  we contracted an impairment assessment of kinetek by an independent valuation consultant 
based on this assessment  we wrote down our million investment in kinetek shares 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to a provision of million in the effective tax rate reported in was  compared to reported in adjusting for the diomed write down in and the kinetek write down in  the rates would have been in versus in this decrease resulted primarily from the decrease in the canadian statutory tax rate

as at december   we also had investment tax credits of million available which will expire at various dates through the net deferred tax benefit of these and other temporary differences was estimated to be approximately million  and is ultimately subject to final determination by taxation authorities 
as of december   we established a valuation allowance of million against the tax effect of the write down of our investments in kinetek and diomed 
the valuation allowance is reviewed periodically and if the more likely than not criterion for accounting purposes changes  the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly 
see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook for the statements contained in this section are forward looking 
see the special note regarding forward looking statements 
results of operations we expect growth of our business in  driven primarily by increased visudyne sales and increased eligard sales 
a number of factors can impact sales of our products  see risk factors in item business 
while visudyne sales growth is projected  visudyne faces a competitor following the launch of macugen therapy by eyetech pharmaceuticals  inc and pfizer  inc 
in the us  and the impact of macugen sales on sales of visudyne cannot be predicted 
it is also difficult to accurately predict eligard sales given that this is a relatively new product and how quickly sales growth will be achieved is uncertain 
r d expenditures commensurate with the expansion of our development pipeline which resulted from our acquisition of atrix in november  we are planning an increase in our r d expenditures in our development efforts during the year will focus on octreotide three month formulation  lemuteporfin in benign prostatic hyperplasia  or bph  and continued development of visudyne and aczone 
trends or other factors expected to impact future operations our future operating results can be impacted by a number of factors 
the following factors or trends are reasonably expected to impact our results in increased competition in the amd market  increased impact of foreign exchange rates 
with visudyne sales outside the us surpassing sales within the us for the first time in  foreign exchange rates will have an increasingly significant impact on reported sales 
these rates are not predictable 
we employ hedging measures to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows 
our earnings and cash flow projections assume that we are effectively hedged 
the early part of has seen a downturn in the biopharmaceutical industry generally  our stock price and that of many others in the industry has recently declined 
if this downturn continues our stock price and our business might be materially affected  and our approved products are sold through marketing collaborations  and growth of our business will remain dependent on the sales and marketing efforts of our collaborative partners 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations  product development and capital expenditures primarily through proceeds from the commercialization of visudyne  public and private sales of equity securities  private placement of convertible senior notes  licensing and collaborative funding arrangements with strategic partners  and interest income 
the primary drivers of our operating cash flows during were cash receipts from visudyne sales and cash payments related to the following r d activities  sg a expenses  raw materials purchases and contract manufacturing fees for the manufacture of visudyne  interest expense related to our convertible notes and income tax installments 
for the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operations as opposed to million for the same period in higher cash receipts from visudyne sales million as opposed to million in were offset by the payment of income tax installments of million  interest payments related to the convertible notes of million  increased operating and inventory related expenditures of million  and lower foreign exchange contract gains of million as compared to the same period in the payment of cash income tax installments was the result of the liability for cash taxes in previously  our deferred tax assets tax losses and other deductions from prior periods were sufficient to eliminate cash taxes 
we expect to be cash taxable having utilized the majority of our tax losses and other tax assets in as well 
there was no interest paid on the convertible notes in as these notes were issued in august of with the first two scheduled interest payments occurring on march and september of during  acquisitions and capital expenditures accounted for the most significant cash outlays for investing activities  offset by net sales of short term investment securities to fund the acquisitions 
in march  we used million  net of cash acquired  to purchase kinetek  and in november  we used million  net of cash acquired  to purchase atrix 
we also used million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  primarily related to our pilot manufacturing facility in vancouver 
our cash flows from financing activities consisted primarily of cash receipts of million from stock option exercises 
interest and foreign exchange rates we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of our current assets and liabilities 
at december   we had an investment portfolio consisting of fixed interest rate securities with an average remaining maturity of approximately days 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by of levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments approximately million denominated in us dollars and million of us dollar denominated debt 
of the million us dollar denominated balance  million was held by our canadian parent company  approximately offsetting our us dollar denominated debt 
if the us dollar were to decrease in value by against the canadian dollar  the decline in fair value of our us dollar denominated cash  cash equivalents and short term investments would be mostly offset by the decline in the fair value of our million us dollar denominated long term debt  resulting in an immaterial amount of unrealized foreign currency translation loss 
as the functional currency of the us subsidiary is the us dollar  the us dollar denominated cash  cash equivalents and short term investments holdings of our us subsidiary do not result in foreign currency gains and losses in operations 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage exposures to currency rate fluctuations related to our expected future net income and cash flows 
the net unrealized gain in respect of such foreign currency contracts  as at december   was approximately million and was included in our results of operations 
we purchase goods and services primarily in canadian and us dollars and earn a significant portion of our revenues in us dollars 
foreign exchange risk is also managed by satisfying us dollar denominated expenditures with us dollar cash flows or assets 
contractual obligations during august of  we completed a rule a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually beginning march  the convertible senior notes are convertible at the option of the holders into common shares at the conversion rates referred to below only in the following circumstances i if our common share price  calculated over a specified period  has exceeded of the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes  ii if the trading price of the convertible senior notes over a specified period has fallen below of the amount equal to our then prevailing common share price times the applicable conversion rate provided that no notes may be converted pursuant to this condition after september   if  on any trading day during the specified period  the closing sale price of our common shares is greater than the conversion price in effect during such trading day and less than or equal to of such conversion price  iii if the convertible senior notes are called for redemption  or iv if specified corporate transactions were to occur 
the notes are convertible into our common shares  at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  which represents a conversion price of approximately per share 
the effect of approximately  shares related to the assumed conversion of the million convertible senior notes has been included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended december  and on or after september   we may at our option redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the redemption date 
we also have the option to redeem for cash all  but not less than all  of the notes at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the redemption date  in the event of certain changes to canadian withholding tax requirements 
on each of september   and  holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  that date 
on the occurrence of certain events  such as a change in control or termination of trading  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued unpaid interest to  but excluding  the repurchase date 
the notes also become immediately due and payable upon certain events of default by us 
total proceeds from the private placement were million  net of debt issue costs of million 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our future senior unsecured indebtedness 
the notes are effectively subordinated to all of our future secured indebtedness and all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries  including trade payables 
in the normal course of business  we enter into product supply agreements with contract manufacturers which expire at various dates through as well as other purchase commitments related to daily operations 
in addition  we have entered into operating lease agreements related to office equipment and office space 
the minimum annual commitments related to these agreements and our long term debt are as follows in thousands of us dollars payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt principal   interest      operating leases  purchase obligations     total      long term debt relates to the million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes described above 
the amounts in the table above include interest and principal payable to assuming neither conversion nor redemption occurs earlier 
operating leases comprise our long term leases of photocopiers  office space and postage meters 
purchase obligations comprise minimum purchase requirements of our product supply agreements with contract manufacturers million and other outstanding purchase commitments related to the normal course of business million 
off balance sheet arrangements except for the contractual arrangements described in the contractual obligations section above  we do not have any other arrangements that create risk for qlt and are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
general we believe that our available cash resources and working capital  and our cash generating capabilities  should be more than sufficient to satisfy the funding of product development programs and other operating and capital requirements  including the in licensing or acquisition of products and technologies for the reasonably foreseeable future 
the nature and form of any future in licensing or acquisition may have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
depending on the overall structure of current and future strategic alliances  we may have additional capital requirements related to the further development  marketing and distribution of existing or future products 
our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including our ability to successfully execute our integration strategies following the acquisition of atrix  the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing  fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and r d programs  the timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the levels of resources that we devote to the development of manufacturing  marketing and support capabilities  technological advances  the status of competitors  the cost of filing  prosecuting and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations  and the outcome of legal proceedings 
we may require additional capital in the future to fund clinical and product development costs for certain product applications or other technology opportunities  and strategic acquisitions of products  product candidates  technologies or other businesses 
accordingly  we may seek funding from a combination of sources  including product licensing  joint development and new collaborative arrangements  additional equity or debt financing or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional funding will be available or  if available  on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate capital is not available  our business could be materially and adversely affected
