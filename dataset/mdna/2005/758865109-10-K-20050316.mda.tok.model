executive overview we formed regent in november to acquire  own and operate clusters of radio stations in mid sized and small markets 
our primary objective is to increase regent s value to our stockholders by growing the number of radio stations and markets in which we operate and by improving the financial performance of the stations we own and operate in those markets 
we measure our progress by evaluating our ability to continue to increase the number of stations we own and to improve the post acquisition performance of the radio stations that we acquire 
growth in radio stations and markets 
since our inception  we have negotiated separate transactions for the acquisition and disposition of radio stations in various markets 
we have grown rapidly to our current size of radio stations in fifteen markets 
we achieved this growth through completed acquisitions of stations in markets and the sale or pending sale exchange of stations in eleven markets 
we expect to continue to grow our company by entering new markets where we see growth potential 
additionally  we seek to continue to strategically upgrade our presence in each of our markets through additional acquisitions when available and to continue to enhance our radio portfolio by selling or exchanging existing stations for stations in markets where there is more opportunity for growth 
of our radio station portfolio  stations have been owned or operated by our company for less than three years 
we consider this group as being in the developmental stage and are the stations that generally have the most opportunity for improved results going forward 
our strategy is illustrated by our february acquisition of radio stations in four markets from brill media company llc 
that acquisition positioned us to negotiate the following additional three complementary transactions see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which strengthened our position in certain markets and allowed us to enter a new  more attractive market the exchange of four radio stations in duluth  minnesota that we had acquired in the brill transaction  for five radio stations serving the evansville  indiana market  a market that we already had a presence in through the brill transaction 
this transaction was completed in january the exchange of six radio stations we previously owned in two markets  erie and lancaster reading  pennsylvania for five radio stations serving the bloomington  illinois market  creating regional synergies with our peoria  illinois stations 
this transaction was completed in july the purchase of two radio stations serving the ft 
collins greeley  colorado market to add to our cluster that we acquired in the brill acquisition 
this transaction was completed in november in order to fuel our growth  we have obtained funds from a variety of financing transactions  including our january initial public offering  our november private placement of common stock  our april public offering of common stock  and our credit facilities from financial institutions 
we currently have available million under our current credit facility for future acquisitions and other purposes  subject to the terms and conditions of our credit facility 
additionally  subject to market conditions  regent s financial performance and other factors  we have the ability to quickly access the public markets for up to approximately million through additional public offerings of common or preferred stock and or various debt securities pursuant to our currently effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission 
performance of our stations and markets 
the principal source of our revenue is the sale of broadcasting time on our radio stations for advertising 
our revenue is driven primarily by the amount of advertising time that we sell and the advertising rates that our radio stations are able to charge 
the advertising rates are based upon a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by periodic arbitron radio market reports 
in evaluating the performance of our various radio stations in our various markets  we focus on same station results as well as overall growth in our revenues and profitability 
we believe that meaningful quarter to quarter comparisons can be made for results of operations for those markets in which we have been operating for five full quarters  exclusive of stations acquired or disposed of during those periods 
additionally  barter is excluded in this comparison  as it customarily results in volatility between quarters  although differences over the full year are not material 
the advertising environment for the radio industry in was better than  growing over according to the radio advertising bureau rab 
according to the rab  local revenues increased and national revenues were flat 
these growth numbers are based on the top markets 
regent operates in small and mid sized markets which rely less on national advertising  therefore  regent s stations are not impacted as much when there are increases or decreases in national advertising 
our financial results are dependent on a number of factors  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  the ability to provide popular programming  local market and regional competition  relative efficiency of radio broadcasting compared to other advertising media  signal strength and government regulation and policies 
from time to time  the markets in which we operate experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect our revenue 
we believe  however  that this impact is somewhat mitigated by our diverse geographical presence 
our financial results are seasonal 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter to produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the fourth calendar quarter to produce the highest revenues for the year 
our operating results in any period may be affected by advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
to enhance the operations of our stations we have organized oversight of the radio stations into three regions with a regional vice president responsible for the operations in each region as well as their own market 
the synergies and idea sharing that has been generated by this alignment has been strategic as we continue to develop our stations 
additionally  we have invested in our corporate infrastructure to accommodate our acquisition strategy 
we believe that we are well positioned to rapidly and significantly increase the size of our company  with relatively minimal increases in corporate overhead 
prior to  and excluding gains on the sale or exchange of radio stations  we have historically generated net losses  primarily as a result of significant non cash charges for depreciation and amortization relating to the acquisitions of radio stations and interest charges on outstanding debt 
the fcc licenses and goodwill attributable to substantially all of our radio stations have historically been amortized on a straight line method over a to year period 
upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  in january  we ceased amortizing all goodwill and fcc licenses 
additionally  the goodwill and fcc licenses that we recorded for acquisitions that we completed subsequent to july   were not amortized due to this new guidance 
based upon the large number of acquisitions we consummated within the last four years  we anticipate that depreciation charges will continue to be significant for several years 
to the extent that we complete additional acquisitions  our interest expense and depreciation charges related to property and equipment and other intangible assets are likely to increase 
the sarbanes oxley act of section the sarbanes oxley act of was enacted on july   largely in response to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals involving some of the largest and well known companies in the united states 
in the second half of and in fiscal years and  we expended significant internal resources to comply with the new corporate governance mandates contained in this law and related regulations adopted by the securities and exchange commission  the department of labor and the nasdaq national market 
section of the sarbanes oxley act section became effective this year and required by december  that we document and test our internal controls over financial reporting  form an evaluation  based on sufficient evidence  as to the overall effectiveness of our system of internal controls over financial reporting and  issue an annual assertion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting beginning with the year ended december  we have completed the required section documentation and testing and issued our report on internal control over financial reporting found in item of this filing 
additionally  our external auditors have audited our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting including performing independent tests of the internal controls and have issued a report on internal control over financial reporting also found in item of this filing 
we incurred approximately million in increased costs in to comply with section although we currently are uncertain as to the ongoing long term cost effects  we expect out of pocket compliance costs to decrease in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  the most significant of which include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  allocating the purchase price of acquisitions  evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets  determining the recoverability of our long lived assets  and evaluating our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the basis for our estimates are historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  given the available information at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as pervasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
based upon past experience  these estimates have been a reliable method to recognize revenues and it is expected that this method will not change in the future 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets our fcc licenses qualify as indefinite lived intangible assets  and represent a significant portion of the assets on our balance sheet 
we apply a fair value approach employing a discounted cash flow methodology to test impairment of both indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill on a market by market basis 
to arrive at a value for discounted cash flow of a market  management relies upon estimates of future cash flows and the effects of changes in business conditions 
local economic conditions in each of our markets could impact whether an fcc license or goodwill is impaired  as a decrease or increase in market revenue could negatively or positively impact discounted cash flows 
additionally  other factors such as interest rates  the performance of the s p  as well as capital expenditures  can affect the discounted cash flow analysis 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  an impairment loss will be recorded in operating income 
allocation of acquisition purchase price we believe the determination of the fair value of our acquired fcc licenses is a critical accounting policy as their value is significant relative to our total assets 
we typically engage independent third parties to appraise the fair value of our acquired tangible and intangible assets  however  in some instances we apply our own direct valuation methods to determine the value of tangible assets and fcc licenses 
the fcc license valuation utilized employs a discounted cash flow analysis with critical assumptions about market growth  cash flow growth  multiples of cash flow  and other economic factors 
determining the recoverability of long lived assets our long lived assets to be held and used fixed assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
if we were to determine that the carrying amount of an asset was not recoverable  we would record an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
we determine the fair value of our long lived assets based upon the market value of similar assets  if available  or independent appraisals  if necessary 
long lived assets to be disposed of and or held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
we determine the fair value of these assets in the same manner as described for assets held and used 
the amount of intangibles with definite lives that we have recorded is not material 
deferred tax assets at december   we had a deferred tax asset of approximately million before valuation allowance  the primary component of which is our net operating loss carryforwards 
while we have a valuation allowance of million set up for tax assets expiring through  we have determined that it is not necessary to record a valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards for years through  based on estimated future taxable income during those years 
our estimated future taxable income in those periods takes into consideration the run off of significant tax amortization related to existing fcc licenses and deductible goodwill by however  there is no assurance that our projections will be achieved  and if our taxable income projections fall short  we most likely would need to record an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that would not be utilized 
the need to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is reviewed quarterly  and if we were to determine that we would be unable to realize a portion  or the remainder of the deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded as expense in the period such determination was made 
additionally  if it were determined that we would be able to utilize a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards that are reserved for in the valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 
if our provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate due to unfavorable law changes or unforeseen circumstances  we could experience losses in excess of the current or deferred income tax provisions we have established 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we routinely review customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for potential losses 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could affect the ability of our customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
a one percent change to our allowance as a percent of our outstanding accounts receivable at december  would cause a decrease in net income of approximately million  net of tax

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes apb opinion no

sfas r is applicable to share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights  and employee stock purchase plans 
formerly  under the provisions of sfas  companies were permitted to follow the recognition and measurement principles of apb and provide additional footnote disclosures of what net income or loss would have been had the company followed the fair value based provisions contained in sfas sfas r requires companies to recognize in their financial statements the compensation expense relating to share based payment transactions for stock options that have future vesting provisions or as newly granted beginning on the grant date of such options 
we will be required to implement sfas r in interim periods beginning after july  if we had followed the provisions of sfas r for the years ended december    and  net income loss and basic and diluted income loss per common share would have been the amounts disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for those years 
we are currently evaluating all of the provisions of sfas r and its expected effect on us  including  among other items  reviewing compensation strategies related to stock based awards  selecting an option pricing model  and determining a transition method

non monetary exchanges of assets that do not have commercial substance shall be measured based on the recorded amounts of the non monetary assets relinquished instead of the fair values of the exchanged assets 
the statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after june   but allows early adoption for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date the statement was issued

net broadcast revenues the radio industry overall experienced better revenue growth in versus according to the rab  radio revenues grew in versus when revenues grew only 
radio advertising revenues in benefited from the presidential election and other political contests on a local level 
in contrast  during  the beginning of the war in iraq and the continuing war on terrorism negatively impacted the advertising environment 
the rab further indicated that in local revenues grew and national revenues were flat 
in  our net broadcast revenues were made up of approximately of local revenue and national revenue 
we had net broadcast revenues of approximately million in  which represented a increase over net revenues of approximately million 
of the approximately million increase  approximately million was attributable to the results of the bloomington stations we began to operate under a tba on february  the remaining million increase in net revenues was attributable to stations we owned for both years 
the increase in net revenue in of million resulted from increased advertising revenue and was comprised primarily of million of local revenue and million of national revenue  million of political revenue and million of event and concert revenue 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in non cash barter revenue of million and other miscellaneous revenue of million 
station operating expenses operating expenses were approximately million in  compared to approximately million in  an increase of million 
the increase is primarily a result of eleven months of expense for our bloomington stations that we began to operate on february   which represented approximately million of the increase 
the remaining million of lower expense was attributable to lower non cash barter expense in of approximately million offset by increased technical and programming expense of approximately million at the stations we have owned for all of and depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased  from approximately million in  to approximately million in this million increase is the result of additional amortization expense of million and depreciation expense of million related to the bloomington acquisition and million of depreciation for stations operated during both and  partly due to new facilities in our utica and peoria markets 
corporate expense corporate general and administrative expense increased million in to million compared to million in the increase was primarily made up of increased sarbanes oxley compliance expense of approximately million and increased incentive compensation of million 
savings in business travel offset increases in payroll and technology costs 
interest expense interest expense increased by from million in to million in excluding the write off of approximately million in unamortized deferred finance costs associated with our previous credit facility in  interest expense increased million 
approximately million of the increase was due to the allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations for a full year in  versus a partial year in average outstanding long term debt balances in were million compared to million in the increase in the average debt outstanding is due to the repurchase of million of regent common stock in  the payment upon closing of the bloomington swap with citadel of million  and the closing on the purchase of two stations in ft 
collins for million  partially offset by debt pay downs 
the increase in interest expense was also impacted by a higher weighted average interest rate in of due to higher rates and interest related to a hedge that became effective in the third quarter 
the weighted average interest rate in was 
the increased average borrowings in over contributed approximately million to the increase in interest expense and the higher rates added another million to interest expense in income taxes we recorded income tax expense of approximately million in on income from continuing operations  which represented a effective rate 
the rate includes a federal rate as well as a state rate of approximately 
additionally  the rate includes miscellaneous adjustments of and was also reduced by attributable to a decrease in valuation allowance from the expiration and utilization of state net operating loss carryforwards nol s and other miscellaneous adjustments

for tax purposes  we elected section treatment and deferred a portion of the gain 
same station results our revenues are produced exclusively by our radio stations and we believe that an analysis of the revenue of stations that we owned for the full years and is important because it presents a more direct view of whether or not our stations are operating effectively 
nevertheless  this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for broadcast net revenue  operating income loss  net income loss  net cash provided by used in operating activities or any other measure for determining our operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
while acquisitions have affected the comparability of our operating results to those of  we believe meaningful quarter to quarter net broadcast revenue comparisons can be made for results of operations for those markets in which we have been operating for five full quarters  exclusive of markets disposed of during those years 
the following comparable results between and are listed in the table below by quarter  excluding the effect of barter transactions in thousands 
same station revenue was up in the first quarter due to an improving economy at the local level and the fact that the first quarter of was negatively impacted by the war in iraq 
of the approximately million increase in net revenues between the first quarter of and the first quarter of  million came from local sales efforts which was offset by a decline of approximately million in national revenues 
net net revenue revenue change quarter stations in markets net broadcast revenue less remaining stations and barter effect same station net broadcast revenue revenue growth was up in the second quarter similarly to the first quarter where we saw strong growth in our local sales efforts accounting for all of the million increase in net revenues year over year 
net net revenue revenue change quarter stations in markets net broadcast revenue less remaining stations and barter effect same station net broadcast revenue revenue growth was in the third quarter as local sales growth again contributed to the strong same station revenue growth with local sales growing approximately 
national revenue decreased by compared to last year 
net net revenue revenue change quarter stations in markets net broadcast revenue less remaining stations and barter effect same station net broadcast revenue revenue growth in the fourth quarter was up on the strength of local revenue growth of approximately million and political revenue growth of approximately million due to the presidential race and local issues in some of our markets 
all other revenue sources accounted for approximately million 
net net revenue revenue change quarter stations in markets net broadcast revenue less remaining stations and barter effect same station net broadcast revenue compared to results from operations in  as compared to  were affected considerably by full year results for our acquisitions in evansville  indiana and ft 
collins greeley  colorado which we began operating in september  and to a lesser extent our acquisitions of radio stations in flint and grand rapids  michigan see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  in march  we began operating five additional stations in evansville  indiana under a time brokerage agreement with clear channel broadcasting  inc and its related affiliates 
accordingly  the results of our operations in are not comparable to those of the prior period  nor are they necessarily indicative of future results 
additionally during  we disposed of our duluth  minnesota  and erie and lancaster reading  pennsylvania markets

net broadcast revenues the radio industry experienced several difficult years as the effects of september   the war on terrorism  the war in iraq and other related events  negatively impacted the advertising environment 
overall advertising growth remained somewhat flat in with national business showing larger growth than local business 
we felt the impact of such matters and we believe our financial performance was comparable to the radio industry as a whole 
however  the national revenue growth was not as significant to us as national advertising only represented approximately of our revenue 
additionally  eleven of our markets were over in terms of market revenue rank where national business growth was not as significant as in the larger markets 
accordingly  our results were much more impacted by locally driven revenues 
net broadcast revenues of approximately million in represented a increase over net revenues of approximately million 
approximately million of the increase was attributable to full year results for stations we acquired in results for the stations we began operating under time brokerage agreements in contributed approximately million of the net revenue increase  and the difference was due to revenue decreases at stations we owned for both years 
the increase in net revenue in of million was comprised primarily of million of local revenue  million of national revenue  and million of non cash barter revenue 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in political revenues of million  as was an off election year  and other miscellaneous revenue of million 
station operating expenses operating expenses were approximately million in  compared to approximately million in the increase was primarily a result of full year results for the stations we acquired in  which represented approximately million of the increase  as well as expenses for the stations we purchased or operated under time brokerage agreements in  which added approximately million of additional operating expense 
the remaining million of cost reduction was attributable to cost savings at the stations we owned for all of and part of the savings was attributable to compensation savings as a result of the revenue shortfalls 
as was a difficult year for advertising revenue  it was important for us to balance our investment spending with cost control 
our discretionary dollars remained relatively flat to prior year spending 
we continued to invest in research and promotional expenses  which we incur to properly target our intended demographic audiences within our markets  as well as to promote our radio stations through various advertising campaigns and contest prize give aways  as we believe these expenditures promote long term growth at our radio stations 
expenses directly related to the generation of revenue such as sales commissions increased approximately million 
the administrative costs required to operate the facilities at our markets such as power and rent increased by approximately million and our compensation and benefits expenses increased by approximately million 
non cash barter expense increased by million in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by  from approximately million in  to approximately million in this was primarily due to increased depreciation expense related to acquisitions that were closed during and the second half of corporate expense corporate general and administrative expenses in total remained relatively flat in compared to however  variances occurred within various accounts 
those variances include increases in payroll expense due to annual performance increases  travel and entertainment  technology communications expense as a result of the addition of four markets purchased from brill media  management conferences not held in the prior year  and increased rent expense primarily as a result of the termination of the sublease of our former corporate office space 
these increases were offset by an approximate decrease in incentive compensation due to the difficult business revenue environment in interest expense interest expense increased by from million in to million in the increase was due to debt that was incurred to close the brill transaction in february  as well as the write off of approximately million in unamortized deferred finance costs related to our old credit facility 
average outstanding long term debt balances in were million compared to million in the increase in interest expense was somewhat mitigated by a lower weighted average interest rate in of compared to in income taxes we recorded income tax expense of approximately million in on income from continuing operations  which represented a effective rate 
this represented a federal rate and a state rate 
additionally  was attributed to a valuation allowance we recorded for state net operating losses generated in and miscellaneous adjustments accounted for a decrease of 
we recorded income tax expense of approximately million in  prior to the income tax benefit from cumulative effect of accounting change 
this represented a federal rate and a state rate  and included million of income tax expense related to the establishment of valuation allowances on our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards scheduled to expire in the years through in arriving at the determination as to the amount of the valuation allowance required for the year ended december   we considered the impact of deferred tax liabilities resulting from purchase transactions  statutory restrictions on the use of operating losses  and a tax planning strategy available to us 
we determined that when considering the current state of private market values for radio station assets  it would be more likely than not that we would not be able to implement our tax planning strategy within the foreseeable future resulting in the establishment of the valuation allowance 
we determined that it was not necessary in to record an additional valuation allowance against our federal net operating loss carryforwards for years through  based on estimated future taxable income during those years 
our estimated future taxable income in those periods takes into consideration the run off of significant tax amortization related to existing fcc licenses and deductible goodwill by discontinued operations during  we disposed of our duluth  minnesota  and erie and lancaster reading  pennsylvania markets

the following comparable results between and includes the results of stations in markets and are listed in the table below by quarter  excluding the effect of barter transactions in thousands 
same station revenue grew in the first quarter because sales were negatively impacted by the war in iraq  as march was particularly affected after two fairly successful months in january and february

since our inception  we have demonstrated our ability to access the public markets to raise equity  and we have also demonstrated our ability to access the commercial bank market having negotiated three separate credit facilities with a number of banking institutions since the bank market is currently very favorable for the radio sector  as radio companies de levered their balance sheets in due to lower acquisition activity resulting in a strong demand for radio loans 
in december  we amended our existing credit facility to reflect the pricing in the current market  as well as to allow us to borrow up to million for repurchases of our own stock subject to certain conditions 
currently  our board of directors has authorized us to expend up to million for stock repurchases 
we believe that we have sufficient access to funds so that we will be able to continue to pursue our growth strategy during if we are able to find suitable acquisitions at acceptable prices 
we also anticipate that if we were to make an acquisition that would require borrowings in excess of our current borrowing capacity  we would be able to fund our capital needs from either refinancing our current credit facility  or by obtaining financing through a variety of options available to us but not limited to  our shelf registration statement 
while our focus has remained on being acquisitive  we do have the flexibility to repurchase our own stock when the stock price is at a level such that we believe it is beneficial to our shareholders to repurchase it 
while we may repurchase our stock from time to time in  we do not intend to increase our leverage in order to do so 
we expect the long term liquidity of the company to be strong  as radio stations typically do not have large capital requirements 
excluding projects to consolidate duplicate facilities in a market  our capital expenditures have been approximately of our net revenue

our term loan began to reduce on december  with an initial payment of approximately million and continues quarterly thereafter to termination 
the revolving credit facility begins to reduce on june  and continues thereafter to termination 
our liquidity is dependent on the renewal of our broadcasting licenses 
radio stations operate under renewable broadcasting licenses that are ordinarily granted by the fcc for maximum terms of eight years 
a station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending 
during the periods when renewal applications are pending  petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by interested parties  including members of the public 
the fcc is required to hold hearings on a station s renewal application if a substantial or material question of fact exists as to whether the station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity 
if  as a result of an evidentiary hearing  the fcc determines that the licensee has failed to meet certain requirements and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of a lesser sanction  then the fcc may deny a license renewal application 
historically  fcc licenses have generally been renewed
