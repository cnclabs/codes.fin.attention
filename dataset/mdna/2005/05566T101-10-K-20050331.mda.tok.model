executive summary growth  expansion  and funding trends 
in early  with interest rates at historical lows and mortgage loan origination income at record highs  management adopted a twelve to twenty four month strategy to grow net interest income sufficient to offset an expected decline in mortgage origination income 
with the leadership of our chief operating officer  the company opened its first commercial loan production office in high point  north carolina 
high point was a natural fit for the company  since the company s chief operating officer was a native and current resident  and many civic and business leaders of high point had been very instrumental to the development and success of our bank  not only as customers  but as shareholders  directors and incorporators 
the company s chairman  w 
groome fulton  jr 
is a high point native  as are several current and former members of the board of directors  including dr 
lenin j 
peters  d 
vann williford  dr 
lloyd m 
higgins  richard f 
wood  and bob m 
burleson 
with the help of two additional bankers with experience in the high point market  this office  opened in june of  finished with loans outstanding well ahead of our initial projections 
with the reception and success that our loan production office in high point enjoyed  management continued its search for seasoned commercial lenders of high character in attractive  contiguous markets 
in september of  we introduced three bankers in the salisbury  north carolina market and opened our second commercial loan production office 
the salisbury loan production office ended  just as in high point  with total loans outstanding exceeding our initial projections 

table of contents these markets posed new opportunities and challenges for the company 
with the salisbury market being in the heart of one of the fastest growing areas in north carolina  the growth opportunities were obvious 
however  the challenges were just as ominous 
this market and surrounding lending area was the first where the company had no board representation and the first outside of the familiar piedmont triad region 
realizing that the credit administration and risk management functions of the bank were going to be challenged from a growing volume of loan requests from these new markets where we have limited institutional experience  management made a commitment to the staffing  technology  and reorganization of these areas in and in addition to contributing to a and growth in the loan portfolio  net of allowance for loan losses  in and  respectively  the expansion over the past two years also served another vital function 
it provided greater diversification of our loan portfolio into markets less dependent on manufacturing 
with the large growth in the company s loan portfolio experienced over an month period  it was imperative that the pricing characteristics of this new growth compliment that of the existing portfolio 
with rates at or near historical lows  management determined that it was in the long term best interest of our shareholders to emphasize variable rate pricing 
we strategically avoided locking in a large volume of fixed rate loans at or near historically low levels 
the company s loan portfolio  net of allowance for loan losses  increased by million and million in and  respectively  while loans having variable rate pricing increased by million over that period compared to a million decline in loans having fixed rate pricing 
the high percentage of loans with variable rate pricing has resulted in a short term decline in our yield on loans  and ultimate reduction in our net interest margin in both and the loan production model also posed another major challenge to our company 
without a retail deposit base at either of these locations  funding in our traditional manner would have been excessively expensive and virtually impossible 
the company turned to the wholesale deposit markets as its primary funding vehicle during the fourth quarter of and all of the wholesale deposit markets served two major functions for our company availability  and term selection 
unlike the company s local markets where investors are often reluctant to invest in cd s with terms greater than months  the company was able to obtain cd funding through the wholesale markets with terms ranging from six months to ten years at rates highly competitive with those quoted in our local markets 
with interest rates on cd s being near historically low levels  management felt it prudent to use the wholesale market to lock in some longer term fixed rate funding for terms of months to years 
as of december   the company had million in wholesale cd s outstanding  of which  there is million at an average rate of maturing in  million with an average rate of maturing in  and million maturing after with an average rate of 
in addition to wholesale cd s  the company has million in long term borrowings through the fhlb in atlanta with maturities in to with an average rate of 
while we believe this to be a strategy that will be beneficial to our shareholders long term  locking in longer term fixed rates on the deposit side contributed to the decline in the company s net interest margin in both and despite a decline in the bank s net interest margin from in to in  the bank s net interest income increased  or million in compared to by accepting a slightly smaller net interest margin  the bank was able to accelerate the growth of our loan portfolio  price our loans and deposits to take advantage of future rate increases  and still report record increases in our net interest income 
each of these results was expected as part of the strategic plan implemented during with assets growing at a compounded annual rate of over the past three years  it was imperative that part of our strategic plan be devoted to capital planning 
as noted in prior reports  the company has utilized alternative forms of regulatory capital to supplement our shareholders equity in order to remain well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
the company has issued three blocks of year variable rate junior subordinated debentures to its wholly owned capital trusts million in april of priced at month libor  million in september of 
table of contents priced at month libor  and million in september of priced at month libor 
these debentures fully and unconditionally guarantee the preferred securities issued by the trust 
these debentures are classified as long term debt on our company s financial statements 
during  in addition to increases in long term debt  total shareholders equity increased by million  or 
the company reported net income of million  accrued  for cash dividends declared in december which were paid in march of  and repurchased stock amounting to  as part of the stock repurchase plan approved by the board of directors 
the company repurchased  shares on the open market  at prices and block sizes in accordance with the provisions of the stock repurchase plan and relevant securities laws 
all capital ratios continue to place the bank in excess of the minimum required to be deemed a well capitalized bank by regulatory measures 
the bank has maintained liquidity at what it believes to be an appropriate level 
liquid assets  consisting of cash and demand balances due from banks  interest earning deposits in other banks and investment securities available for sale  ended the year in the aggregate at million  or of total assets 
the bank  as a member of the fhlb  has an investment of million in fhlb stock 
the bank s investment in premises and equipment increased by million as a result of the cost of building our full service office in high point and the cost of the land for our full service office in salisbury 
as part of the acquisition of independence bank  the company recorded goodwill of million which is not amortizable 
the  in core deposit intangible associated with that transaction has a carrying balance of  at december  the core deposit intangible asset is being amortized into expense over ten years 
net interest margin trends 
with rates at historically low levels  the bank made a conscious decision to limit the growth of our fixed rate loan portfolio 
while these fixed rate credits provide short term spread  they could have a detrimental impact as the federal reserve increases short term rates to levels reached during the previous interest rate cycle 
in  the bank reported total loan growth of over million 
during the year  variable rate loans increased by million  while fixed rate loans declined by million 
as would be expected  in this low interest rate environment  the market rate for variable rate loans is markedly less than the rates being charged on fixed rates loans 
this has resulted in the bank s yield on earning assets declining as the mix of the portfolio shifts more towards the lower yielding variable rate product 
the funding for the loan growth in came primarily from one area  wholesale funding sources 
on the wholesale funding side  management and the board of directors decided to lock in intermediate term funding costs at historically low interest rates by raising funds through the wholesale markets in terms ranging from months to five years 
these longer term time deposits and term borrowings from the fhlb served two purposes 
one  they offset the interest rate risk associated with the fixed rate loans and long term municipal securities that the bank holds on its balance sheet  and two  they lengthened the average maturity of our term funding sources in anticipation of the federal reserve raising short term rates consistently and aggressively 
it is management and the board s belief that this action is in the company s best interest both from a prudence and strategic perspective 
this longer term wholesale funding carries higher rates than that of very short term funding 
this strategy has also contributed to a reduction in the bank s net interest margin in the short term 
during  the company experienced an expected decline in mortgage origination income 
with mortgage rates rising slightly  the refinance volume declined significantly  resulting in a decrease in mortgage fee income from million in to  in the income derived from the mortgage department is very rate sensitive  as evidenced in as management and the board looks to  it is uncertain how long the federal reserve will continue to raise short term interest rates and at what pace 
if the federal reserve continues on their measured approach  and short term rates gradually increase basis points every six weeks  the company is well positioned to report double digit percentage gains in net interest income in management and the board remain convinced that the asset liability strategy discussed previously will benefit the company over the next three to five year period and is consistent with proven results of the past 

table of contents financial condition december  and the most significant factor affecting the bank s growth in was the million increase in net loans 
this total increase was composed principally of an increase of million in loans secured by real estate other than construction  an increase of million in loans secured by construction purpose real estate and a decline of million in commercial and industrial loans 
the bank has maintained liquidity at what it believes to be an appropriate level

the bank  as a member of the fhlb  has an investment of million in fhlb stock 
the bank s investment in premises and equipment increased by million as a result of the cost of building our full service office in high point and the cost of the land for our full service office in salisbury 
as part of the acquisition of independence bank  the company recorded goodwill of million which is not amortizable 
the  in core deposit intangible associated with that transaction has a carrying balance of  at december  the core deposit intangible asset is being amortized into expense over ten years 
funding to support higher total assets held at year end was provided by an increase of million in deposit accounts  an increase of million in short term borrowings  and an increase of million in long term debt 
the increase in deposit accounts was due to an increase of million in certificates of deposit 
large denomination certificates of deposit increased by million in  and at year end included million in large denomination certificates of deposit obtained through the wholesale markets 
these certificates had maturities ranging from six months to five years at rates at or below those being quoted in the local markets at the time of closing

net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loan and investment securities portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
for this purpose  volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning

during the years ended december  and  average interest earning assets were million  and million  respectively 
during these same years  the bank s tax effected net yields on average interest earning assets were and  respectively 
the decline in the net interest margin from to was due primarily to two factors the company s loan portfolio  which grew by million during  had its variable rate portfolio increase by million  which carries a lower rate than comparable loans with a fixed rate of interest 
the fixed rate loan portfolio actually decline during by million 
the disadvantage associated with the lower rates on variable rate loans are weighted against the positives associated with the ability of these variable rate loans to reprice upwards as rates increase 
in order to provide future pricing mobility of these loans  considering the historically low interest rate environment in which the bank operated during  the majority of loans originated in carried variable rate pricing 
the bank experienced a flat year in terms of growth in the non interest bearing demand account balances 
this area provides the bank with interest free money to supplement and offset the costs associated with fully funding loans through time deposits 
with no growth in the non interest bearing sector  the bank was very dependent on growth from the wholesale funding sector 
the bank utilized the wholesale funding markets to increase wholesale time deposits with terms of months to months by million in  while short term advances from the fhlb that reprice daily increased by million

provision for loan losses 
the bank recorded a million provision for loan losses in  representing an increase of  from the  provision made in provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management

the rates earned on a significant portion of the bank s loans adjust immediately when index rates such as the prime rate change 
conversely  most interest bearing liabilities  including certificates of deposit and borrowings  have rates fixed until maturity

the provision for income taxes of million in and million in represent and  respectively  of income before income taxes 
these effective rates are lower than the blended federal north carolina statutory rate of principally due to tax exempt income from municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance 
liquidity the bank s sources of funds are deposits  cash and demand balances due from other banks  interest earning deposits in other banks and investment securities available for sale

in addition  at december   the bank had credit availability with the fhlb of approximately million  with million outstanding at december  total deposits were million  and million at december  and  respectively 
as a result of the company s loan growth exceeding local deposit growth  the bank utilized its wholesale funding sources  such as borrowings from the fhlb and the wholesale cd market

while the bank will need to pay competitive rates to retain these deposits at their maturities  there are other subjective factors that will determine their continued retention 
based upon prior experience  the bank anticipates that a substantial portion of outstanding certificates of deposit will renew upon maturity 

table of contents management anticipates that the bank will rely primarily upon customer deposits  loan repayments and current earnings to provide liquidity  and will use funds thus generated to make loans and to purchase securities  primarily securities issued by the federal government and its agencies  municipal securities and mortgage backed securities 
in the normal course of business there are various outstanding contractual obligations of the bank that will require future cash outflows

table following this discussion  contractual obligations and commitments  summarizes the bank s contractual obligations and commitments as of december capital resources at december  and  the company s tangible shareholders equity totaled million and million  respectively 
the company s tangible equity to asset ratio on those dates was and  respectively 
these ratios are above regulatory minimums necessary to be classified as well capitalized  and show continued effort in our plan to leverage tangible equity capital to better enhance our return on average tangible equity 
the company and the bank are subject to minimum capital requirements 
see part  item description of business supervision and regulation 
all capital ratios place the bank in excess of the minimum required to be deemed adequately capitalized by regulatory measures 
during  the bank s total capital to risk weighted assets ratio fell below the threshold to be considered a well capitalized institution as a result of the high concentration of cash paid in the independence transaction 
the company s wholly owned capital trust issued million in trust preferred securities during the first half of to re establish the bank s capital levels to well capitalized 
in  the company s capital trusts issued million of year trust preferred securities to augment regulatory tier i and tier ii capital 
the bank s tier i leverage ratio as of december  and was and  respectively 
note o to the accompanying consolidated financial statements presents an analysis of the company s and bank s regulatory capital position as of december  with the anticipated issuance of additional trust preferred securities  to be treated as tier ii capital  after december   management expects that the bank will remain well capitalized for regulatory purposes throughout  although there can be no assurance that the bank will not fall into the adequately capitalized classification 
asset liability management the bank s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the bank s interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the market place 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting the bank s earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from volatile interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
the bank maintains  and has complied with  an asset liability management policy approved by the board of directors of the bank and the company that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing the following ratios and trend analysis liquidity  equity  volatile liability dependence  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
this policy is to control the exposure of its earnings to changing interest rates by generally endeavoring to maintain a position within a narrow range around an earnings neutral position  which is defined as the mix of assets and liabilities that generate a net interest margin that is least affected by interest rate changes 
when suitable lending opportunities are not sufficient to utilize available funds  the bank has generally invested such funds in securities  primarily us treasury securities  securities issued by governmental agencies  mortgage backed securities and securities issued by local governmental municipalities 
the securities portfolio 
table of contents contributes to the bank s  and thus the company s profits  and plays an important part in the overall interest rate management 
however  management of the securities portfolio alone cannot balance overall interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio must be used in combination with other asset liability techniques to actively manage the balance sheet 
the primary objectives in the overall management of the securities portfolio are safety  yield  liquidity  asset liability management interest rate risk  and investing in securities that can be pledged for public deposits or as collateral for fhlb advances 
in reviewing the needs of the bank with regard to proper management of its asset liability program  the bank s management estimates its future needs  taking into consideration historical periods of high loan demand and low deposit balances  estimated loan and deposit increases due to increased demand through marketing  and forecasted interest rate changes 
a number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulations and interest sensitivity gap analyses 
an income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayments on loan and loan backed assets  cash flows and maturities of other investment securities  loan and deposit volumes and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
based on the results of the income simulation model as of december   looking forward for months  the bank would expect an increase in net interest income of million if interest rates increase from current rates by basis points and a decrease in net interest income of  if interest rates decrease from current rates by basis points 
when factoring in other interest sensitive revenues and costs  such as the income derived from mortgage originations  the effect of a basis point rise will produce a net increase in interest sensitive income of million  while a decline in rates of basis points will result in a reduction in interest sensitive income of  the analysis of an institution s interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during a given period of time is another standard tool for the measurement of the exposure to interest rate risk 
the management believes that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance  it should be used in conjunction with other methods of evaluating interest rate risk 
table following this discussion  interest rate sensitivity analysis sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are projected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets or liabilities 
loans with adjustable rates are shown as being due at the end of the next upcoming adjustment period 
money market deposit accounts are considered rate sensitive and place in the shortest period  while negotiable order of withdrawal or other transaction accounts are assumed to be more stable sources that are less price elastic and have been placed in the longest period 
in making the gap computations  none of the assumptions sometimes made regarding prepayment rates and deposit decay rates have been used for any interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  the table does not reflect scheduled principal payments which will be received throughout the lives of the loans 
the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by such assumptions 
table illustrates that if assets and liabilities reprice in the time intervals indicated in the table  the bank is asset sensitive within three months  liability sensitive within twelve months  and asset sensitive thereafter 
as stated above  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
for instance  while the table is based on the assumption that money market accounts are immediately sensitive to movements in rates  the bank expects that in a changing rate environment the amount of the 
table of contents adjustment in interest rates for such accounts would be less than the adjustment in categories of assets which are considered to be immediately sensitive 
the same is true for all other interest bearing transaction accounts 
additionally  certain assets have features which restrict changes in the interest rates of such assets both on a short term basis and over the lives of such assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in market interest rates 
due to these shortcomings  the bank places primary emphasis on its income simulation model when managing its exposure to changes in interest rates 
lending activities general 
the bank provides to its customers a full range of short to medium term commercial  mortgage  construction and personal loans  both secured and unsecured 
the bank also makes real estate mortgage and construction loans 
the bank s loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing its lending operations 
generally  the guidelines address the types of loans that the bank seeks  target markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  interest rate and yield considerations and compliance with laws and regulations 
all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness to the bank  including the indebtedness of any guarantor 
the policies are reviewed and approved at least annually by the boards of directors of the bank and the company 
the bank supplements its own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan audits by internal loan examiners and outside professionals experienced in loan review work 
the bank has focused its portfolio lending activities on higher yielding commercial loans 
table following this discussion provides an analysis of the bank s loan portfolio composition by type of loan as of the end of each of the last five years 
table following this discussion presents  at december   i the aggregate maturities or repricings of loans in the named categories of the company s loan portfolio and ii the aggregate amounts of variable and fixed rate loans that mature or reprice after one year 
commercial loans 
commercial business lending is a major focus of the bank s lending activities 
at december   the bank s commercial and industrial loan portfolio equaled million or of total loans  as compared with million or of total loans at december  commercial and industrial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital  expansion  and other business purposes 
short term working capital loans generally are secured by accounts receivable  inventory and or equipment 
the bank also makes term commercial loans secured by real estate  which are categorized as real estate loans 
lending decisions are based on an evaluation of the financial strength  management and credit history of the borrower  and the quality of the collateral securing the loan 
with few exceptions  the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment 
commercial loans generally provide greater yields and reprice more frequently than other types of loans  such as real estate loans 
more frequent repricing means that yields on our commercial loans adjust with changes in interest rates 
real estate loans 
real estate loans are made for purchasing  constructing and refinancing one to four family  five or more family and commercial properties 
real estate loans also include home equity credit lines 
the bank offers fixed and adjustable rate options and provides customers access to long term conventional real estate loans through its mortgage loan department which makes secondary market conforming loans that are originated with a commitment from a correspondent to purchase the loan within days of closing 
residential real estate loans amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the bank s residential mortgage loans are generally secured by properties located within the bank s 
table of contents market area 
many of the residential mortgage loans that the bank makes are originated for the account of third parties 
such loans are classified as loans held for sale in the financial statements 
the bank receives fees for each such loan originated  with such fees aggregating  for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the bank anticipates that it will continue to be an active originator of residential loans for the account of third parties 
commercial real estate loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
this lending has involved loans secured principally by commercial buildings for office  storage and warehouse space  and by agricultural properties 
generally in underwriting commercial real estate loans  the bank requires the personal guaranty of borrowers and a demonstrated cash flow capability sufficient to service the debt 
loans secured by commercial real estate may be in greater amount and involve a greater degree of risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties 
the bank originates one to four family residential construction loans for the construction of custom homes where the home buyer is the borrower and provides financing to builders and consumers for the construction of pre sold homes 
the company generally receives a pre arranged permanent financing commitment from an outside entity prior to financing the construction of pre sold homes 
the company lends to builders who have demonstrated a favorable record of performance and profitable operations and who are building in markets that management believes it understands and in which it is comfortable with the economic conditions 
the company also makes commercial real estate construction loans  generally for owner occupied properties 
the company further endeavors to limit its construction lending risk through adherence to established underwriting procedures 
also  the company generally requires documentation of all draw requests and utilizes loan officers to inspect the project prior to paying any draw requests from the builder 
with few exceptions  the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment on construction loans 
loans to individuals 
loans to individuals include automobile loans  boat and recreational vehicle financing and miscellaneous secured and unsecured personal loans 
consumer loans generally can carry significantly greater risks than other loans  even if secured  because the collateral often consists of rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles and equipment 
repossessed collateral securing a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan 
consumer loan collections are sensitive to job loss  illness and other personal factors 
the bank attempts to manage the risks inherent in consumer lending by following established credit guidelines and underwriting practices designed to minimize risk of loss 
commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of business  the bank enters into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit that are not included in loans receivable  net  presented on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the bank applies the same credit standards to these commitments as it uses in all its lending activities and has included these commitments in its lending risk evaluations 
the bank s exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments 
see table and note p to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
asset quality the bank considers asset quality to be of primary importance  and employs a formal internal loan review process to ensure adherence to its lending policy as approved by the bank s and the company s boards of directors 
it is the responsibility of each lending officer to assign an appropriate risk grade to every loan originated 
credit administration  through the loan review process  validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment 
in addition  as a given loan s credit quality improves or deteriorates  it is credit administration s responsibility to change the borrower s risk grade accordingly 
the function of determining the allowance for loan losses is fundamentally driven by the risk grade system 
in determining the allowance for loan losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings  particular emphasis is placed on the results of the loan review process 
consideration is also given to historical loan loss experience  the value and adequacy of collateral  economic conditions in the bank s market area and other factors 
for loans determined to be impaired  the allowance is based on discounted cash flows 
table of contents using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the bank s policy regarding past due loans normally requires a prompt charge off to the allowance for loan losses following timely collection efforts and a thorough review 
further efforts are then pursued through various means available 
loans carried in a non accrual status are generally collateralized and probable losses are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming assets table following this discussion sets forth  for the period indicated  information with respect to the bank s nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  total nonperforming loans nonaccrual loans plus restructured loans  and total nonperforming assets 
the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on loans  unless we place a loan on nonaccrual basis 
the bank accounts for loans on a nonaccrual basis when it has serious doubts about the ability to collect principal or interest in full 
generally  the bank s policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan becomes past due days 
loans are also placed on nonaccrual status in cases where management is uncertain whether the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
the bank accrues interest on restructured loans at the restructured rates when management anticipates that no loss of original principal will occur 
potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing and are not included in nonaccrual or restructured loans above  but about which management has serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with present repayment terms 
these loans are likely to be included later in nonaccrual  past due or restructured loans  so they are considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the bank s allowance for loan losses 
at december   the bank had identified  in nonaccrual loans  down from  at the end of real estate owned consists of foreclosed  repossessed and idled properties 
at december  and  there were  and  respectively  in assets classified as real estate owned 
analysis of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
management increases allowance for loan losses by provisions charged to operations and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off 
the allowance is reduced by loans charged off 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly 
in addition  on a quarterly basis our board of directors reviews the loan portfolio  conducts an evaluation of credit quality and reviews the computation of the loan loss allowance 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance  management considers the growth  composition and industry diversification of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  current delinquency levels  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors deriving from the bank s history of operations 
in addition to the bank s history  management also considers the loss experience and allowance levels of other similar banks and the historical experience encountered by our management and senior lending officers prior to joining us 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review allowance for loan losses and may require us to make additions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management 
no regulatory agency asked for a change in our allowance for loan losses during or management uses the risk grading program  as described under asset quality  to facilitate evaluation of 
table of contents probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers and reviewed by credit administration  and tested by the bank s internal auditor 
the testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans  large loans  loans that are identified as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more and still accruing  and nonaccrual loans 
the bank strives to maintain the loan portfolio in accordance with conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the bank s market area 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
the bank has no foreign loans and does not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
management follows a loan review program designed to evaluate the credit risk in our loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  we maintain an internally classified watch list that helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s payment history and the current delinquent status 
as a result of this process  certain loans are categorized as substandard  doubtful or loss and reserves are allocated based on management s judgment and historical experience 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some losses if the deficiencies are not corrected 
a reserve of is generally allocated to these loans 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans that have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable 
a reserve of is generally allocated to loans classified as doubtful 
loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted 
this classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future 
as a practical matter  when loans are identified as loss they are charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the above classification categories  the bank also categorizes loans based upon risk grade and loan type  assigning an allowance allocation based upon each category 
growth in loans outstanding has  throughout the bank s history  been the primary reason for increases in the bank s allowance for loan losses and the resultant provisions for loan losses necessary to provide for those increases 
this growth has been spread among the bank s major loan categories  with the concentrations of major loan categories being relatively consistent from through for the four fiscal years through  the bank s loan loss experience has seen net loan charge offs in each year of range from to of average loans outstanding 
for net charge offs were of average loans outstanding as compared to 
in the prior year 
the bank s allowance for loan losses at december  of million represents of total loans outstanding  excluding loans held for sale 
the bank s allowance for loan losses at december  of million represents of total loans outstanding  excluding loans held for sale 
this decrease in the allowance relative to our gross loans has been significantly impacted by the continued improvement in the credit quality of loans acquired in the acquisition of another financial institution during many of the loans acquired in that business combination had a history of credit issues  which increased the level of the allowance allocated to those loans 
since the business combination  the company has made a concerted effort to readdress the collateral and cash flow requirements for these loans thereby improving their classifications 
this improvement has reduced the level of the allowance necessary for these loans 
management has determined that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business 
the bank makes specific allowances that are allocated to certain individual loans and pools of loans based on risk characteristics  as discussed below 
in addition to the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses  the bank maintains an unallocated portion that is not assigned to any specific category of loans 
this unallocated portion is intended to reserve for the inherent risk in the portfolio and the intrinsic inaccuracies associated with the estimation of the allowance for loan losses and its allocation to specific loan categories 
while management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 

table of contents furthermore  while management believes it has established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing our portfolio  will not require an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses 
no regulatory agency asked for a change in our allowance for loan losses during or in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed herein 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect the bank s and the company s financial condition and results of operations 
bank of north carolina s primary markets  including the counties of davidson  guilford  randolph  forsyth  surry and rowan  have historically been very heavily concentrated in textile  furniture  and heavy manufacturing 
with the competition from overseas  these industries have experienced significant plant closings and layoffs in our markets 
to this point  the retraction in the manufacturing base has had a minimal impact on our loan quality 
however  if this trend continues  it could negatively impact the bank s asset quality 
table following this discussion shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
the allocation is based on an evaluation of defined loan problems  historical ratios of loan losses and other factors that may affect future loan losses in the categories of loans shown 
table following this discussion sets forth for the periods indicated information regarding changes in the bank s allowance for loan losses 
investment activities the bank s portfolio of investment securities  all of which are available for sale  consists primarily of securities issued by local governmental municipalities  us government agency securities  and mortgage backed securities 
securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses reflected as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
securities held for indefinite periods of time include securities that management intends to use as part of its asset liability management strategy and that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates and or significant prepayment risks 
it is the bank s policy to classify all investment securities as available for sale 
table following this discussion summarizes securities available for sale 
table following this discussion summarizes the amortized costs  fair values and weighted average yields of securities available for sale at december   by contractual maturity groups 
the bank does not engage in  nor does it presently intend to engage in  securities trading activities and therefore does not maintain a trading account 
at december   there were no securities of any issuer other than governmental agencies that exceeded of the company s shareholders equity 
sources of funds deposit activities 
the bank provides a range of deposit services  including non interest bearing checking accounts  interest bearing checking and savings accounts  money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
these accounts generally earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management s desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits 
during  the bank had net growth of approximately million in wholesale time deposits 
this compares to million of net growth in with rates at historically low levels  the bank chose to extend the average term of our time deposit portfolio 
in general  investors in the local markets are not interested in time deposits with terms of two years and longer 
the wholesale markets provide a very efficient source of long term funding at rates well below those quoted at the local level 

table of contents borrowings 
borrowings provide an additional source of funding for the bank 
the bank may purchase federal funds through unsecured federal funds guidance lines of credit totaling million at december  these lines are intended for short term borrowings and are subject to restrictions limiting the frequency and terms of advances 
these lines of credit are payable on demand and bear interest based upon the daily federal funds rate 
the bank had no outstanding balance on the line of credit as of december  and as an additional source of borrowings the bank utilizes securities sold under agreements to repurchase  with balances outstanding of million and million at december  and  respectively 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within one day from the transaction date and are collateralized by us government agency obligations 
the bank also uses advances from the fhlb of atlanta under a line of credit equal to of the bank s total assets million at december  
outstanding advances totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
these advances are secured by a blanket floating lien on qualifying first mortgage loans 
a more detailed analysis of the bank s fhlb advances is presented in note f and note g to the consolidated financial statements 
table following this discussion sets forth for the periods indicated the average balances outstanding and average interest rates for each major category of deposits 
table following this discussion sets forth at the dates indicated the amounts and maturities of certificates of deposit with balances of  or more at december  table following this discussion sets forth for the periods indicated information regarding the company s borrowed funds 
market risk market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market price and interest rates 
this risk of loss can be reflected in diminished current market values and or reduced potential net interest income in future periods 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
the structure of our loan and deposit portfolios is such that a significant decline in interest rates may adversely impact net market values and net interest income 
we do not maintain a trading account nor are we subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
interest rate risk is monitored as part of the bank s asset liability management function 
table following this discussion sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are projected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
table following this discussion presents information about the contractual maturities  average interest rates and estimated fair values of our financial instruments that are considered market risk sensitive at december  quarterly financial information table following this discussion sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain of our consolidated quarterly financial information 
this information is derived from our unaudited financial statements  which include  in the opinion of management  all normal recurring adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods

table of contents in december  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for loans or certain debt securities acquired in a transfer 
the sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences relate to a deterioration of credit quality 
the sop also prohibits companies from carrying over or creating a valuation allowance in the initial accounting for loans acquired that meet the scope criteria of the sop 
the sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this sop is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations

critical accounting policy allowance for loan losses 
the company s most significant critical accounting policy is the determination of our allowance for loan losses 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and requires our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
what makes these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex is the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if the mix and amount of future write offs differ significantly from those assumptions we use in making our determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on our income statement could be materially affected 
for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses and a detailed description of the methodology used in determining the adequacy of the allowance  see the sections of this discussion titled asset quality and analysis of allowance for loan losses and note c to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report 
off balance sheet arrangements information about our off balance sheet risk exposure is presented in note p to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities spes  which generally are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   our spe activity is limited to our capital trust subsidiaries bnc bancorp capital trust i  bnc bancorp capital trust ii bnc bancorp capital trust iii  which in aggregate issued  trust preferred securities 
risks associated with the bank and the company concentration of operations 
the bank s operations are concentrated in the piedmont region of north carolina 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the bank s results may correlate to the economic conditions in these areas 
deterioration in economic conditions in any of these market areas  particularly in the industries on which these geographic areas depend  may adversely affect the quality of the bank s loan portfolio and the demand for its products and services  and accordingly  its results of operations 

table of contents risks associated with loans 
a significant source of risk for the bank arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers  guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
the bank has underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan losses  that management believes are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying the bank s loan portfolio 
such policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could adversely affect results of operations 
competition with larger financial institutions 
the banking and financial services business in the bank s market area continues to be a competitive field and is becoming more competitive as a result of changes in regulations  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
it may be difficult to compete effectively in the bank s market  and results of operations could be adversely affected by the nature or pace of change in competition 
the bank competes for loans  deposits and customers with various bank and nonbank financial services providers  many of which are much larger in total assets and capitalization  have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader array of financial services 
trading volume 
the company s common stock is now listed on the nasdaq small cap exchange 
the company s stock was listed on this market during  hoping that this listing would lead to a more active and liquid trading market 
however  the company cannot guarantee that a more active and liquid trading market for the company s common stock will develop in the future 
technological advances 
the banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to improving customer services  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
the bank s future success will depend  in part  on its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in the bank s operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than the company and the bank to invest in technological improvements 
government regulations 
current and future legislation and the policies established by federal and state regulatory authorities will affect the company s and the bank s operations 
the bank is subject to supervision and periodic examination by the fdic and the commissioner 
the company is subject to the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve and the commissioner 
banking regulations  designed primarily for the protection of depositors  may limit the company s and the bank s growth and the return to our shareholders by restricting certain of the company s and the bank s activities  such as the payment of dividends to the company s shareholders  possible mergers with or acquisitions of or by other institutions  investment policies  loans and interest rates on loans  interest rates paid on deposits  expansion of branch offices  and or the possibility to provide or expand securities or trust services 
the company cannot predict what changes  if any  will be made to existing federal and state legislation and regulations or the effect that any changes may have on future business and earnings prospects 
the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements may adversely affect the company s and the bank s ability to operate profitably 
the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act  and the related rules and regulations enacted by the sec  has resulted in a significant increase in audit and legal fees
