overview the stride rite corporation nyse srr is a leading designer and marketer of high quality athletic and casual footwear for children and adults in the united states 
the company was founded in on the strength of the stride rite children s brand  but has since expanded to a portfolio of well known american brands that serve different market segments within the footwear industry 
the company is primarily a wholesaler of footwear  selling its products nationally in a variety of retail formats 
in addition the company also markets its products directly to consumers by selling children s footwear through its stride rite children s shoe stores and all of its brands through its outlet stores 

table of contents the company has developed a long term strategy  which is to be a premier lifestyle company 
we believe that as a unique collection of well known and loved brands  we are positioned to grow within our current sales channels as well as developing sales opportunities in new channels 
we are continually working to expand new product offerings within footwear and beyond footwear through licensing 
if successfully executed  this should lead to sustainable long term growth for the company 
within this overarching strategy  each of our principal brands has integrated strategic operating plans and initiatives 
stride rite children s group is a fully integrated concept that faces several strategic challenges to its business including competition from lower priced products  customers cross shopping various retail formats and a decline in the number of small independent shoe retailers 
stride rite children s group made progress in executing their strategy to increase their market share of the premium non athletic footwear market segments in fiscal year by increasing company owned retail stores while optimizing wholesale distribution channels 
strategic initiatives for fiscal year will be focusing on the continued improvement of our position in the marketplace and to enhance our presence on the selling floor 
we also plan to introduce easy to understand  child friendly product concepts in key categories 
current plans call for the opening of approximately new retail stores during the fiscal year 
keds has been repositioned in to focus on its core products and athletic heritage 
keds has a number of strategic initiatives planned for encompassing brand positioning  consumer demand creation  product strategy  and marketplace management 
the keds strategy relies on building an aspirational brand position 
to personify the aspirational attributes of the brand keds has signed an endorsement contract with the actress mischa barton 
keds is re emphasizing the updated core product platforms by segregating product lines by channel of distribution to meet various consumer needs 
sperry top sider is continuing to successfully implement its core brand strategy to develop and market year round footwear for consumers with great affinity for the water 
sperry intends to build upon their boat shoe product strategy to maintain the brands position as a leading brand of performance boat shoes for men and women and also to influence and broaden the appeal of its casual shoe product offerings 
sperry also plans to increase its share of the women s market 
additionally sperry intends to design and develop innovative performance product for the outdoor and marine channels capitalizing on the brand s heritage and authenticity 
tommy hilfiger footwear had a challenging fiscal year  due to weakness in the men s product 
in fiscal we launched new footwear lines  a junior line under the tommy girl name and in conjunction with the introduction of the h apparel line  a collection of complimentary footwear styles 
the flag products have been repositioned to target the year old consumer 
in the men s product line we intend to develop core products in key athletic and dress casual categories  which should improve sales 
during fiscal year  we licensed the pro keds brand to an independent third party 
we expect that these products will begin to ship in the spring selling season 
in conjunction with a change in strategy of the tommy usa apparel brand  we will be transitioning the tommy h hilfiger product line out of department stores in fiscal the company s international division currently sells its brands in numerous countries around the world  predominantly through distributor and licensing arrangements 
in fiscal year  we intend to add several new distributors in key countries 
due to the abolishment of the quota system on china made goods  an area of primary focus will be western europe 
for  the company based its projections on the continued positive momentum of the stride rite children s and sperry top sider brands  in conjunction with the stabilization of the keds and tommy hilfiger footwear business 
our international performance is expected to remain on trend 
the results of these projections  which may be affected by future performance  are all subject to changes in fashion trends  economic conditions and other risks and uncertainties  which are more fully described elsewhere in this document 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
table of contents generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 
the most significant estimates included in these financial statements include valuation allowances and reserves for accounts receivable  inventory and income taxes 
these areas are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above 
actual results  therefore  could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues consist of sales to customers and royalty income 
wholesale revenues are recognized when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  based on the shipping terms 
retail store revenues are recognized at the time of sale 
royalty income  which accounted for approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  is recognized when earned 
we permit merchandise returns from our customers under certain circumstances and engage in buy down programs with certain retailers  principally in the form of product markdown allowances for obsolete and slow moving products that are in the retailer s inventory 
allowances for markdowns and product returns are estimated and recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
the buy down programs are accounted for as a reduction in revenues 
the returns allowance is recorded as a reduction to revenues for the estimated sales value of the projected merchandise returns and as a reduction in cost of products for the corresponding cost amount 
our procedure for estimating product returns and markdown allowances is based upon our historical experience  product sell through performance by product and by customer  current and historical trends in the footwear industry and changes in demand for our products 
from time to time actual results will vary from the estimates that were previously established 
due to the existence of good monitoring systems  visibility into our customers inventory levels and ongoing communication with our customers  we believe we are able to identify and reflect in our financial statements in a timely manner variances from previously established estimates 
reserve for uncollectable accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
these evaluations  which are performed by our corporate credit department  include  but are not limited to  analyzing our customer s financial statements  maintaining a credit watch list to monitor accounts receivable exposure and reviewing the customer s prior payment history 
we predominantly sell our products to large retailers 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses related to trade receivables 
however  there is a risk that some of these retail customers could experience financial difficulties  particularly in a weak economy  that may cause them to extend payment times or to default on their obligations to us 
if actual losses differ from estimated losses there will be an effect on net income and liquidity 
we believe we have sufficient financial resources and proper tools to mitigate the effect that a large default would have on our ability to continue to operate our business  however  if a large customer were to default on its financial obligation to us  we could experience a decrease in liquidity 
in addition to the impact on liquidity  we could also experience a decrease in future revenues and operating margins related to this loss of business 
inventory reserves the fashion oriented nature of our business  along with the potential for changes in customer preferences and the extended product development lead times  leave us vulnerable to the risk of inventory obsolescence both at our own stores and within our wholesale inventories 
we are also exposed to the risk of inventory markdowns 
table of contents for excess or obsolete products  both at stride rite owned retail stores and from independent retailers 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 
we have continually managed these risks in the past and believe we can successfully manage them in the future 
however  our revenues and operating margins may suffer if we are unable to effectively manage these risks 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated over its estimated useful life 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property and equipment may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine its fair market value and whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the estimate of its fair market value 
any impairment charges are recorded as part of selling and administrative expenses 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about their expected future operating performance 
the estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes in business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 
defined benefit pension plan we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan 
major assumptions used in the accounting for this employee benefit plan include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plan s measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the discount rate was lowered to to better reflect current market conditions 
the expected return on plan assets will remain at in fiscal  reflecting current economic conditions 
pension expense in is expected to increase approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
taxes we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance has not been assigned to our deferred tax assets since we believe it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the benefits of such tax assets 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflects the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to a future valuation allowance 
we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances known at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
this estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the period in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
the preparation of federal and 
table of contents state tax returns requires interpretations  judgments and estimates which are subject to the review and audit of taxing authorities 
we believe that the results of audits will not materially affect earnings 
contingencies the sale of tommy hilfiger branded footwear is a significant portion of our business 
the tommy hilfiger footwear sales are contingent on our licensing agreement with tommy hilfiger licensing  inc during fiscal  we renewed the agreement for an additional term  which will expire in march whether our license with tommy hilfiger will remain in effect depends on our achieving certain minimum sales levels for the licensed products 
we expect to continue to meet the minimum sales levels required by the tommy hilfiger license agreement 
we believe that no provision is currently required for costs related to the potential loss of this license 
if we lose the tommy hilfiger license  our business would be materially and adversely affected

stride rite children s group wholesale stride rite children s group retail stride rite children s group keds tommy hilfiger footwear sperry top sider stride rite international elimination of intercompany sales n a total net sales fiscal year restated for the transfer of tommy hilfiger kids sales from tommy hilfiger to stride rite children s group 

table of contents the fiscal year contained weeks compared to weeks in fiscal the overall retail climate was challenging and inconsistent in in addition  concerns around higher oil prices and global unrest weighed on the consumer  particularly as it affected soft goods sales 
our financial results reflect this difficult business climate 
more specifically  fashion trends continued not to favor canvas and leather sneaker styles  which also weakened our sales results  particularly in our keds and tommy hilfiger brands 
during fiscal  consolidated net sales increased million to million  or above the sales level achieved in fiscal revenues related to the company s wholesale brands decreased million while overall retail sales increased million or when compared to fiscal unit shipments of current line merchandise during fiscal for the company s wholesale brands were below the prior year 
the average first quality wholesale selling price remained flat with fiscal first quality wholesale gross sales decreased by million  or below the wholesale gross sales level achieved in fiscal in addition  closeout sales decreased million from the comparable period in offsetting these decreases was a million increase in the sale of promotional products  a million increase in royalties and a million decrease in returns and allowances compared to the fiscal year 
the decrease in returns and allowances was a result of fewer product conversions and better product performance with our retailers 
this net decrease from wholesale net sales was offset by the strong retail store sales comparisons to last year which resulted in an overall increase of million in consolidated net sales 
the increase in royalty income was primarily the result of the champion footwear license 
the overall increase in net sales of the stride rite children s group was primarily attributable to increased sales from children s group company owned retail stores  which were up from the comparable period last year 
in fiscal  sales to independent retailers remained flat when compared to last year 
during the fourth quarter of wholesale sales increased with the increase primarily attributable to increased sales of promotional and closeout products as well as fewer returns and allowances 
stride rite children s group s wholesale sales have increased over the comparable prior periods during the last three quarters of fiscal we expect that the stride rite children s group wholesale sales will continue this positive trend in sales at comparable children s group retail stores stores open for weeks in each fiscal year increased in fiscal both newer and older stores were responsible for the strong comparable store sales results 
at the end of fiscal  the stride rite children s group operated stores 
this is a net increase of stores  or from the end of fiscal in fiscal  ten children s shoe stores  five outlet stores  seven leased children s shoe departments and two shoe buzz stores were opened and five children s shoe stores were closed 
current plans call for the opening of approximately retail stores and the closing of approximately underperforming stores during the fiscal year 
we anticipate another positive year for the stride rite children s group in the decrease in the sales of keds branded products was primarily the result of weaknesses in the women s fashion styles and grasshoppers product lines  as well as decreased sales of closeouts and promotional products 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the children s product line and a decrease in returns and allowances 
keds closed one retail store in fiscal  with no new store openings  to bring the total keds retail store count to four 
we are currently evaluating the overall performance of these four remaining retail stores and plan to close two stores in no additional keds retail stores are planned to open in the next year 
in december  keds entered into an exclusive worldwide footwear license with the red hat society to manufacture and distribute women s footwear under the grasshoppers line 
in  we are repositioning keds by returning it to its historical position as a sneaker brand with an athletic heritage and targeting the younger consumer with our new brand spokeswoman  mischa barton 
the decrease in the tommy hilfiger footwear net sales can be attributed to declines in the men s athletic and casual businesses  a decrease in the sales of closeouts  as well as an increase in returns and allowances 
the department store channel continues to be challenging due to increased price pressure and the demand for lower 
table of contents priced merchandise 
the introduction of the tommy girl and h hilfiger product lines offset a portion of the sales declines in other components of the tommy hilfiger division 
for  we anticipate improvement in the women s and tommy girl sales and the stabilizing of the tommy men s business in the second half of the year 
in conjunction with a recent change in strategy of the tommy usa apparel brand  we will be transitioning the tommy h hilfiger product line out of department stores in the major contributors to the increase in net sales of sperry top sider products were the strong sales of men s performance boat shoes and casual shoes as well as promotional items 
sales in the outdoor and department store channels also showed growth over closeout sales declined in fiscal as a result of the lower closeout inventory levels due to the strong performance of the overall first quality business 
sales declines in basic boat shoes and canvas casual products offset a portion of the net sales growth 
in  we are projecting continued growth in the men s performance boat shoe category and establishing a stronger spring women s business 
the stride rite international division s net sales growth was the result of the addition of new distributors in asia and the middle east as well as continued strong sales of tommy hilfiger footwear in both asia and latin america 
we anticipate this continued positive momentum in fiscal gross profit in fiscal year  our gross profit of million increased million or above fiscal our gross profit rate of was flat to fiscal the significant factors contributing to the improved gross profit dollars were the additional gross margin related to the higher level of retail sales  which generally produce a higher gross profit margin than the company s wholesale brands  combined with declines in returns and allowances and increased royalties 
offsetting a portion of these increases were the lower gross margin dollars caused by the decline in wholesale sales  certain higher product costs and increased inventory obsolescence costs 
operating costs selling and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million to million or above the expense level incurred in fiscal as a percent of net sales  selling and administrative costs were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to company owned retail store expansion costs  including the addition of stores in and the additional expenses related to compliance with sarbanes oxley requirements 
somewhat offsetting these increased costs were lower bad debt and freight costs 
pension expense of million remained flat to fiscal  although pension expense for fiscal is expected to increase approximately million primarily due to the change in the discount rate 
during fiscal  advertising costs were of net sales versus in fiscal the decrease in advertising was primarily attributable to decreased contractual spending by tommy hilfiger  which is sales based 
operating costs are planned to increase in fiscal due to retail store expansion and advertising costs 
in fiscal year operating costs will also be negatively impacted by the expensing of share based compensation brought about by both the expected adoption in the fiscal fourth quarter of the new accounting standard  sfas no 
r  share based payment  and the decision by the company to issue performance based restricted stock to certain executives in the fiscal first quarter 
other income and taxes non operating income expense increased our pre tax earnings by million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal investment income decreased by million in fiscal comparisons of investment income are negatively impacted by the receipt in fiscal year of million related to stride rite s sale of its interest in a joint venture footwear manufacturing facility as well as a gain on a prior year investment of million 
investment income related to the company s cash equivalents increased million in fiscal due to higher average interest rates 
interest expense  which is related to the revolving credit agreement s facility fee  remained flat in fiscal with fiscal  as there were no short term borrowings during either year 
other expense  net was higher in fiscal due to the performance of a company owned life insurance program as compared to the prior year 
in fiscal  the provision for income taxes increased million due to an increase in pre tax income combined with a higher effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in fiscal versus 
table of contents in fiscal the higher tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due principally to less tax efficient investment vehicles 
the effective income tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal to 
net income we earned million in fiscal  million or above fiscal s net income amount 
the increase in earnings in fiscal resulted from the higher net sales being effected by a flat gross profit percentage 
this was then somewhat offset by higher selling and administrative expenses and a higher effective income tax rate 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales the breakdown of net sales is as follows in millions  except percentages percent change vs 
stride rite children s group wholesale stride rite children s group retail stride rite children s group keds tommy hilfiger footwear sperry top sider stride rite international elimination of intercompany sales n a total net sales fiscal year and restated for the transfer of tommy hilfiger kids from tommy hilfiger to stride rite children s group and pro keds from keds to tommy hilfiger in fiscal year during fiscal  consolidated net sales increased million to million  or above the sales level achieved in fiscal revenues related to the company s wholesale brands increased million while overall retail sales increased million or when compared to fiscal unit shipments of current line merchandise during fiscal for the company s wholesale brands were above the prior year 
the average first quality wholesale selling price declined from fiscal first quality wholesale gross sales decreased by million  or below the wholesale gross sales level achieved in fiscal offsetting this decrease was a million increase in the sale of promotional products  a million increase in closeout sales and a million decrease in returns and allowances compared to the fiscal year  which resulted in the overall increase in wholesale net sales 
this  combined with the strong retail store sales comparisons to fiscal year  contributed to the overall increase of million in consolidated net sales 
the overall increase in net sales of the stride rite children s group was primarily attributable to increased sales from children s group company owned retail stores 
in fiscal  sales to independent retailers decreased when compared to fiscal year this decrease reflects a trend of consistent sales declines in the children s group wholesale sales primarily attributable to the negative impact of the economy on certain licensed partners and trade accounts as well as reductions in sales of the department store channel 
offsetting this decrease were sales levels of children s group s company owned retail stores  which were up from the comparable period in sales at comparable children s group retail stores stores open for weeks in each fiscal year increased in fiscal driving this increase in the comparable stores category was a greater proportion of newer stores that are now included in the computation 
these newer comparable stores generally have had greater comparable sales increases than our more mature stores 
at the end of fiscal  the stride rite children s group operated 
table of contents stores 
this is a net increase of three stores  or from the end of fiscal in fiscal  ten children s shoe stores and one outlet store were opened and five children s shoe stores and three outlet stores were closed 
the decrease in the sales of keds branded products was primarily the result of weaknesses in the women s and children s basic product lines  which were adversely affected by the cold spring  poor economy and a soft canvas sneaker market 
the grasshopper product line was also unfavorably affected  decreasing million or from fiscal also contributing to the decline in keds sales in was the disappointing performance of some new major product offerings and  to a lesser degree  the keds children s line 
somewhat offsetting these decreases was an increase in closeout sales 
keds closed one retail store in fiscal  with no new store openings  to bring the total keds retail store count to five 
in fiscal  the overall tommy hilfiger footwear net sales growth can be attributed to the growth in the independent store channel achieved through the initial sales to large chains in the family footwear category slightly offset by a decline in the department stores 
this increase in tommy hilfiger footwear net sales was the result of growth in the women s outdoor and dress casual styles in independent channels along with a similar growth pattern in the men s dress and athletic styles 
also contributing to the overall increase in tommy hilfiger footwear net sales was an increase of million in the pro keds product line  which remains relatively small 
the major contributors to the increase in net sales of sperry top sider products were strong sales of both men s and women s performance boat shoes as well as promotional items 
sales in the department store and marine outdoor channels showed growth over fiscal the stride rite international division continued to be affected by weakness in the global economy  particularly in south america and the middle east 
this negatively impacted their net sales in fiscal gross profit in fiscal year  our gross profit of million increased million or above fiscal our gross profit rate improved percentage points to as compared to the rate achieved in fiscal the significant factors contributing to the improved gross margin were million in lower closeout  excess inventory and obsolescence costs primarily achieved through improved inventory management  a decline in returns and allowances of million  combined with an additional million in gross margin related to the wholesale retail mix of revenue that was positively impacted by the growth of revenues from our company owned retail stores which have somewhat higher gross profit margin than our wholesale businesses 
operating costs selling and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million to million or above the expense level incurred in fiscal as a percent of sales  selling and administrative costs were in fiscal compared to in fiscal these increases were primarily attributable to increased pension expense of million  increased advertising costs of million and higher retail store expenses of million 
the increase in pension expense was primarily due to investment losses and changes in plan assumptions to the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
during fiscal  advertising costs were of net sales versus in fiscal most of this increase was attributable to increased spending by both keds and sperry 
retail store expenses increased in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the primary cause of this increase was the full year impact of the new children s group stores opened throughout fiscal as well as the addition of stores in fiscal other income and taxes non operating income expense increased our pre tax earnings by million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal investment income increased by million in fiscal  the result of the  gain on the sale of the company s minority interest in the thailand factory joint venture  as well as a 
table of contents gain on a prior year investment  offset by lower investment income 
higher average investments were unable to offset lower average interest rates 
interest expense in fiscal decreased million from fiscal  as there were no short term borrowings during fiscal in fiscal  the provision for income taxes increased million due to an increase in pre tax income combined with a higher effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in fiscal versus in fiscal the higher tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due principally to a lower effective income tax rate which reflected a reduction in previously established tax accruals which were no longer needed 
the company s tax rate reflects the return to more normalized state and federal reserve levels 
net income we earned million in fiscal  million or above fiscal s net income amount 
the higher earnings in fiscal resulted from higher net sales and an increased gross profit percentage somewhat offset by higher selling and administrative expenses and a higher effective income tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  our balance sheet reflected a current ratio of to with no debt 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   a decrease of million from the total cash and cash equivalents of million at the end of fiscal this decrease in our cash balance was primarily the result of the repurchase of common shares as well as an increase in inventory 
during fiscal  our operations generated million of cash  less than the operating cash flows of million in fiscal and million in fiscal our accounts receivable balance of million  decreased million from the year earlier levels 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of shortened average collection times which are reflected in the reduction in our average day s sales outstanding dso 
at december   our dso totaled days  favorable compared to both the dso of days at year end and the dso of days at year end much of this improvement in dso is attributable to more effectively pursuing past due receivables and reductions in customer chargebacks 
year end inventories totaled million  which was million or higher than the million at fiscal year end the inventory increase in fiscal related primarily to the timing of product receipts and the higher number of retail stores 
during fiscal year  our inventory turnover averaged times which compares to a similar turnover rate of times during fiscal and favorably to the lower times realized in fiscal additions to property and equipment totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal this increase in capital spending versus last year is primarily attributable to the higher number of store openings in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal included million related to both new retail stores and the renovation of existing retail locations and million related to information technology and e commerce 
during fiscal we opened children s group retail stores 
in fiscal years and we opened and new retail stores  respectively 
during the fiscal year  our current plans call for the addition of approximately new retail stores 
in fiscal year  we are planning capital expenditures of approximately million 
the opening of new stores  renovation of existing stores  the next phase of a new retail merchandise planning system and increased spending with information technology are the most significant capital expenditure items planned 
funding for our capital expenditures is expected to be provided from internal sources 
if business conditions are not favorable and do not allow for the funding of capital purchases internally  our plans will be re evaluated 
our pension liabilities increased million in fiscal primarily due to declines in interest rates 
these pension liabilities are developed from actuarial calculations and valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions  including discount rates and the expected return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets was developed by examining historical return rates based on the pension plan s asset allocation and considering such factors as return differentials for active investment management 
the expected rate of return remained constant in fiscal at 
due to the long term nature of this assumption  it is not 
table of contents expected that the rate of return percentage will vary yearly 
the expected long term rate of return for fiscal year will be  which is the same rate used in the prior fiscal year 
the discount rate used for the calculation of plan liabilities at fiscal year end was  which is basis points below the rate used in fiscal we consider market conditions  including changes in interest and investment rates  in developing these assumptions 
at fiscal year end  our non cash minimum pension liability totaled million 
this liability was created by the shortfall of plan assets versus the accumulated benefit obligation 
pension expense  a non cash item  for fiscal was million and it is expected to increase in fiscal to approximately million  primarily due to the change in the discount rate 
during the fiscal year  we contributed million to the company s defined benefit pension plan 
current plans for fiscal year anticipate total pension contributions of approximately million 
during fiscal year we returned million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends 
we spent million in fiscal to repurchase approximately million common shares under our share repurchase program 
over the three year period ended december   we repurchased a total of approximately million common shares at an aggregate cost of million 
as of december   we have approximately million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors in june we believe that share repurchases are a good investment and an effective means of providing value to our stockholders 
we will continue to evaluate opportunistic share repurchases during the fiscal year 
we have paid a dividend to our stockholders each quarter since we became a public company in we used million of cash for dividend payments during fiscal  which was a decrease from the million used in fiscal and the million in fiscal due to a lower share number as a result of stock repurchases 
funds for these share repurchases and dividends were provided from internal sources 
under the terms of our revolving credit agreement  we are not allowed to make annual distributions to stockholders in excess of million  however  an amendment was approved by the bank group in allowing a one time increase in the distribution amount to million for the fiscal year 
under the terms of the credit agreement both dividend payments and share repurchases are considered distributions to stockholders 
during the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including the market risk associated with interest rate movements on short term borrowings and cash equivalents 
additionally  economic conditions in countries where we source our products could negatively affect future inventory purchase commitments 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from outside the united states 
as these purchases are primarily denominated in us dollars  we are not directly subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we do not engage in forward foreign exchange and other similar contracts because the associated risk is not considered significant 
if circumstances should change and we conclude that the hedging of foreign exchange risks becomes appropriate  we will begin to do so 
we utilize cash from operations  short term investments and  if necessary  short term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
in addition to internal sources of funding  we maintain a bank line of credit to satisfy the seasonal borrowing requirements that are imposed by the sales patterns that are characteristic of stride rite and of the footwear industry 
due to these seasonal demands  there are times during the year when our cash needs increase 
during fiscal  we entered into a three year  revolving credit agreement with five banks providing for loans of up to million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we renewed this line of credit with substantially the same group of banks through october  we will begin discussions with the bank group during fiscal for the renewal of this credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement requires us to meet certain financial ratios and covenants and to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  we may borrow at interest rates that vary with libor 
in addition  the agreement calls for facility fees of per annum on the committed line 
at year end  we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit line  leaving the entire million available for use 
during fiscal and  we did not make any borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
during fiscal  our borrowings averaged million 
as of december   letters of credit for million were outstanding for the purchase of inventories 
all letters of credit generally expire within one year 

table of contents our significant financial obligations as of december  are as follows cash payments due during the fiscal years in thousands financial obligations thereafter total operating leases we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures 
we utilize cash from operations and short term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
cash balances are normally invested in high grade securities with terms shorter than three months 
due to the short term nature of these investments  changes in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of these financial instruments 
we have available a million unsecured committed revolving line of credit as a source of financing for our working capital requirements 
borrowings under this revolving credit agreement bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus an applicable spread 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in canada 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar  are generally considered long term 
we do not generally hedge these net investments
