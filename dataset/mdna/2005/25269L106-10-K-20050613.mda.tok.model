item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a premier global management consulting firm 
we help leading organizations worldwide to understand and leverage technology to realize value in their businesses 
our firm offers clients skills in strategy  technology  and program management to help companies reduce costs  increase flexibility  address changing regulations and markets  improve operations  and grow their businesses 
we combine innovative strategic thinking  deep industry expertise  and a thorough understanding of technology to deliver results for our clients 
we work collaboratively with our clients  utilizing small  multidisciplinary teams of consultants because we believe the most lasting and significant improvements occur when the client is integrally involved in the change 
during the fiscal year ended march  we generated net revenue of million from clients 
at march   we employed consultants and had eleven offices in north america  europe  south america and the middle east  which included barcelona  chicago  dubai  d sseldorf  lisbon  london  madrid  m nich  paris  s o paulo and washington  dc our revenue is driven by our ability to secure new client engagements  maintain existing client engagements and develop and implement solutions that add value to our clients 
our revenue is comprised of professional fees for services rendered to our clients plus reimbursable expenses 
prior to the commencement of a client engagement  we and our client agree on fees for services based upon the scope of the project  our staffing requirements and the level of client involvement 
we recognize revenue as services are performed in accordance with the terms of the client engagement agreement 
we bill our clients for these services on either a monthly or semi monthly basis in accordance with the terms of the client engagement agreement 
accordingly  we recognize amounts due from our clients as the related services are rendered and revenue is earned even though we may be contractually required to bill for those services at an earlier or later date than the date services are provided 
provisions are made based on our experience for estimated uncollectible amounts 
these provisions  net of write offs of accounts receivable  are reflected in the allowance for doubtful 
table of contents accounts 
we also set aside a portion of the revenue from each client engagement to cover the estimated costs that are likely to be incurred subsequent to targeted project completion 
this portion of the project revenue is reflected in deferred revenue and is calculated based on our historical experience 
while we have been required to make revisions to our clients estimated deliverables and to incur additional project costs in some instances  to date there have been no such revisions that have had a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we have had eight consecutive quarters of net revenue growth resulting from an increase in the demand for our services 
net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year increased compared to the third quarter of fiscal year  and compared to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
for the fiscal year ended march   our net revenue was million  an increase of million  or  compared with the prior year 
we generate revenue in many different countries throughout the world and our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies  including the us dollar  the euro  the british pound sterling and the brazilian real 
as such  our revenues and expenses may be significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
assuming constant foreign currency translation rates  net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year would have increased compared to the third quarter of fiscal year and compared to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
assuming constant foreign currency translation rates  net revenue for the fiscal year ended march  would have increased over fiscal year the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of project personnel costs 
project personnel costs consist of payroll costs  stock based compensation expense related to project personnel  variable incentive compensation  and related benefits associated with professional staff 
other expenses included in project personnel costs are travel  subcontracting fees  third party vendor payments and non billable costs associated with the delivery of services to our clients 
we consider the relationship between net revenue and project personnel costs before reimbursable expenses to be an important measure of our operating performance 
net revenue less project personnel costs before reimbursable expenses  or gross margin  is driven largely by the chargeability of our consultant base  the prices we charge to our clients  project personnel compensation costs  and the level of non billable costs associated with securing new client engagements and developing new service offerings 
to accommodate the growth in the demand for our services  we increased our practice headcount to at march   compared to at december  and at march  our gross margin increased million  or  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
gross margin increased million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year these increases are primarily due to increased headcount  higher realized billing rates and higher utilization of consultants 
our annualized net revenue per practice professional was thousand for fiscal year  compared to thousand for fiscal year our other recurring operating expenses are comprised of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our client serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  management and administrative support  and stock based compensation expense earned by personnel working in these functional areas 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations including finance  information systems  human resources  facilities including the renting of office space  and other administrative support for project personnel 
management believes that income from operations  which is gross margin less other operating expenses is an important measure of our operating performance 
income from operations increased million  or  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
income from operations in fiscal year increased million from a loss of million in fiscal year  to income of million in fiscal year we regularly review our fees for services  professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that our services and compensation are competitive within the industry  and that our overhead costs are balanced with our revenue level 
in addition  we monitor the progress of client projects with client senior management 

table of contents we manage the activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements for new engagements 
however  a rapid decline in the demand for the professional services that we provide could result in lower utilization of our professionals than we planned 
in addition  because most of our client engagements are terminable by our clients without penalty  an unanticipated termination of a client project could require us to maintain underutilized employees 
while professional staff levels must be adjusted to reflect active engagements  we must also maintain a sufficient number of senior professionals to oversee existing client engagements and participate in our sales efforts to secure new client assignments 
our utilization rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year was which was consistent with the third quarter of fiscal year and increased slightly from in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
our utilization rate for fiscal year remained relatively stable at compared to in fiscal year our net cash provided by operations for the fiscal year ended march  was million and included net income of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to an increase in collections and a change in deferred tax assets of million primarily due to the reversal of certain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of million 
management believes that the free cash flow metric  defined as net cash provided by operating activities million net of capital expenditures million  provides a consistent metric from which the performance of the business may be monitored 
free cash flow was million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  disclosure regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act relating to our operations  results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations  estimates and projections 
words such as expects  intends  plans  projects  believes  estimates and similar expressions are used to identify these forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
forward looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate 
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward looking statements 
the reasons for this include changes in general economic and political conditions  including fluctuations in exchange rates  and the following factors our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions  levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our pricing and utilization rates and control our costs 
a continuation of pricing pressures could result in permanent changes in pricing policies and delivery capabilities 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate employees  we will not be able to compete effectively and will not be able to grow our business 
our global operations pose complex management  foreign currency  legal  tax and economic risks  which we may not adequately address 
our engagements with clients may not be profitable 
our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in technology or if growth in the use of technology in business is not as rapid as in the past 
we may face damage to our professional reputation or legal liability if our clients are not satisfied with our services 
the consulting and technology markets are highly competitive 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively if we cannot efficiently respond to market developments in a timely manner 

table of contents our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability will vary from quarter to quarter  which may result in increased volatility of our share price 
for a more detailed discussion of these factors  see exhibit to this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march  we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we earn revenues from a range of consulting services  including helping organizations worldwide to leverage technology to develop and implement growth strategies  improve operations  and capitalize on technology 
our revenues are comprised of professional fees for services rendered to our clients plus reimbursement of out of pocket expenses 
prior to the commencement of a client engagement  we and our client agree on fees for services based upon the scope of the project  our staffing requirements and the level of client involvement 
revenue is recognized over the term of the client engagement in direct proportion to the level of services performed by each member of the engagement team during the period relative to the estimated total level of effort required to perform the project 
therefore  the amount of revenue recognized in a period is for all intents and purposes  equal to the amount that would be recognized based on the stated contract price and the ratio of direct costs incurred in the period to perform the service to the total estimated direct costs of the project 
service revenue recognition inherently involves a degree of estimation 
examples of important estimates in this area include determining the level of effort required to execute the project  calculating costs incurred and assessing our progress toward project completion on an ongoing basis 
we believe that these are critical accounting estimates because they can materially affect our revenues and earnings and require us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain 
we utilize a number of management processes to monitor project performance and revenue recognition including monthly reviews of the progress of each project against plan  staff and resource usage  service quality and client feedback 
from time to time  as part of our normal management process  circumstances are identified that require us to revise our estimates of the timing of revenues to be realized on a project 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects revenue previously recognized  we record the full effect of the revision in the period when the underlying facts become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred revenue we earn our revenues by providing consulting services to clients 
we bill our clients for these services on either a monthly or semi monthly basis in accordance with the terms of the client engagement 
accordingly  we recognize amounts due from our clients as the related services are rendered and revenue is earned even though we may not be able to bill for those services until a later date 
the terms of our client engagements also require us to assume the risk of non collection of amounts billed to clients 
management makes estimates of the amount of our billed and unbilled accounts receivable that may not be collected from clients 
we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it can materially affect our operating results and requires us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain 
in making these estimates  management specifically analyzes individual client balances  the composition of the aging of accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends  and considers our overall experience with estimating uncollectible amounts 
we recognize 
table of contents the effect of changes in our estimates  assumptions and assessments of the factors impacting the collectibility of amounts due from customers on an ongoing basis 
as of march   our accounts receivable balance was million  including unbilled accounts receivable of million  and net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
unbilled receivables represent revenues earned for services performed that have not been billed 
unbilled receivables are typically billed the following month 
although we and our clients agree on the scope of projects  expected deliverables and related fees in advance  from time to time we have made revisions to the scope of work and deliverables without making a corresponding adjustment to the fees for the project 
we refer to this as project run on as these revisions generally cause a project to extend beyond its targeted completion 
we monitor our actual project run on experience on an ongoing basis and perform monthly reviews of projects in progress against plan 
we provide for project run on costs based on our analysis of historical experience 
these provisions  net of actual costs incurred on completed projects  are reflected in deferred revenue 
as of march   our deferred revenue balance was million 
also included in the deferred revenue balance is million of prepaid client fees related to consulting services that the company expects to earn in future periods 
while we have been required to make revisions to our clients estimated deliverables and to incur additional project costs in some instances  to date there have been no such revisions that have had a material adverse effect on our operating results 
operating expenses the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of project personnel costs 
project personnel costs consist of payroll costs  stock based compensation expense related to project personnel  variable incentive compensation  and related benefits associated with professional staff 
other related expenses include travel  subcontracting fees  third party vendor payments and non billable costs associated with the delivery of services to our clients 
the amount of these other direct costs can vary substantially from period to period depending largely on revenue 
however  project personnel and related expenses are relatively stable in nature  and declines in revenue will often result in reduced utilization of professional personnel and lower operating margins 
our other recurring operating expenses are comprised of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our client serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  management and administrative support  and stock based compensation expense earned by personnel working in these functional areas 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations including finance  information systems  facilities including the renting of office space  and other administrative support for project personnel 
in december  september  december and june we recorded restructuring charges related to specific actions we took to better align our cost infrastructure with our near term revenue expectations 
for the december  september and december restructuring charges  we estimated these costs based upon our restructuring plans and accounted for these plans in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
for the june restructuring charge  we estimated these costs based upon our restructuring plan and accounted for this plan in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the restructuring charges and accruals required certain significant estimates of costs related to severance and other personnel related expenses  as well as costs related to reductions in office space and estimated sublease income to be realized in the future  the write off of associated leasehold improvements  and the establishment of accruals for other contractual commitments which are not expected to provide future benefit 
these estimates and assumptions are monitored on at least a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances 
although we do not expect there to be significant changes to our plans  it is reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near term due to unanticipated events  
table of contents resulting in adjustments to the amounts recorded  and the effect could be material 
such revisions will be reflected in the financial statements in the period they occur 
valuation of deferred tax assets in determining our current income tax provision we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
when we maintain deferred tax assets we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax asset to a value we believe will be recoverable by future taxable income 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about the company s future income over the life of the deferred tax asset  and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations 
management s assumptions about future income require significant judgment because actual income has fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so 
in estimating future income  we use our internal operating budgets and long range planning projections 
we develop our budgets and long range projections based on recent results  trends  economic and industry forecasts influencing our performance  our project pipeline  and other appropriate factors 
we have deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in fiscal year and fiscal year  as well as differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their related amounts in the financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against the gross deferred tax assets 
management recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets as of march  largely due to the tax losses we incurred during fiscal years and based on the positive financial performance in the us in fiscal years and  the company reversed million of the valuation allowance as of march  as of march   the remaining valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was million and covered international deferred tax assets  capital loss carryforwards  and certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
the need to maintain a valuation allowance will be reviewed on at least a quarterly basis 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill on april   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets intangibles are no longer subject to amortization  rather  they are subject to an assessment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred  but at least annually  by applying a fair value based test 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level  using a discounted cash flow method 
prior to april   the company amortized goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives not to exceed years  and periodically reviewed the recoverability of these assets based on the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
our goodwill was recognized in connection with acquisitions we made in fiscal and the majority of our goodwill related to our acquisition of cluster telecom bv  a pan european consulting firm specializing in wireless technology and digital strategies  which occurred in november under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s 
table of contents goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test requires our management to make significant judgments  assumptions and estimates 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  the company obtains appraisals from independent valuation firms 
in addition to the use of independent valuation firms  the company performs internal valuation analyses and considers other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows 
this approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and perpetual growth rate  among others 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed our initial impairment review following the guidance in sfas no 
and recorded a million non cash pretax charge for the impairment of goodwill  all of which was generated in the acquisition of cluster telecom bv 
the charge reflected overall market declines since the acquisition was completed in november  was non operational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed the required annual impairment review for goodwill and recorded an additional non cash charge of million  which was recorded as a component of operating income loss in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
this impairment charge was recognized to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at our europe and latin america reporting unit million and our north american reporting unit million 
these charges reflect the units lower than expected performance  including the continued decline in the consulting market  and lower valuations in the consulting industry primarily due to then current market conditions and related competitive pressures 
the impairment charges are non cash in nature and do not affect the company s liquidity 
as a result of the charges recognized during the year ended march   the carrying value of our goodwill was reduced to zero at march  and remained at zero at march  and

we served clients during fiscal year  compared to clients during fiscal year and clients during fiscal year average revenue per client increased to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year these increases reflect the higher realized billing rates and overall expansion in the complexity of and our resource commitment to projects during the past two fiscal years 
revenue from new clients defined as clients that generated revenue in the current period but were absent from the prior period accounted for of revenue during the fiscal year  compared to 
table of contents during fiscal year for fiscal years and  revenue and new client revenue mix by the industries that we serve was as follows new client gross revenue revenue industry financial services telecommunications insurance healthcare enterprise public sector utilities operating expenses project personnel costs project personnel costs before reimbursable expenses increased million  or  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in project personnel costs is primarily due to increases in practice headcount and practice personnel compensation 
also contributing to the increase in project personnel costs is an increase in stock based compensation expense related to stock based awards granted to project personnel during fiscal year as a percentage of net revenue  project personnel costs before reimbursable expenses decreased from during fiscal year to during fiscal year primarily due to an increase in revenues resulting from an increase in clients and higher realized billing rates  which more than offset the increase in compensation costs 
our net revenue per practice professional was thousand for fiscal year  compared to thousand fiscal year project personnel costs before reimbursable expenses decreased million  or  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in project personnel costs during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million decrease in stock based compensation expense for project personnel 
the decrease is due to stock options previously cancelled as a result of forfeitures from terminated employees  resulting in million less expense recorded in fiscal year than fiscal year  an increase in the reversal of previously recognized expense for forfeitures of million in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  and million less amortization recorded in fiscal year than fiscal year due to only a partial year of amortization remaining on some restricted shares 
finally  the decrease in stock based compensation for project personnel is also attributable to the non recurring nature of the million of expense recognized during fiscal year consisting of the remaining unamortized original intrinsic value of certain non vested stock options cancelled by the company on may   pursuant to an offer to employees other than senior officers to surrender certain stock options previously granted to them in exchange for a future grant of new options to purchase the same class of shares 
the remaining decrease in project personnel costs before reimbursable expenses reflects savings resulting from cost reduction programs implemented throughout fiscal year during fiscal year we reduced client serving professionals as part of the company s restructuring plans 
we reduced our client serving professional staff to at march  from at march  as a percentage of net revenue  project personnel costs before reimbursable expenses decreased from during fiscal to during fiscal primarily due to the reduction in our client serving personnel and stock based compensation expenses as previously described 
our net revenue per practice professional was thousand for fiscal year  compared to thousand fiscal year our global utilization rate for fiscal year was compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year utilization decreased slightly in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year due to a decrease in international utilization 
utilization increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due 
table of contents to the overall increase in client projects during fiscal year annualized voluntary attrition decreased to in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year annualized voluntary attrition was for fiscal year total attrition  defined as voluntary attrition plus company initiated attrition  decreased to in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year professional development and recruiting professional development and recruiting expenses increased million  or  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase is primarily due to our increased campus and experienced recruiting initiatives as well as increases in our level of training development and conduct expenditures 
due to the increased demand for our services  we are again recruiting candidates from college campuses 
we are also recruiting non campus hires at all levels 
the costs incurred to recruit consultants include travel and lodging costs for our consultants and recruiting staff  travel expense reimbursements for candidates  and sourcing fees related to non campus hire searches 
as a result of increased headcount  training expenditures have also increased as we have conducted more frequent new hire training programs in fiscal year we have also continued to invest in developing our training curriculum and have increased the number of training courses offered to employees in fiscal year compared to fiscal year marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses increased million  or  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase is primarily due to increases in marketing personnel  increased external consulting fees related to the continued development of our marketing materials and programs  and increased expenditures related to the company s executive learning forums  known as the exchange  due to an increase in the number of events held during fiscal year marketing and sales expenses decreased million  or  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease was the result of reduced marketing activities including the discontinuation of context magazine  the magazine we published from november until december management and administrative support management and administrative support expenses increased million  or  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year management and administrative support expenses included the rent expense associated with our eleven offices located in north america  europe  south america and the middle east 
the increase is primarily due to increases in the costs incurred for third party consulting services related to the sarbanes oxley compliance initiative  stock based compensation expense  and incentive compensation for management and administrative personnel  which were partially offset by a decrease in information technology related depreciation 
management and administrative support expenses decreased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal year the decrease in management and administrative support expense was principally a result of our cost reduction programs implemented in fiscal years and  including the closing of the boston  new york  and san francisco offices and the downsizing of certain offices globally 
also contributing to the decrease in management and administrative support costs during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was a decrease in stock based compensation expense related to stock based awards granted to management and administrative support personnel during fiscal year restructuring charges restructuring charge expense was million during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year during fiscal years  and early  our company suffered from a decrease in global demand as we saw clients decrease their spending on consulting services 
as a result  management implemented plans to restructure the company s operating infrastructure to better align it with the anticipated levels of business during current and future periods 
we recorded four separate restructuring charges during fiscal years   and the primary actions underlying these restructuring charges included 
table of contents facilities downsizing  workforce reduction  and fixed asset write offs 
we expected annualized savings from these charges to be a combined million to million 
refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the activities surrounding each of these restructuring charges 
the company did not have any restructuring activity during fiscal year impairment charge on long lived assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company conducted its annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the carrying value of goodwill to zero 
this impairment charge was recognized to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at our europe and latin america reporting unit million and our north american reporting unit million 
these charges reflected the units lower than expected performance  including the continued decline in the consulting market  and lower valuations in the consulting industry primarily due to then current market conditions and related competitive pressures 
the impairment charges were noncash in nature and did not affect the company s liquidity 
as of march   and  the carrying amount of goodwill was zero 
other income  net other income  net increased million  or  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from a higher cash balance and higher interest rate yields  partially offset by a decrease in foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal year other income  net increased million  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to increased foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal year partially offset by a decrease in interest income as well as the write down of fixed assets in connection with the downsizing of certain european offices 
income tax expense benefit we recorded an income tax benefit in fiscal year of million  compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal year the income tax benefit recorded in fiscal year was principally related to the reversal of the valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets at year end 
the income tax benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income tax expense recorded as a result of income earned in jurisdictions where tax loss carryforwards are limited 
income tax expense decreased million  or  during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the income tax expense recorded in fiscal year was related to the income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in jurisdictions where we do not have tax loss carryforwards 
the income tax expense recorded in fiscal year was principally related to the million increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets recognized by the company 
we have deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in fiscal year and fiscal year  as well as differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their related amounts in the financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against the gross deferred tax assets 
management recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets as of march  largely due to the tax losses we incurred during fiscal years and based on the positive financial performance in the us in fiscal years and  the company reversed million of the valuation allowance as of march  as of march   the remaining valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was million attributable to net operating loss carryforwards in foreign and certain state jurisdictions  as well as us federal capital loss carryforwards 
as of march   the valuation allowance included million which will be credited to additional paid in capital when that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed 

table of contents cumulative effect of change in accounting principle during the quarter ended june   we completed our initial impairment review in accordance with sfas no 
and recorded a million non cash pretax charge for the impairment of goodwill  all of which was generated in the acquisition of cluster telecom bv 
the charge reflected overall market declines since the acquisition was completed in november  and is reflected as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the consolidated financial statements for liquidity and capital resources the following table describes our liquidity and financial position on march  and march  in millions working capital cash and cash equivalents short term investments unutilized bank credit facilities stockholders equity over the past several years  our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and proceeds received upon the exercise of stock options by our employees 
these internal sources of liquidity have been adequate to support our operating and capital expenditure requirements as well as to provide the funding needed for our stock repurchase program 
we anticipate that these sources will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operating and capital requirements at least through fiscal year as a matter of prudent business practice  we also maintain a revolving line of credit pursuant to the terms of a secured credit agreement with a commercial bank under which we may borrow up to million at an annual interest rate based on the prime rate or based on libor plus  at our discretion 
the line of credit is secured by certain accounts receivable of the company s wholly owned subsidiary diamondcluster international north america  inc this line of credit is reduced  as necessary  to account for letters of credit outstanding 
as of march   there were no outstanding borrowings and we had approximately million available under this line of credit 
this line of credit is set to expire on july  while we expect to renew the line of credit agreement on terms similar to those of the existing agreement  we do not rely on our line of credit for liquidity  as evidenced by the fact that we have never borrowed cash against the line of credit  and therefore do not believe that non renewal of the line would have a material adverse effect on our business 
cash flows from operating activities year ended march  in thousands net income total non cash charges tax benefit from employee stock plans total increases in cash flows from operating activities due to changes in assets and liabilities total decreases in cash flows from operating activities due to changes in assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities 
table of contents during the fiscal year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
this primarily resulted from the following activities net income of million  which includes a net non cash benefit aggregating million that must be excluded to arrive at cash flows from operating activities

table of contents treasury stock transactions the board has authorized  from time to time  the repurchase of the company s common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
during the period beginning with the inception of the buy back program in october until the meeting of directors on september   the board had authorized the repurchase of up to six million shares  of which million were subject to repurchase as of september  at the meeting of directors on september   the board restated the aggregate amount of repurchases that could be made under the buy back program to be based on a maximum dollar amount rather than a maximum number of shares 
the authorization approved the repurchase of shares under the buy back program having an aggregate market value of no more than million

as of march   the amount available for repurchase under the board authorization was million

common stock recapitalization on september   the board of directors and shareholders approved a plan of recapitalization  thereby converting all class a and b common stock to a new class of capital stock called common stock  on a one to one basis 
the total authorized number of shares of common stock is  shares 
this plan of recapitalization was based on a detailed review of our system of corporate governance 
the board considered the effect of the sarbanes oxley act and the corporate governance standards being developed for listed companies by the nasdaq national market 
after a thorough review  the board concluded that a modification to the corporation s restated certificate of incorporation and internal governance agreements should be made to assure continued independence of a majority of the board and the proper functioning of the audit and other committees of the board 
because each outstanding share of class b common stock had five votes  the holders of the class b common stock could significantly influence all matters brought to a vote of our stockholders 
in addition  all of the holders of our class b common stock had granted proxies to our chief executive officer to vote their shares 
accordingly  the chief executive officer had the right to vote of the outstanding shares of class b common stock 
our board of directors had determined that it was no longer in our best interest for our chief executive officer to have such voting control 
the board of directors approved this plan of recapitalization in order to bring our system of corporate governance more in line with the governance of other public companies 
implementation of this plan eliminated the voting control then held by our chief executive officer by reducing the number of votes for employee shares and eliminating the ceo proxy  although certain aspects of our internal governance procedures remain under the partners operating agreement  as amended 
on may   we offered employees other than senior officers a plan  approved by the board of directors  which gave employees a choice to surrender certain stock options previously granted to them in exchange for a future grant of a smaller number of new options to purchase the same class of shares  a majority of which would vest over a three year period 
the original options were granted under diamondcluster s stock option plan and under diamondcluster s equity incentive plan 
employees who accepted this offer were required to make an election with respect to all covered options by may  in order to receive the new options  the employees were required to remain employed by diamondcluster until november  the exchange offer was not available to the members of the board of directors or senior officers of diamondcluster 
a total of million stock options were surrendered as part of this plan 
certain 
table of contents of these options had intrinsic value at the original grant date  the unvested portion of which had not been amortized to stock based compensation expense at the date surrendered 
the voluntary surrender of these options resulted in a charge to stock based compensation expense of million during the quarter ended june   relating to the remaining unamortized compensation expense associated with these surrendered options 
on november   approximately million new options were granted to employees who remained employed by diamondcluster 
the exercise price for a majority of the options granted on november  was  or of the fair market value of the company s common stock on that date 
summary we believe that our current cash and short term investment balances  existing lines of credit  and cash flow from existing and future operations will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements at least through fiscal year if necessary  we believe that additional bank credit would be available to fund any additional operating and capital requirements 
in addition  we could consider seeking additional public or private debt or equity financing to fund future growth opportunities 
however  there is no assurance that such financing would be available to us on acceptable terms

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk international revenues are generated primarily from our services in the respective countries by our foreign subsidiaries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country  most of which are the euro 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency  most of which are the euro 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the financial statements of our non us businesses are typically denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary 
as a result  we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates fluctuate  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected results and profitability 
in the past  the company has entered into transactions to reduce the effect of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses on recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  and to reduce the effect of foreign exchange translation gains and losses on the parent company s net investment in its foreign subsidiaries 
these transactions involved the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in certain european currencies 
the company does not use foreign currency contracts for trading purposes 
the company does not currently hedge anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses 
as of march   there were no open forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
diamondcluster has net investments in foreign operations located throughout europe and south america 
in some cases  the company hedges its euro exposures through the use of euro us dollar forward contracts in order to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on the company s financial position 
during fiscal year and as of march   there were no open euro us dollar or other forward contracts outstanding 
interest rate risk the company invests its cash in highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less as well as in other short term debt instruments
