overview with the convergence of it and business  technology has become increasingly more important not just to technology professionals  but also to business executives 
we are an independent and objective research and advisory firm that helps it and business executives use technology to build  guide and grow their enterprises 
we employ a diversified business model that leverages the breadth and depth of our research intellectual capital while enabling us to maintain and grow our market leading position and brand franchise 
our strategy is to align our resources and our infrastructure to leverage that intellectual capital into additional revenue streams through effective packaging  campaigning and cross selling of our products and services 
our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and synergies that facilitate increased client spending on our research  consulting and events 
a key strategy is to increase business volume with our most valuable clients  identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and analysis 
we intend to maintain a balance between pursuing opportunities and applying resources with a strict focus on growing our three core businesses and generating profitability through a streamlined cost structure 
we have three business segments research  consulting and events 
research provides research content and advice for it professionals  technology companies and the investment community in the form of reports and briefings  as well as peer networking services and membership programs designed specifically for cios and other senior executives 
consulting consists primarily of consulting  measurement engagements and strategic advisory services paid one day analyst engagements sas  which provide assessments of cost  performance  efficiency and quality focused on the it industry 
events consists of various symposia  conferences and exhibitions focused on the it industry 
we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments business segment business measurements research contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis 
contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time  without regard to the duration of the contract 
client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time 
client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients  who were also clients a year ago  by all clients from a year ago 

table of contents business segment business measurements wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve month period 
wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients  who were clients one year earlier  by the total contract value from a year earlier 
when wallet retention exceeds client retention  it is an indication of retention of higher spending clients  or increased spending by retained clients  or both 
number of executive program members represents the number of paid participants in executive programs 
consulting consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in process consulting  measurement and strategic advisory services engagements 
utilization rates represent a measure of productivity of our consultants 
utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill 
billing rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours 
events number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period 
number of attendees represents the total number of people who attended events during the period 
announced acquisition of meta group  inc 
on december   we announced an agreement to acquire meta group  inc meta in an all cash transaction for per share  or approximately million  excluding transaction costs 
meta is a publicly owned  premier information technology and research firm based in stamford  connecticut with employees 
in  meta generated million in revenue from worldwide locations and had million of assets at december  meta trades on the nasdaq national market under the symbol metg 
the boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction  and on january   we announced that notice had been received from the federal trade commission of early termination of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act 
meta filed its definitive proxy statement with the sec on february  and is scheduled to hold a special meeting of stockholders to approve the transaction on march  closing of the transaction  which is subject to customary closing conditions  including approval by meta s stockholders  is expected to be effective april  executive summary of operations and financial position during calendar  we have continued to focus on stabilizing and then growing revenue in our core research business 
this continued focus began to yield the desired outcome during the latter half of calendar we ended the latter half of calendar with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in contract value after seven consecutive quarters of sequentially decreasing contract value 
contract value increased sequentially again in the first quarter of calendar  decreased slightly during the second quarter of calendar  and increased sequentially again in both the third and fourth quarters of calendar at december   contract value was million  up from the million at december   with roughly half of the increase due to the effects of foreign currency 
the million contract value represents our highest contract value since the first quarter of calendar our research client retention rate at december  increased to from at the prior year end  while wallet retention increased to from over the same period 
consulting revenue for calendar was flat when compared to calendar  despite the impact of the realignment in which we reduced headcount when we exited certain practices and geographies 
excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rates  revenues would have decreased approximately in calendar compared to calendar our consulting business ended calendar with the continuation of the positive trend that began in calendar  when we ended that year with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in backlog after five consecutive quarters of sequential decreases 
due to the realignment  consulting backlog decreased to million at march   but quickly increased to million at june  and million at september   as business ramped up in our areas of focus 
we ended the year with a backlog of million  a million increase over december  the realignment has also had a positive impact on sub optimal utilization rates and our lack of scale in some regions 
during calendar  our average consultant utilization rates increased to approximately as compared to in the prior year  while billable headcount declined to at december   compared to at december  our events business continues to deliver strong results 
our emphasis on managing the events portfolio to retain our long time successful events and introduce promising new events has resulted in substantially improved overall revenue performance  with calendar revenue up over the prior year  as well as same event revenue  up over the prior year 
we achieved these results while the number of events declined  with held during calendar as compared to held in calendar 
table of contents during calendar  we repurchased a significant number of shares of our class a and class b common stock 
during the first half of calendar  we repurchased  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock at an aggregate cost of million under our stock repurchase program 
during the third quarter of  we completed a dutch auction tender offer in which we repurchased  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock at a purchase price of and per share  respectively 
additionally  we also repurchased  shares of our class a common stock from silver lake partners and certain of its affiliates silver lake at a purchase price of per share 
the total cost of these purchases was million  including transaction costs of million 
in conjunction with the tender offer  our board of directors terminated the stock repurchase program in june in connection with the tender offer  in the third quarter of calendar  we borrowed million under a five year term loan facility  of which million was repaid in the fourth quarter of calendar we also obtained a million  five year revolving credit facility  of which million was available at december  subsequent to december   we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement covenant requirements which resulted in additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
as a result  the amended borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility would have been million at december  at december   we had a cash balance of million compared to million at december  in order to fund the purchase of meta  we anticipate that we will use a combination of cash and our amended five year revolving credit facility 
in connection with funding the meta transaction  the company anticipates repatriating million in cash earnings from its non us subsidiaries in early in february  our board of directors approved the elimination of our classified board structure 
additionally  as previously announced  the board of directors has approved the combination of our class a and class b common stock 
both of these items are subject to stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders to take place in the late spring or early summer of during the fourth quarter of calendar  we made a significant change to our capital structure 
our convertible notes were converted into class a common stock 
this eliminated all of our outstanding debt at that time and the related interest expense 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results our quarterly and annual revenue  operating income  and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors  including the timing of symposia  our flagship event that normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter  and other events  the amount of new business generated  the mix of domestic and international business  changes in market demand for our products and services  changes in foreign currency rates  the timing of the development  introduction and marketing of new products and services  and competition in the industry 
the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period to period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgments and estimates 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  and sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products 
revenues from research products are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term  consulting revenues are based primarily on fixed fees or time and materials for discrete projects 
revenues for such projects are recognized as work is delivered and or services are provided and are evaluated on a contract by contract basis  events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium  conference or exhibition  and other revenues  principally software licensing fees  are recognized when a signed non cancelable software license exists  delivery has occurred  collection is probable  and the fees are fixed or determinable 
revenue from software maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  which is typically twelve months 
the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing  absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time 
all research contracts are non cancelable and non refundable  except for government contracts that have a day cancellation clause  but have not produced material cancellations to date 
it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue  since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 
for those government contracts that permit termination  we bill the client the full amount billable under the contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract 
in addition  we only record deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received 
deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
in addition  at december  and december   we had not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues  relating to government contracts that permit termination  of and million  respectively 

table of contents uncollectible fees receivable provisions for bad debts are recognized as incurred 
the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience  aging of outstanding receivables  an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients 
this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates 
these valuation reserves are periodically re evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available 
circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality  other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due  and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
the following table provides our total fees receivable  along with the related allowance for losses in thousands december  total fees receivable allowance for losses fees receivable  net impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
among other requirements  this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment 
the evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis 
these assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing long term forecasts 
if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we must recognize an impairment charge  for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit  to earnings in our financial statements 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the first quarter relating to goodwill associated with certain operations in south america that were closed  and in the fourth quarter we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to the exit from certain non core product lines 
accounting for income taxes as we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question 
we consider the availability of loss carryforwards  existing deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals we record accruals for severance costs  lease costs associated with excess facilities  contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization  reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs 
estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions  such as future lease payments  sublease income  the fair value of assets  and severance and related benefits  are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated 
to the extent actual costs differ from those estimates  reserve levels may need to be adjusted 
in addition  these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved 
during the fourth quarter of calendar  we revised our previous estimates for costs and losses associated with excess facilities due to declines in market rates for expected sublease income and revised expected periods of sublease 
as a result of these revised estimates  we recorded a charge for excess facilities of million  which was included in other charges along with severance  impairment  and other costs 
additionally  we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year 
amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end 

table of contents impairment of investment securities a charge to earnings is made when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
management regularly reviews each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the valuation of comparable companies and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we own equity securities through two limited partnerships  si venture associates si i and si venture fund ii si ii  which are venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early to mid stage it based or internet enabled companies 
at december   we owned of si i and of si ii 
in the fourth quarter of calendar  we made the decision to liquidate si i and to sell our interest in si ii 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of calendar  we recorded a charge of million related to the liquidation of si i  which included million for the write down of the investment and million in related shutdown charges 
no charges were recorded on si ii in the fourth quarter of calendar related to the planned sale since the carrying value of the investment approximates its net realizable value 
in the third quarter of calendar  we recorded a non cash charge of million related to the transfer of our investment in trusecure to si ii  as well as a decrease in our ownership percentage in si ii of seven hundred basis points 
as a result of this transfer and the decrease in ownership  we were relieved of all future capital calls  which had totaled million 
total investments in equity securities were million at december  and million at december  see note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
change in fiscal year on october   we announced that our board of directors had approved a change of our fiscal year end from september to december  effective january  this change resulted in a three month transitional period ending december  references to transition  unless otherwise indicated  refer to the three month transitional period ended december  references to fiscal and fiscal  unless otherwise indicated  are to the respective fiscal year period from october through september references to calendar  calendar  and calendar  unless otherwise indicated  are to the respective twelve month period from january through december results of operations calendar versus calendar total revenues increased to million during calendar from million during calendar research revenues increased in calendar to million  compared to million in calendar  and comprised approximately of total revenues in both calendar and calendar consulting revenues in calendar of were up slightly compared to the in calendar  and comprised approximately and of total revenues in calendar and calendar  respectively

other charges during the fourth quarter of calendar were million  of which million was for severance and benefits related to a workforce reduction of employees 
we expect additional workforce reductions to occur during the first quarter of calendar which will result in an additional severance and benefits charge estimated at between million and million 
other charges of million during the third quarter of calendar primarily included severance costs associated with the departure of our president and our former ceo of million and million  respectively 
other charges of million during the second quarter of calendar included million of severance costs associated with the departure of our former ceo  as well as million of costs associated with the termination of employees 
during the first quarter of calendar  other charges of million were primarily associated with a realignment of our workforce 
this workforce realignment was a continuation of the action plan initiated during the fourth quarter of calendar and resulted in the termination of employees  or approximately of our workforce  bringing the total terminations associated with the action plan to employees 
we expect payments associated with the workforce reduction to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of calendar we are funding these costs out of existing cash 
for all of calendar  we recorded total charges of million related to the realignment of our workforce  including costs of million related to the departure of our president and our former ceo 
the realignment resulted in the termination of employees for the full year 
the annualized savings from the termination of these employees would be approximately million 
however  we plan to reinvest a significant portion of these savings into improving our products  processes  and infrastructure to help drive future growth 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of calendar  we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded million of additional provisions 
the revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases  as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases 
we also recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of calendar related to the abandonment of certain internal systems  and million for charges related to the exit from certain international and other non core operations

see note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents gain loss on investments  net of million during calendar includes a million insurance recovery received during calendar associated with previously incurred losses arising from the sale of a business 
gain loss on investments  net during calendar also includes an impairment loss of million associated with a minority owned investment not publicly traded 
we evaluated the investment for impairment because of the investee s recapitalization due to its lack of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity  which led us to write the investment down to our estimate of fair value 
the conversion of our outstanding convertible debt to equity during the fourth quarter of decreased our interest expense 
however  due to the new credit agreement signed in the third quarter of  interest expense will increase in the future 
other expense  net for calendar of million includes the non cash write off of million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain of our operations in south america that we have closed 
as a result of this decision we were required to reclassify these currency adjustments that have been accumulated within equity to earnings  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
foreign currency translation 
other income  net for calendar of million consists primarily of net foreign exchange gains 
provision for income taxes was and of income before income taxes for calendar and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for calendar  as compared to that of calendar  reflects the impact of a charge for planned repatriation of foreign earnings in calendar at a one time favorable tax rate pursuant to the jobs creation act of it also reflects the impact of certain non deductible book charges for workforce reductions  excess facilities  asset impairments  and losses on capital investments 
these additional charges are partially offset by the release of valuation allowance on foreign tax credits 
excluding these other charges  the effective tax rate would have been in calendar  as compared to in calendar segment results we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin 
gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  amortization of intangibles  goodwill impairments  and other charges 
gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues 
research research revenues increased when comparing calendar and calendar  but excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates  revenue was flat 
research gross contribution of million for calendar decreased slightly from the million for calendar  while gross contribution margin for calendar decreased to from in the prior year 
the decrease in the gross contribution margin in calendar was primarily due to increased revenues from our executive programs  which have lower margins than our core subscription products  as well as continued investment in our people  products  and processes required to provide research growth 
research contract value  an indicator of future research revenue  was million at december   an increase of from million at december   with roughly half of the increase due to the effects of foreign currency 
the research contract value of million at december  represents our highest reported contract value since the first quarter of calendar during this period  we have been focused on stabilizing and then growing revenue in our core research business 
this continued focus began to yield the desired outcome during the latter half of calendar we ended the latter half of with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in contract value after seven consecutive quarters of sequentially decreasing contract value 
contract value increased sequentially again in the first quarter of calendar  decreased slightly during the second quarter of calendar  and increased sequentially again in both the third and fourth quarters of calendar at december   our client retention rates increased percentage points to as compared to the same measure at december  wallet retention increased percentage points during calendar to 
while wallet retention rates held steady or climbed over the four quarters of calendar  client retention dipped slightly in the first quarter and then climbed for the remainder of the year 
our executive program membership was  at december   up from  at december   which is attributed to new business growth in north america and emea  as well as improved renewal rates 
consulting consulting revenues of for calendar were up slightly when compared to the million in calendar excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rates  revenues would have decreased approximately in calendar compared to calendar adjusted for currency effects  consulting revenue decreased compared to the prior year as a result of our realignment of our business to exit certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies 

table of contents consulting gross contribution of million for calendar increased from the million for calendar  while gross contribution margin for calendar increased to from in the prior year 
the increase in the gross contribution margin was primarily attributable to higher consultant utilization rates  which were approximately during calendar as compared to approximately during calendar  as the effects of the realignment were realized  and the reduction in our billable headcount to at december  as compared to at december   a decrease 
our billable rate was per hour in calendar  a increase from the rate in calendar  which is due to more efficient use of staff globally and a higher billable rate in emea due to the effects of foreign exchange 
consulting backlog increased to million at december   compared to million at december  our consulting business ended calendar with the continuation of the positive trend that began in calendar  when we ended that year with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in backlog after five consecutive quarters of sequential decreases

attendance at events increased to  in calendar from  in calendar  a increase  which is attributed to the popularity of the topics offerred 
gross contribution of million for calendar was higher than the million recorded in calendar as a percentage of revenues  gross contribution increased to during calendar from during calendar the increase in gross contribution margin was due to the mix of events as well as lower personnel and marketing costs

selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  to million during calendar from million during calendar sg a would have decreased by approximately had it not been for the negative effect of foreign currency translation 
the 
table of contents decrease in sg a was primarily the result of lower sales commissions and our continued focus on streamlining our support organizations and restructuring efforts 
depreciation expense for calendar decreased to million  compared to million for calendar the decrease was due to a reduction in capital spending during calendar and calendar relative to the capital spending during fiscal and  which led to a decrease in depreciation expense 
in addition  costs capitalized during fiscal associated with the initial launch of the gartner 
com web site in january have been fully depreciated as of the beginning of calendar amortization of intangibles decreased when comparing calendar to calendar due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized over the past year 
other charges of million during calendar were for costs for employee severance and benefits associated with workforce reductions initiated under two separate actions  million during the first quarter of calendar and million during the fourth quarter of calendar additionally  during the fourth quarter of calendar  we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded million of additional provisions 
the revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases  as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases 
the workforce reduction that occurred during the first quarter of calendar was a continuation of the action taken in transition  which resulted in the termination of employees  or approximately of our workforce 
the purpose of this reduction was to reduce costs in underperforming segments

in addition  approximately million of these charges were associated with our workforce reduction initiated during the first quarter of calendar and were for employee termination severance and benefits 
this workforce reduction resulted in the termination of employees  or approximately of our workforce at that time

gain loss on investments  net during calendar includes a million insurance recovery received during calendar associated with previously incurred losses arising from the sale of a business 
gain loss on investments  net during calendar also includes an impairment loss of million associated with a minority owned investment not publicly traded 
we evaluated the investment for impairment because of the investee s recapitalization due to its lack of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity  which led us to write the investment down to our estimate of fair value 
the loss on investments during calendar was caused primarily by the recognition of impairment losses related to equity securities owned by us through two limited partnerships  si venture associates si i and si venture fund ii si ii 
si i and si ii are venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early to mid stage it based or internet enabled companies

liquidity and capital resources calendar cash provided by operating activities during calendar totaled compared to million in calendar the net decrease in cash flow from operating activities of million was due to several factors 
we paid million in bonuses during compared to zero in calendar no bonuses were paid during calendar as they had previously been paid during the quarter ended december  but are now being paid during the first half of the year as a result of our change in fiscal year that became effective january  as a result  the bonuses were paid in calendar further  we paid a portion of our bonuses in the third quarter of in accordance with the current year corporate bonus plan 
additionally  cash from operating activities declined because we paid approximately million more in severance during calendar than in calendar the net decrease in cash flow from operating activities was also due to the accelerated collection of receivables in calendar which improved operating cash flow in that year by approximately million  which was not repeated in calendar lastly  approximately million of certain accrued liabilities booked in the fourth quarter of calendar were paid in the first quarter of cash used in investing activities increased to million during calendar as compared to million for calendar the increase was primarily due to million we prepaid related to the acquisition of meta

this increase is a result of higher stock option exercises by our employees as increases in our stock price caused a significantly larger percentage of our vested stock options to be in the money during calendar as compared to calendar we borrowed million related to the tender in the third quarter of calendar  receiving proceeds  net of debt issuance costs  of million 
we repaid million of this debt in the fourth quarter of calendar at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
the effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by million during calendar  and was due to the weakening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies  primarily the euro and sterling 
calendar cash provided by operating activities during calendar was million  compared to million during calendar the decrease was primarily due to lower cash related earnings and a smaller decrease in receivables during calendar compared to calendar cash related earnings are income from continuing operations adjusted for the non cash items included in income  such as depreciation and amortization  the accretion of interest and amortization of debt issue costs  along with other non cash charges

obligations and commitments we have a credit agreement that provides for a million term a loan facility and a five year  million revolving credit facility 
during the third quarter of  we borrowed million under the term a loan facility  receiving net proceeds after debt issuance costs of million 
in accordance with the requirements of the term a loan facility  we made a loan payment of million in the fourth quarter of calendar at december   there was million outstanding on the term loan facility and million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
based on specified covenant requirements  our borrowing availability at december  under the revolving credit facility was million 
subsequent to december   we entered into an amendment of the credit agreement covenant requirements that resulted in additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
as a result  the amended borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility would have been million at december  the facilities bear interest equal to libor plus an applicable margin which varies based on specified leverage ratios 
at december   the current interest rate was 
the term a loan facility is payable in equal quarterly installments over a five year period ending august  the credit facilities are subject to mandatory prepayments from a portion of proceeds from asset sales and proceeds from certain future debt issuances 
the credit agreement includes customary affirmative  negative and financial covenants primarily based on our financial results and other measures such as contract value

while subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals  we expect the transaction to be effective april  the million of meta acquisition obligation in the table above relates to additional nonrefundable acquisition expenses that we are obligated to pay 
in order to fund the purchase of meta  we anticipate that we will use a combination of cash and our amended five year revolving credit facility 
in connection with funding the meta transaction  we anticipate repatriating million in cash earnings from our non us subsidiaries in early we believe that our existing cash balances  together with cash from our operating activities and the additional borrowing capacity under our amended five year revolving credit facility  will be sufficient for our expected short term and foreseeable long term needs 
we are currently evaluating the option of establishing long term debt as a permanent part of our capital structure 
however  there can be no assurances that such capital will be available to us or will be available on commercially reasonable terms

table of contents factors that may affect future performance we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
in addition  we and our clients are affected by the economy 
the following section discusses many  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties 
economic conditions 
our revenues and results of operations are influenced by economic conditions in general and more particularly by business conditions in the it industry 
a general economic downturn or recession  anywhere in the world  could negatively affect demand for our products and services and may further substantially reduce existing and potential client information technology related budgets 
the economic downturn in the united states and globally has led to constrained it spending  which has impacted our business and if it were to continue could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  including the ability to maintain client retention  wallet retention and consulting utilization rates  and achieve contract value and consulting backlog 
to the extent our clients are in the it industry  the severe decline in that sector has also had a significant impact on their spending 
organizational and product integration related to acquisitions 
we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products and services  including our pending acquisition of meta 
the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition  dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital  increased indebtedness  the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks  the ability to integrate successfully the operations and personnel of the acquired business  the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company  the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired company  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business 
the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business 
restructuring  reorganization and management team 
our future success depends  in significant part  upon the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel 
we have recently reorganized our business around specific client needs 
as part of this reorganization  a number of key management positions have been filled by the promotion of current employees or the hiring of new employees 
additionally  we have restructured our workforce in order to streamline operations and strengthen key consulting practices 
if the reorganization and restructuring of our business does not lead to the results we expect  our ability to effectively deliver our products  manage our company and carry out our business plan may be impaired 
on july   we announced that the board of directors named eugene a 
hall as our chief executive officer 
mr 
hall succeeded michael fleisher  who had previously announced his intention to depart as our chairman and chief executive officer 
additionally  james c 
smith  a current board member  has been named non executive chairman of the board of directors 
further  on september   we announced that the position of president and chief operating officer  previously held by maureen o connell  was eliminated and that mr 
hall would assume direct responsibility for business operations 
if we cannot successfully integrate our chief executive officer into our senior management team  then our ability to effectively deliver our products  manage our company and carry out our business plan may be impaired 
acts of terrorism or war 
acts of terrorism  acts of war and other unforeseen events  may cause damage or disruption to our properties  business  employees  suppliers  distributors and clients  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
such events may also result in an economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
competitive environment 
we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services  including information that can be found on the internet free of charge 
we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers  including electronic and print media companies  some of which may have greater financial  information gathering and marketing resources than we do 
these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future 
in addition  limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business 
as a result  additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services 
additionally  technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 
increased competition may result in loss of market share  diminished value in our products and services  reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures 
we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis  timely delivery of information  customer service  the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis  or price 
renewal of research business by existing clients 
some of our success depends on renewals of our subscription based research products and services  which constituted of our revenues for calendar and calendar these research subscription agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months 
our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors  including those described in this annual report 
additionally  as we implement our strategy to realign our business to client needs  we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates 
while client retention rates were at december  and at december   there can be no guarantee that we will continue to have this level of client renewals 
any material decline in renewal rates could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 
non recurring consulting engagements 
consulting segment revenues constituted of our revenues for calendar and of our revenues for calendar these consulting engagements typically are project based and non recurring 
our ability to replace 
table of contents consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors  including those described in this annual report 
any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 
hiring and retention of employees 
our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management  research analysts  consultants  sales and other key personnel 
we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from  among others  technology companies  market research firms  consulting firms  financial services companies and electronic and print media companies  some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals 
some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to non compete agreements that could impede our short term recruitment efforts 
any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business  could adversely affect the quality of our products and services  and therefore  our future business and operating results 
maintenance of existing products and services 
we operate in a rapidly evolving market  and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients 
any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results 
further  if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research  our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline 
in addition  we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a cost effective manner 
failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 
introduction of new products and services 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis 
to maintain our competitive position  we must continue to enhance and improve our products and services  develop or acquire new products and services in a timely manner  and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them 
any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial position 
international operations 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of north america  for calendar as a result  our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities  including general political and economic conditions in each country  changes in market demand as a result of exchange rate fluctuations and tariffs and other trade barriers  challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations  different or overlapping tax structures  higher levels of united states taxation on foreign income  and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements  collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions 
we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations 
if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us  we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis 
additionally  clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 
branding 
we believe that our gartner brand is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases 
we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget  hire additional marketing and public relations personnel  expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty 
if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand  or incur excessive expenses in doing so  our future business and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 
indebtedness 
we have a million senior revolving credit facility as well as a million revolving credit facility 
the affirmative  negative and financial covenants of the credit facility could limit our future financial flexibility 
as a result of these covenants  our borrowing availability at december  was million  and would have been million based on an amendment to the credit agreement 
the associated debt service costs of these facilities could impair our future operating results 
the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us  which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services  respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark  trade secret  confidentiality  non compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary 
our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us 
the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
accordingly  we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
our employees are subject to non compete agreements 
when the non competition period expires  former employees may compete against us 
if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the non competition period  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to enforce the non compete provision 
possibility of infringement claims 
third parties may assert infringement claims against us 
regardless of the merits  responding to any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may 
table of contents not be offered or available on reasonable terms 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
our quarterly and annual operating income may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  including the timing of the execution of research contracts  which typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter  the extent of completion of consulting engagements  the timing of symposia and other events  which also occur to a greater extent in the fourth calendar quarter  the amount of new business generated  the mix of domestic and international business  changes in market demand for our products and services  the timing of the development  introduction and marketing of new products and services  and competition in the industry 
an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow  and achieve our forecasts  may impact our operating and other activities 
the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period to period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 
significant stockholders 
silver lake and its affiliates own approximately of our class a common stock and approximately of our total common stock on a combined basis as of february  currently  the owners of our class a common stock are only entitled to vote for two of the ten members of our board of directors and vote together with the holders of the class b common stock as a single class on all other matters coming before the stockholders 
silver lake is restricted from purchasing additional stock without our consent pursuant to the terms of a securityholders agreement 
this securityholders agreement also provides that we cannot take certain actions  including acquisitions and sales of stock and or assets without silver lake s consent 
additionally  valueact partners and its affiliates own approximately of our class a common stock  of our class b common stock and of our total common stock on a combined basis as of february  while neither silver lake nor valueact holds a majority of our outstanding shares  they may be able  either individually or together  to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers  consolidations and sales of our assets 
their interests may differ from the interests of other stockholders 
anti takeover protections 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors 
these provisions include the presence of a classified board of directors  the existence of two classes of common stock with our class b common stock having the ability to elect of our board of directors  the ability of our board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock  advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings  a preferred shares rights agreement  and the anti takeover provisions of delaware law 
these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock 
we have announced that we intend to eliminate our classified board structure and combine our two classes of common stock  subject to the approval of our stockholders  at our next annual meeting of stockholders to be held in the late spring or early summer of these actions could serve to make it easier for a change of control to occur 
non cash compensation charges in future periods 
on october   we announced that eugene a 
hall received an inducement grant of  shares of restricted stock with a market value on the date of grant of per share 
as long as mr 
hall remains an employee  the restriction on the  shares of restricted stock will lapse upon the earlier of a our day average stock price meeting certain targets  or b a change in control 
the price targets are for the first  shares  for the next  shares and for the remaining  shares 
if our day average stock price exceeds the stipulated per share target during the day measurement period  we will be required to record a non cash compensation charge equal to the closing price of our stock on the date the target is met times the number of shares associated with the applicable target 
for example  if our average days stock price is per share and the stock closes at per share  the first lapse shall result in us recording a million non cash compensation charge  shares at share 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payments sfas r 
the rule replaces sfas no 
and apb and will require the recognition of expense for share based payments  to include the value of stock options granted to employees 
the revised rule is effective for periods beginning after june   but early adoption is permitted 
we plan to adopt the new rule on july  we are currently assessing the impact the revised rule will have on our financial position  cash flows  and results of operations  but we believe it may have a material effect on our results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates since we had million drawn on our unsecured senior revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank 
under the revolving credit facility  the interest rate on borrowings is libor plus an additional to basis points based on our debt to ebitda ratio 
however  we believe that an increase or decrease of in the effective interest rate on available borrowings from our senior revolving credit facility would not have a material effect on our future results of operations 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an approximate million annual effect under the revolving credit facility when fully utilized 
investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our equity investments 
we invest in equity securities of public and private companies directly and through si ii  of which we own at december  si ii is engaged in making venture capital investments in early to mid stage it based or internet enabled companies see note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had investments in equity securities totaling million 
these investments are inherently risky as the businesses are typically in early development stages and may never develop 
further  certain of these investments are in publicly traded companies whose shares are subject to significant market price volatility 
adverse changes in market conditions and poor operating results of the underlying investments may result in us incurring additional losses or an inability to recover the original carrying value of our investments 
if there were a adverse change in the value of our equity portfolio as of december   this would result in a non cash impairment charge of million 
we had no additional commitments to fund si ii as of december  foreign currency exchange risk we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and transaction risk 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the united states dollar 
since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries  the foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders equity and do not impact operating results 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations 
currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included within other income expense  net within the consolidated statements of operations 
currency transaction gains losses  net were million during calendar  million during calendar  million during calendar  million during transition  and million during fiscal from time to time we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign exchange forward contracts are reflected at fair value with gains and losses recorded in earnings 
at december   we had no foreign currency forward contracts or other derivative financial instruments outstanding
