the company can give no assurances that the assumptions upon which such forward looking statements are based will prove to be correct 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are included throughout this document 
the cautionary statements expressly qualify all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on the company s behalf 
internal control systems 
there are inherent limitations in all control systems  and misstatements due to error or fraud that could seriously harm our business may occur and not be detected 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
in addition  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  in our company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
further  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more persons 
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
a failure of our controls and procedures to detect error or fraud could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
competition 
the company competes with numerous other companies in virtually all facets of its business 
the competitors in development  exploration  acquisitions and production include major integrated oil 
table of contents and gas companies as well as numerous independents  including many that have significantly greater resources 
therefore  competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases and evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than the financial or personnel resources of the company permit 
the ability of the company to increase reserves in the future will be dependent on its ability to select and acquire suitable prospects for future exploration and development 
historically  the company s projects have been financed through debt and internally generated cash flow 
there is competition for capital to finance oil and gas drilling 
the ability of the company to obtain such financing is uncertain and can be affected by numerous factors beyond its control 
the inability of the company to raise capital in the future could have an adverse effect its financial condition and results of operations 
marketing of oil and natural gas 
the ability to market oil and natural gas depends on numerous factors beyond the company s control 
these factors include the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas  the availability of pipeline capacity  the effects of inclement weather  the demand for oil and natural gas by utilities and other end users  the availability of alternative fuel sources  the proximity of natural gas production to natural gas pipelines  state and federal regulations of oil and natural gas marketing  and federal regulation of natural gas sold or transported in interstate commerce 
because of these factors  the company may be unable to market all of the oil and natural gas that it produces  including oil and natural gas that may be produced from the bohai bay properties 
in addition  the company may be unable to obtain favorable prices for the oil and natural gas it produces 
volatility of oil and gas prices 
prices for oil and gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the company s control 
these factors include but are not limited to weather conditions in the united states  the condition of the united states economy  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  governmental regulation  political stability in the middle east and elsewhere  the foreign supply of oil and gas  the price of foreign oil and gas imports and the availability of alternate fuel sources and transportation interruption 
any substantial and extended decline in the price of oil or gas could have an adverse effect on the carrying value of the company s proved reserves  borrowing capacity  the company s ability to obtain additional capital  and the company s revenues  profitability and cash flows from operations 
volatile oil and gas prices make it difficult to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and divestiture and often cause disruption in the market for oil and gas producing properties  as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value 
price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation projects 
price of wyoming production 
the company produces natural gas in wyoming 
the market price for this natural gas differs from the market indices for natural gas in the gulf coast region of the united states due potentially to insufficient pipeline capacity and or low demand in the summer months for natural gas in the rocky mountain region of the united states 
therefore  the effect of a price decrease may more adversely affect the price received for the company s wyoming production than production in the other us regions 
government regulations 
the company s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require that the company acquire permits before commencing drilling  restrict the substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas  require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as plugging abandoned wells  and require governmental approval of the overall development plan prior to the start of development of fields in china 

table of contents under these laws and regulations  the company could be liable for personal injury and clean up costs and other environmental and property damages  as well as administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
the company maintains limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages  but does not maintain insurance coverage for the full potential liability that could be caused by sudden and accidental environmental damages 
accordingly  the company may be subject to liability or may be required to cease production from properties in the event of environmental damages 
a significant percentage of the company s united states operations are conducted on federal lands 
these operations are subject to a variety of on site security regulations as well as other permits and authorizations issued by the blm  the wyoming department of environmental quality and other agencies 
a portion of the company s acreage is affected by winter lease stipulations that prohibit exploration  drilling and completing activities generally from november to april  but allow production activities all year round 
to drill wells in wyoming  the company is required to file an application for permit to drill with the wyoming oil and gas conservation commission 
drilling on acreage controlled by the federal government requires the filing of a similar application with the blm 
these permitting requirements may adversely affect the company s ability to complete its drilling program at the cost and in the time period currently anticipated 
on large scale projects  lessees may be required to perform environmental impact statements to assess the environmental impact of potential development  which can delay project implementation and or result in the imposition of the environmental restrictions that could have a material impact on cost or scope 
limited financial resources 
the company s ability to continue exploration and development of its properties and to replace reserves may be dependent upon its ability to continue to raise significant additional financing  including debt financing that may be significant  or obtain some other arrangements with industry partners in lieu of raising financing 
any arrangements that may be entered into could be expensive to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital in light of factors such as the market demand for its securities  the state of financial markets for independent oil companies including the markets for debt  oil and gas prices and general market conditions 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of the company s capital budget 
the company expects to continue using its bank credit facility to borrow funds to supplement its available cash flow 
the amount the company may borrow under the credit facility may not exceed a borrowing base determined by the lenders based on their projections of the company s future production  future production costs and taxes  commodity prices and other factors 
the company cannot control the assumptions the lenders use to calculate the borrowing base 
the lenders may  without the company s consent  adjust the borrowing base at any time 
if the company s borrowings under the credit facility exceed the borrowing base  the lenders may require that the company repay the excess 
if this were to occur  the company may have to sell assets or seek financing from other sources 
the company can make no assurances that it would be successful in selling assets or arranging substitute financing 
for a description of the bank credit facility and its principal terms and conditions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
interruptions from severe weather 
the company s operations are conducted principally in the rocky mountain region 
the weather in this area can be extreme and can cause interruption in the company s exploration and production operations 
moreover  especially severe weather can result in damage to facilities entailing longer operational interruptions and significant capital investment 
likewise  the company s rocky mountain operations are subject to disruption from winter storms and severe cold  which can limit operations involving fluids and impair access to the company s facilities 
a portion of the company s acreage is affected by winter lease stipulations that restrict the period of time during which operations may be conducted on the leases 
the company s leases that are affected by the winter stipulations prohibit drilling and completing activities from mid november to mid may  but allow production activities all year round 
the company invests heavily in exploration 
the company has historically invested a significant portion of its capital budget in drilling exploratory wells in search of unproved oil and gas reserves 
the company cannot be certain that the exploratory wells it drills will be productive or that it will recover all or any portion of its investments 
in order to increase the chances for exploratory success  the company often invests in seismic or other geoscience data to assist it in identifying potential drilling objectives 
additionally  the cost of drilling  completing and testing exploratory wells is often uncertain at the time of the company s initial investment 
depending on complications encountered while drilling  the final cost of the well may significantly exceed that which the company originally estimated 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration 
table of contents and development activities as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec 
under this method of accounting  the costs of unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment and are then depleted using the unit of production method based on the company s proved reserves 
replacement of reserves 
the company s future success may depend on its ability to find  develop and acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
without successful exploration  development or acquisition activities  the company s reserves and production will decline 
the company can give no assurance that it will be able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves at acceptable costs 
operating hazards and uninsured risks 
the oil and gas business involves a variety of operating risks  including fire  explosion  pipe failure  casing collapse  abnormally pressured formations  and environmental hazards such as oil spills  gas leaks  and discharges of toxic gases 
the occurrence of any of these events with respect to any property operated or owned in whole or in part by the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company and the operators of its properties maintain insurance in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be reasonable 
however  insurance coverage is not always economically feasible and is not obtained to cover all types of operational risks 
the occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
drilling and operating risks 
the company s oil and gas operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with drilling for  and production and transportation of  oil and gas 
these risks include the necessity of spending large amounts of money for identification and acquisition of properties and for drilling and completion of wells 
in the drilling of exploratory or development wells  failures and losses may occur before any deposits of oil or gas are found 
the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations  blow outs or accidents may cause such activity to be unsuccessful  resulting in a loss of the company s investment in such activity 
if oil or gas is encountered  there can be no assurance that it can be produced in quantities sufficient to justify the cost of continuing such operations or that it can be marketed satisfactorily 
drilling plans subject to change 
this report includes certain descriptions of the company s future drilling plans with respect to its prospects 
a prospect is an area which the company s geoscientists have identified what they believe  based on available seismic and geological information  to be indications of hydrocarbons 
the company s prospects are in various stages of review 
whether or not the company ultimately drills a prospect may depend on the following factors receipt of additional seismic data or reprocessing of existing data  material changes in oil or gas prices  the costs and availability of drilling equipment  success or failure of wells drilled in similar formations or which would use the same production facilities  availability and cost of capital  changes in the estimates of costs to drill or complete wells  the approval of partners to participate in the drilling or  in the case of cnooc  approval of expenditures for budget purposes  the company s ability to attract other industry partners to acquire a portion of the working interest to reduce exposure to costs and drilling risks  decisions of the company s joint working interest owners  and the blm s interpretation of the eis and the results of the permitting process 
the company will continue to gather data about its prospects  and it is possible that additional information may cause the company to alter its drilling schedule or determine that a prospect should not be pursued at all 
financial reporting impact of full cost method of accounting 
the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
a separate cost center is maintained for expenditures applicable to each country in which the company conducts exploration and or production activities 
under such method  the net book value of properties on a country by country basis  less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed a calculated ceiling 
the ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties  discounted at per year 
in calculating discounted future net revenues  oil and gas prices in effect at the time of the calculation are held constant  except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts 
the net book value is compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis 
the excess  if any  of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense 
under sec full cost accounting rules  any write off recorded may not be reversed even if higher oil and gas prices increase the ceiling applicable to future periods 
future price decreases could result in reductions in the carrying value of such assets and an equivalent charge to earnings 
risks arising from being non operator in bohai bay 
because the company is not the operator and holds a minority interest it cannot control the pace of exploration or development in the bohai bay properties or major decisions affecting drilling of wells or the plan for development and production  although contract 
table of contents provisions give the company certain consent rights in some matters 
kerr mcgee s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which the company spends money on this project 
if kerr mcgee were to shift its focus from this project  the pace of development of the blocks could slow down or stop altogether 
the company currently does not believe it has sufficient funds to purchase kerr mcgee s interests in these blocks if they were offered 
on the other hand  if kerr mcgee were to decide to accelerate development of this project  the company could be required to fund its share of costs at a faster pace than anticipated  which might exceed its ability to raise funds 
if  because of this  the company were unable to pay its share of costs  it could lose or be forced to sell its interest in the bohai bay properties or be forced to not participate in the exploration or development of specific prospects or fields on the blocks  potentially diminishing the value of its bohai bay assets 
political  economic or international factors affecting china 
ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the united states are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of expropriation  nationalization  war or insurrections  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies  change in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  labor problems  other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over its international operations  and currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations 
tensions between china and its neighbors or various western countries  regional political or military disruption  changes in internal chinese leadership  social or political disruptions within china  a downturn in the chinese economy  or a change in chinese laws or attitudes toward foreign investment could make china an unfavorable environment in which to invest 
although all the foreign interest owners in the bohai bay properties have the right to sell production in the world market  the regulation of the concession by china  and the likely participation by cnooc as a large working interest owner  make chinese internal and external affairs important to the investment in the bohai bay 
if any of these negative events were to occur  it could lead to a decision that there is an intolerable level of risk in continuing with the investment  or the company may be unable to attract equity investors or lenders  or satisfy any then existing lenders 
in the event of a dispute arising from foreign operations  the company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states or a potentially more favorable country 
in addition  the company s china pscs terminate after years of production  unless extended as provided for  which may be prior to the end of the productive life of the fields 
operating risks in china 
offshore operations  such as the company s bohai bay properties  are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment  such as capsizing  collisions and or loss from storms or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
as a result  the company could incur substantial liabilities that could result in financial losses or failures 
china has many regulations similar to those addressed in item i  environmental regulation  that may expose the company to liability 
offshore projects  like the china field developments  are typically large  complex construction projects that are potentially subject to delays which may cause delays in achieving production and profitability 
item properties 
location and characteristics the company is dependent on oil and gas leases in wyoming and two petroleum contracts in china in order to explore for and produce oil and gas 
the leases in wyoming are primarily federal leases with year lease terms until establishment of production 
production on the lease extends the lease terms until cessation of that production 
there are approximately  gross  net acres currently held by production 
the china petroleum contracts are for a maximum of years and are divided into periods  exploration  development and production 
the exploration period is for approximately years and work is to be performed and expenditures are to be incurred to delineate the extent and amount of hydrocarbons  if any  for each block 

table of contents the development period occurs when a field is discovered and commences on the date of approval of the ministry of energy 
there is no limit on the time allowed to develop a field 
the production period of any oil and gas field in a block is a period of consecutive years commencing on the date of commencement of commercial production from the field  unless extended

the field currently consists of two production platforms and an anchored fpso vessel 
during start up of the initial phase development in  the company participated in drilling gross net oil producers and gross net water injection wells into the primary producing horizons of the upper and lower minghuazhen  guantao and dongying formations 
at completion of phase of the development in early  as many as wells may have been drilled in the two fields 
under the psc  the company is responsible for of all expenses incurred on any portion of the blocks not declared as development areas exploration interest 
upon declaration of commerciality of a field 
table of contents or area by cnooc  the company s share of all expenses within that area is decreased by  with the participation by cnooc  to development interest 
upon initiation of production  the sharing of production is determined by the language of the psc which in general terms states that for each individual field a chinese national industrial tax vat and royalty are applied to of the gross volumes of oil  lease operating expenses loe are then taken out of the remainder oil and after these deductions  of the remaining production stream is dedicated to exploration and development cost recovery for the participants 
the exploration cost recovery shall be recovered without interest  while the development cost recovery shall be calculated with a fixed annual interest rate of nine percent uplift  and the remaining of production goes to the remainder oil category which is divided into a share oil for cnooc and an allocable remainder oil for the contractors determined by a sliding scale determined by yearly production x factor 
project profit is subject to chinese corporate tax 
on october   a year contract which provides for extensions for up to an additional years was signed by the operator to lease the fpso 
the company ratified the contract for its net share which is 
the fpso is a  dead weight tons dwt  double hull fpso with a  barrels storage capacity  with single point mooring spm and a processing plant capable of processing  barrels oil day expandable to  barrels oil day 
the fpso service agreement calls for a day rate lease payment and a sliding scale per barrel payment that decreases based on cumulative barrels processed

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the financial condition and operating results of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the company 
except as otherwise indicated all amounts are expressed in us dollars 
we operate in one segment  natural gas and oil exploration and development with two geographical segments  the united states and china 
the company currently generates the majority of its revenue  earnings and cash flow from the production and sales of natural gas and oil from its property in southwestern wyoming 
the price of natural gas in the southwest wyoming region is a critical factor to the company s business 
the price of gas in southwest wyoming historically has been volatile 
the average annual realizations for the period have ranged from to per mcf 
this volatility could be very detrimental to the company s financial performance 
the company seeks to limit the impact of this volatility on its results by entering into forward sales and derivative contracts for gas in southwest wyoming 
the average realization for the company s gas during calendar was per mcf  basis opal  wyoming  including the effect of hedges 
for the quarter ended december   the average realization for the company s gas was per mcf  basis opal  wyoming  including the effect of hedges 
on july  the company initiated production at the first two fields of the nine fields discovered on its oil properties offshore bohai bay  china 
production from these fields is characterized as a heavy  sweet crude 
the company sold its first cargos of oil in september at that time  the price of oil in east asia became much more relevant to the company 
during the twelve month period ended december   the company sold  barrels of its chinese oil production at a price based on the official icp posting for duri field crude  less a discount for location and quality differences 
these sales were made to an affiliate of cnooc  ltd  the company s chinese partner  at an average price of usd per barrel 
for the quarter ended december   the company sold  barrels of its chinese crude for an average price of 
there can and will be differences in timing between the sale of the company s crude oil cargos and the company s pro rata share of production 
as of february   the duri price was approximately usd before discount per barrel 
the company expects to sell at least one cargo of its chinese crude oil production approximately every two months during the company has the right to export and sell its crude at market prices into the international markets  and is evaluating options to do so in the future 
other markets for the company s chinese oil may be potentially developed in south korea  japan  singapore or other countries 
the company has grown its natural gas and oil production significantly over the past four years and management believes it has the ability to continue growing production by drilling already identified locations on its leases in wyoming and by bringing into production the already discovered oil fields in china 
the company delivered production growth on an mcfe basis during the quarter ended december  as compared to the same quarter in and for the year ended december  compared to the same period in management expects to deliver additional production growth during by drilling and bringing into production additional wells in wyoming and bringing into production the next two fields in china 
production bcfe the company conducts operations in both the united states and china 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which the company has operations 
substantially all of the oil and gas activities are conducted jointly with others and  accordingly  the amounts reflect only the company s proportionate interest in such activities 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in addition  application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
changes in these estimates  judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and  accordingly  actual results could differ from amounts estimated 

table of contents use of estimates 
the more significant areas requiring the use of assumptions  judgments and estimates relate to volumes of oil and gas reserves used in calculating depletion  the amount of future net revenues used in computing the ceiling test limitations and the amount of abandonment obligations used in such calculations 
assumptions  judgments and estimates are also required in determining impairments of undeveloped properties and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
oil and gas reserves 
the company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves are estimates which  by their nature  are subject to revision 
the estimates are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates are currently made annually by independent petroleum engineers and reviewed by the company s engineers 
the reserves are periodically reviewed and revised  either upward or downward  if warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in assumptions based on  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the company s dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves could also result in a full cost ceiling writedown see discussion below 
the present value of oil and gas properties represents the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted using a prescribed discount rate pv 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reserves are considered proved if they can be produced economically as demonstrated by either actual production or conclusive formation tests 
proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
due to the volatility of commodity prices  the oil and gas prices on the last day of the period significantly impact the calculation of the pv the present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of the company s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
full cost method of accounting 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas operations 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which the company incurs costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
effective with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  the carrying amount of oil and gas properties includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation when incurred 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development costs of oil and gas properties for each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method 
changes in estimates of reserves  future development costs or asset retirement obligations are accounted for prospectively in our depletion calculation 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
for purposes of the full cost ceiling calculation  future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the company s balance sheet are excluded from the computation of the present value of estimated future net revenues 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties 
table of contents reduced by any related deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or non cash writedown is required 
a ceiling test impairment can give the company a significant loss for a particular period  however  future depletion  depreciation and amoritization expense would be reduced 
the company did not have any writedowns related to the full cost ceiling limitation in  or as of december   the ceiling limitation exceeded the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately billion in the us and million in china 
estimates of discounted future net cash flows at december  were based on average natural gas prices of approximately per mcf in the us and on average liquids prices of approximately per barrel in the us in china  estimates of discounted future net cash flows on crude oil were based on a net realized price of per barrel 
a reduction in oil and gas prices and or estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves would reduce the ceiling limitation in the us and could result in a ceiling test writedown 
asset retirement obligation 
the company s asset retirement obligations aro consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and gas properties 
sfas no 
requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an aro  estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  the company must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a 
entitlements method of accounting for oil and gas sales 
the company generally sells natural gas  condensate and crude oil under both long term and short term agreements at prevailing market prices 
the company recognizes revenues when the products are delivered  which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership  prices are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company accounts for oil and gas sales using the entitlements method 
under the entitlements method  revenue is recorded based upon the company s ownership share of volumes sold  regardless of whether it has taken its ownership share of such volumes 
the company records a receivable or a liability to the extent it receives less or more than its share of the volumes and related revenue 
under the alternative sales method of accounting for oil and gas sales  revenue would be recorded based on volumes taken by the company or allocated to it by third parties  regardless of whether such volumes are more or less than its ownership share of volumes produced 
reserve estimates would be adjusted to reflect any over produced or under produced positions 
receivables or payables would be recognized on a company s balance sheet only to the extent that remaining reserves are not sufficient to satisfy volumes over or under produced 
make up provisions and ultimate settlements of volume imbalances are generally governed by agreements between the company and its partners with respect to specific properties or  in the absence of such agreements  through negotiation 
the value of volumes over or under produced can change based on changes in commodity prices 
the company prefers the entitlements method of accounting for oil and gas sales because it allows for recognition of revenue based on its actual share of jointly owned production  results in better matching of revenue with related operating expenses  and provides balance sheet recognition of the estimated value of product imbalances 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
to assess the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
in order to fully realize its us net deferred tax asset at december   the company will need to generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards in to based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not the company will realize the benefits of these 
table of contents deductible differences at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced 
commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company periodically enters into commodity derivative contracts and fixed price physical contracts to manage its exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
the company primarily utilizes price swaps  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counter parties of high credit quality that it believes are minimal credit risks 
the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivatives contracts are based upon crude oil and natural gas futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices the company receives 
under sfas no 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
for qualifying fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is offset by related results of the hedged item in the income statement 
gains and losses on hedging instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to oil and natural gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company currently does not have any derivative contracts in place that do not qualify as cash flow hedges 
legal  environmental and other contingencies 
a provision for legal  environmental and other contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingencies and periodically determines when the company should record losses for these items based on information available to the company 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this increase was attributable to an increase in both the company s production and prices received for that production 
during this period the company s production increased to bcf of gas and thousand barrels of condensate in wyoming and thousand barrels of crude oil in china  up from bcf of gas and thousand barrels of condensate in wyoming 
this increase on a mcfe basis was attributable to the company s successful drilling activities during and in wyoming and initiation of production in china

in previous years the company did not purchase tubular materials prior to when they would be used 
liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   the company relied on cash provided by operations and borrowings under its senior credit facility to finance its capital expenditures 
the company participated in the drilling of wells in wyoming and continued to participate in the development process in the china blocks  including the ongoing drilling of development wells 
due to this continued development in china  the company saw first production from these properties in july for the year ended december  net capital expenditures were million 
at december   the company reported a cash position of million compared to million at december  working capital deficit at december  was million as compared to million at december  as of december   the company had incurred bank indebtedness of million and other long term obligations of million comprised of items payable in more than one year  primarily related to production taxes

the company currently has no budget for acquisitions in the company through its subsidiary participates in a long term credit facility with a group of banks led by bank one na the agreement specifies a maximum loan amount of million and an aggregate borrowing base of million and a commitment amount of million at november  the commitment amount may be increased up to the lesser of the borrowing base amount or million at any time at the request of the company 
each bank shall have the right  but not the obligation  to increase the amount of their commitment as requested by the company 
in the event that the existing banks increase their commitment to an amount less than the requested commitment amount  then it would be necessary to bring additional banks into the facility 
at december   the company had million outstanding and million unused and available under the current committed amount 
the credit facility matures on may  the note bears interest at either the bank s prime rate plus a margin of one quarter of one percent to seven eighths of one percent based on the percentage of available credit drawn or at libor plus a margin of one and one quarter percent to one and seven eighths of one percent based on the percentage of available credit drawn 
for the purposes of calculating interest  the available credit is equal to the borrowing base 
an average annual commitment fee of to  depending on the percentage of available credit drawn  is charged quarterly for any unused portion of the commitment amount 
the borrowing base is subject to periodic at least semi annual review and re determination by the banks and may be decreased or increased depending on a number of factors  including the company s proved reserves and the bank s forecast of future oil and gas prices 
if the borrowing base is reduced to an amount less than the balance outstanding  the company has sixty days from the date of written notice of the reduction in the borrowing base to pay the difference 
additionally  the company is subject to quarterly reviews of compliance with the covenants under the bank facility including minimum coverage ratios relating to interest  working capital and advances to sino american energy corporation 
in the event of a default under the covenants  the company may not be able to access funds otherwise available under the facility 
as of december   the company was in compliance with required ratios of the bank facility 
the debt outstanding under the credit facility is secured by a majority of the company s proved domestic oil and gas properties 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the increase in earnings  dd a and deferred taxes  all attributable to higher production levels 
during the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the change is primarily attributable to increased activity for drilling and completion operations in wyoming 
the million used in oil and gas property expenditures consists of million incurred for drilling and completion activities in  offset by million attributable to capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid 
during the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the change is primarily attributable to drawing down additional debt under the senior credit facility and proceeds of employee stock option exercises 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  less than more than total one year years years years long term debt operating leases office space lease total contractual obligations as of december  the company had committed to drilling obligations in progress that will continue into the company s senior credit facility with its group of banks matures on may  unless the facility is extended or a new facility put into place  the full amount drawn under the facility would become due and payable at that time 
the company believes that it will be able to extend or renew the facility or one substantially similar to the existing facility prior to may  on october  the operator of the company s properties in china  kerr mcgee operator  signed a year contract  which provides for up to an additional years  to lease the fpso 
the company ratified the contract for its net share which is 
the fpso service agreement calls for a day rate lease payment and a sliding scale per barrel processing fee that decreases based on cumulative barrels processed 
the lease contains a cancellation fee for the company based on a sliding time scale cancellation fee decreases with time which as of december  was million net to the company s interest 
the company considers it very unlikely that a lease cancellation situation will occur 
due to the terms of the lease  the company cannot estimate with any degree of accuracy the costs it may incur during the life of the lease 
the company s net share for the costs of the fpso in was approximately million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its gas and oil production 
realized pricing is currently driven primarily by the prevailing price for the company s wyoming natural gas production 
historically  prices received for gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
pricing volatility is expected to continue 
gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during realized natural gas prices are derived from the financial statements which include the effects of hedging and gas balancing 
the company uses derivative instruments as one way to manage its exposure to commodity prices 
the company has periodically entered into fixed price to index price swap agreements in order to hedge a portion of its production 
the purpose of the swaps is to provide a measure of stability to the company s cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices 
the derivatives reduce the company s exposure on the hedged volumes to decreases in commodity prices and limit the benefit the company might otherwise have received from any increases in commodity prices on the hedged volumes 
the company recognizes all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting treatment of the changes in fair value as specified in sfas no 
is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is 
table of contents designated as a hedge 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings as oil and gas revenue 
for all other derivatives  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as income or expense 
at december  the company had a current derivative liability of  which is included in current liabilities in our balance sheet 
the company designates these derivatives as cash flow hedges 
during  the company made payments on financially settled swaps to counterparties totaling  as its net cost from hedging activities 
this total includes  for the first quarter of   for the second quarter of   for the third quarter of  and  for the fourth quarter of at december   the company had the following open derivative contracts to manage price risk on a portion of its natural gas production all prices southwest wyoming basis
