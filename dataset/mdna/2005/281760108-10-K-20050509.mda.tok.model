these revenues can be categorized into four main components transaction based revenues  asset management services  interest on margin accounts and underwriting and management fees from investment banking transactions 
transaction based revenues are driven from the purchase or sale of securities by clients for their accounts 
the company earns commissions for acting as an agent for the client in the equity and fixed income markets  as a dealer when the client purchases either fixed income or equity securities from inventory  or from selling concessions when the client purchases newly issued securities in investment banking transactions 
these revenues can be affected by trading volumes  by market and economic conditions  and by investor sentiment because the company s clients are primarily retail oriented 
revenues from asset management services are based principally on the amount of certain client assets purchased or held through the company 
these assets may be managed by the company or by third party investment managers  including mutual funds  managed futures funds  money market funds  annuities and insurance contracts 
the company manages client assets through the ag edwards trust company fsb  a wholly owned subsidiary  and through edwards asset management service

investment banking management fees result from bringing new issues of securities  both equity based and fixed income based  to the market for issuers 
the issuers are generally corporate or municipal clients but may be institutional clients in the case of exchange traded funds and related products 
the fees generated from these transactions vary depending on the number and size of transactions successfully completed 
the company s expenses are primarily related to compensation and benefits 
the largest components are variable in nature and relate to commissions paid to the company s financial consultants related to transaction based or asset management services and incentive compensation  which is largely based on the profitability of the company 
the company is focusing on making a larger portion of its non compensation expenses more variable in nature  particularly those expenses related to its back office systems

critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  management makes use of certain estimates and assumptions 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following critical policies  estimates and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are the most susceptible to significant fluctuations in the near term 
valuation of investments the fair value of investments  for which a quoted market or dealer price is not available  is based on management s estimate 
among the factors considered by management in determining the fair value of investments are cost  terms and liquidity of the investment  the sale price of recently issued securities  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows  the long term business potential of the issuer  the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yields that are publicly traded  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
valuation of stock options the company applies the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations to account for options granted under its incentive stock plan 
based on the provisions of this plan  no compensation expense has been recognized for options issued under this plan 
the fair value of the stock options is estimated using expected dividend yields of the company s stock  the expected volatility of the stock  the expected length of time the options remain outstanding  risk free interest rates and expected forfeiture rates 
changes in one or more of these factors may significantly affect the estimated fair value of the stock options 
please see recent accounting pronouncements below for discussion of pending guidance on stock based compensation 
software development costs the company applies the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  to account for costs associated with internally developed software 
the company capitalizes the costs associated with software development based on guidance provided in the statement 
the primary factors considered in determining the amount to capitalize include the stage of the development effort and the type of work being performed 
only costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized 
when placed in service  these costs are typically amortized over three to five years and are included in communication and technology expense on the company s consolidated statements of earnings 
allowance for doubtful accounts from customers receivables from customers consist primarily of floating rate loans collateralized by margin securities 
management estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential losses from unsecured and partially unsecured customer accounts deemed uncollectible 
the facts and circumstances surrounding each receivable and the number of shares  price and volatility of the underlying collateral are considered by management in determining the allowance 
management continually evaluates its receivables from customers for collectibility and possible write off 
the company manages the credit risk associated with its receivables from customers through credit limits and continuous monitoring of collateral 
legal reserves and regulatory matters the company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits  in some of which plaintiffs claim substantial amounts  relating primarily to its securities and commodities business 
management has determined that it is likely that ultimate resolution in favor of the plaintiffs will result in losses to the company on certain of these claims and as a result  establishes accruals for potential litigation losses 
the company also is involved  from time to time  in investigations and proceedings by governmental and self regulatory agencies  certain of which may result in adverse judgments  fines or penalties 
factors considered by management in estimating the company s reserve for these matters are the loss and damages sought by the plaintiffs  the merits of the claims  the total cost of defending the litigation  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claims  and the potential for fines and penalties from regulatory agencies 
management  based on its understanding of the facts  reasonably estimates a range of loss and accrues what it considers appropriate to reserve against probable loss for certain claims and regulatory matters 
while results of litigation and investigations and proceedings by governmental and self regulatory agencies or the results of judgments  fines or penalties cannot be predicted with certainty  management  after consultation with counsel believes that resolution of all such matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated balance sheets  statements of earnings or statements of cash flows of the company  except that  as stated under mutual fund matters included under item of this form k  the company believes  based on current knowledge and after consulting with counsel  that the impact of the matters discussed under mutual fund matters will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of the company  but could be material to the operating results in one or more periods 
income taxes the company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions  and as a result  accruals for tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate tax liability in any given year 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years

management of these risks is necessary for the long term profitability of the company 
the company manages these risks through the establishment of numerous policies  procedures and controls 
the most significant risks to the company are operational  legal  credit and market risk
