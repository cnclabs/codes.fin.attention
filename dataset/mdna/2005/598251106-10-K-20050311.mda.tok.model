item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s principal business is conducted by the banks and consists of a full range of community based financial services  including commercial and retail banking 
the profitability of the company s operations depends primarily on its net interest income  provision for loan losses  other income  and other expenses 
net interest income is the difference between the income the company receives on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the provision for loan losses reflects the cost of credit risk in the company s loan portfolio 
other income consists of service charges on deposit accounts  securities gains or losses  non cash impairment loss on equity securities  net trading profits or losses  gains on sales of loans  insurance and brokerage commissions  trust income  increase in cash surrender value of life insurance  and other income 
other expenses include salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  professional services  and other noninterest expenses 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest and is dependent on the company s asset liability management procedures to cope with such changes 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions 
other expenses are influenced by the growth of operations  with additional employees necessary to staff and open new banking centers and marketing expenses necessary to promote them 
growth in the number of account relationships directly affects such expenses as data processing costs  supplies  postage  and other miscellaneous expenses 
the following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the periods indicated 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the selected consolidated financial data presented herein 
in addition to historical information  the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
discussed below are those critical accounting policies that are of particular significance to the company 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss 
table of contents experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
the company s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses represents an estimation pursuant to either statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  or sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the allowance reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of all commercial  commercial real estate  and agricultural loans over  where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification 
these analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the company s historical loss experience is updated quarterly 
the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations and changes in portfolio mix and volume  and other qualitative factors 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their losses  may require the company to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
the process for determining the allowance which management believes adequately considers all of the potential factors which might possibly result in credit losses includes subjective elements and  therefore  may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
evaluation of securities for impairment securities are classified as held to maturity when the company has the ability and management has the positive intent to hold those securities to maturity 
accordingly  they are stated at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
securities are classified as available for sale when the company may decide to sell those securities due to changes in market interest rates  liquidity needs  changes in yields or alternative investments  and for other reasons 
they are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported in other comprehensive income loss 
interest income is reported net of amortization of premium and accretion of discount 
realized gains and losses on disposition of securities available for sale are based on the net proceeds and the adjusted carrying amounts of the securities sold  using the specific identification method 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary losses  management considers the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the evaluation also considers the impact that impairment may have on future capital  earnings  and liquidity 
fair value of financial instruments and derivatives fair values of financial instruments  including derivatives  are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions 
fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates  credit risk  prepayments  and other factors  especially in the absence of broad markets for the particular items 
there is no ready market for 
table of contents a significant portion of the company s financial instruments 
accordingly  fair values are based on various factors relative to expected loss experience  current economic conditions  risk characteristics  and other factors 
the assumptions and estimates used in the fair value determination process are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment 
as a consequence  fair values cannot be determined with precision 
changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates

net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis increased million  or  to million in from million in  despite a modest increase in interest income on total earning assets of  in the driving force behind the increase in net interest income was a million decrease in interest expense 
interest income on loans on a fully tax equivalent basis decreased million to million in from million in due to a decrease in average rates paid on loans from to 
interest income on securities on a fully tax equivalent basis increased million to million in from million in even though yields on securities decreased from in to in due to the recognition of premium amortization expense associated with the mortgage backed securities the company holds in its investment securities portfolio as a result of the low interest rate environment 
the increase in interest income on securities occurred due to a significant increase in average securities from million in to million in interest expense on interest bearing liabilities decreased million to million in from million in  or  due primarily to the repricing opportunities on core deposits and certificates of deposits which decreased interest expense by million in interest expense on total borrowings increased slightly due to a million increase in average repurchase agreements during in addition  the company issued million in company obligated mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities with an initial rate of and million in company obligated mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities with an initial rate of in december with a maturity of years 
the added interest expense from these issuances will be fully reflected during the net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis decreased from in to for the primary reason for the decrease in net interest margin was attributable to the basis points decrease in yields on investment portfolio as a result of the million increase in premium amortization expense associated with the mortgage back securities

the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is days past due unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan 
in all cases  loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against interest income 
the interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual

the classification of a loan as impaired or nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible  in whole or in part 
the company makes a determination as to the collectibility on a case by case basis based upon the specific facts of each situation 
the company considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect impaired or nonaccrual loans 
alternatives that are typically considered to collect impaired or nonaccrual loans are foreclosure  collection under guarantees  loan restructuring  or judicial collection actions 
loans that are considered to be impaired are reduced to the present value of expected future cash flows or to the fair value of the related collateral by allocating a portion of the allowance to such loans 
if these allocations require an increase to be made to the allowance for loan losses  such increase is reported as a provision for loan losses charged to expense

see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
analysis of allowance for loan losses the company recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  and in the case of a collateralized loan  the quality of the collateral for such loan 
the allowance for loan losses represents the company s estimate of the amount needed necessary to provide for probable incurred losses in the portfolio 
in making this determination  the company analyzes the ultimate collectibility of the loans in its portfolio by incorporating feedback provided by internal loan staff and information provided by examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the company makes an ongoing evaluation as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  management of the banks meets to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
each loan officer grades these individual commercial credits and the company s independent loan review personnel reviews the officers grades 
in the event that the loan is downgraded during this review  the loan is included in the allowance analysis at the lower grade 
the grading system is in compliance with the regulatory classifications  and the allowance is allocated to the loans based on the regulatory grading  except in instances where there are known differences eg collateral value is nominal 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change

during and  the company experienced asset quality deterioration in commercial and commercial real estate loans 
asset quality has improved and is evidenced by the following net commercial loan charge offs were  in compared to million in net commercial real estate loan charge offs were  in compared to million in loans subject to adverse classification substandard and doubtful have decreased to million at december  from million at december  the company utilizes an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets 
at each scheduled bank board of directors meeting  a watch list is presented  showing significant loan relationships listed as special mention  substandard  and doubtful 
set forth below is a discussion of each of these classifications 
december  in thousands special mention substandard doubtful total special mention a special mention extension of credit is defined as having potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention 
if left uncorrected  these potential weaknesses may  at some future date  result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or the institution s credit position 
special mention credits are not considered as part of the classified extensions of credit category and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification 
they are currently protected but are potentially weak 
they constitute an undue and unwarranted credit risk 
loans in this category have some identifiable problem  most notably slowness in payments  but  in management s opinion  offer no immediate risk of loss 
an extension of credit that is not delinquent also may be identified as special mention 
these loans are classified due to bank management s actions or the servicing of the loan 
the lending officer may be unable to properly supervise the credit because of an inadequate loan or credit agreement 
there may be questions regarding the condition of and or control over collateral 
economic or market conditions may unfavorably affect the obligor in the future 
a declining trend in the obligor s operations or an imbalanced position in the balance sheet may exist  although it is not to the point that repayment is jeopardized 
another example of a special mention credit is one that has other deviations from prudent lending practices 
if the bank may have to consider relying on a secondary or alternative source of repayment  then collection may not yet be in jeopardy  but the loan may be considered special mention 
other trends that indicate that the loan may deteriorate further include such red flags as continuous overdrafts  negative trends on a financial statement  such as a deficit net worth  a delay in the receipt of financial statements  accounts receivable ageings  etc 
these loans on a regular basis can be days or more past due 
judgments  tax liens  delinquent real estate taxes  cancellation of insurance policies and exceptions to bank policies are other red flags 
substandard a substandard extension of credit is one inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
extensions of credit so classified must have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not 
table of contents corrected 
in other words  there is more than normal risk of loss 
loss potential  while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard credits  does not have to exist in individual extensions of credit classified substandard 
the likelihood that a substandard loan will be paid from the primary source of repayment may also be uncertain 
financial deterioration is underway and very close attention is warranted to insure that the loan is collected without a loss 
the bank may be relying on a secondary source of repayment  such as liquidating collateral  or collecting on guarantees 
the borrower cannot keep up with either the interest or principal payments 
if the bank is forced into a subordinated or unsecured position due to flaws in documentation  the loan may also be substandard 
if the loan must be restructured  or interest rate concessions made  it should be classified as such 
if the bank is contemplating foreclosure or legal action  the credit is likely substandard 
doubtful an extension of credit classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
the possibility of loss is extremely high  however  because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and strengthen the credit  its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined 
pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition  liquidation proceedings  capital injection  perfecting liens on additional collateral  or refinancing plans 
if the primary source of repayment is gone  and there is doubt as to the quality of the secondary source  then the loan will be considered doubtful 
if a court suit is pending  and is the only means of collection  a loan is generally doubtful 
as stated above  the loss amount in this category is often undeterminable  and the loan is classified doubtful until said loss can be determined 
the company s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the banks primary regulators in the course of its regulatory examinations  which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request the company to materially increase its allowance for loan losses 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
the company s allowance for loan losses at december  is considered by management to be adequate

in january  the company purchased million in mortgage backed securities with a weighted average yield of and duration of years million of these purchases are hybrid arms   and products with yields ranging between to and duration from to years  and million was invested in a year product with a yield of and duration of years 
securities held to maturity increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  there were no trading securities held at december  or december  the company holds trading securities and derivatives on a short term basis based on market and liquidity conditions 
the company intends to implement strategies to reduce its securities as a percentage of earning assets and provide funding for higher yielding loans 
the company expects these newly purchased securities mentioned above to provide added cash flow to fund future loan growth  and its focus on future investment purchases is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity and to shorten the duration of its investment portfolio 
during the third quarter of  the company reclassified approximately million of mortgage backed securities from the available for sale category to the held to maturity category under permissible provisions of fasb this transfer was required to be at fair value which resulted in an unrealized gain and accumulated other comprehensive income at the time of transfer  of  and  respectively  which is being amortized accreted to expense income over the life of the securities as a yield adjustment 
this transfer was completed in order to enhance the company s interest rate risk by matching longer term assets with longer term funding sources 
the company has a number of available for sale securities that have unrealized losses at december    and  see note to the notes to consolidated financials statements for further information 
during the past two years  the company has purchased securities in the lowest interest rate environment in over years 
in a rising interest rate environment  the fair value of securities will likely decrease 
the company has both the intent and ability to hold these securities for a time necessary to recover its amortized cost 
this temporary loss is reflected net of tax in other comprehensive loss which does not impact regulatory capital 
the company recognized a million other than temporary non cash impairment charge on its investment in a single federal national mortgage association preferred stock issuance 
although this investment has a variable  tax advantaged dividend rate that resets every two years at the two year treasury rate less basis points and carries an investment grade rating  the market value of this investment is 
table of contents impacted by the current and expected level of interest rates 
as a result  this investment has reflected varying loss positions since while the company expected this investment to recover its original cost as interest rates increase and had both the intent and ability to hold the investment until such recovery occurred  this investment was deemed to be other than temporarily impaired given the duration of the unrealized loss position and uncertainty as to the timing of a full recovery 
it is the practice of the company not to retain securities that are classified other than temporarily impaired 
these securities were liquidated in february at a million gain in excess of the year end value 
in  the company entered into  us treasury year note futures contracts with a notional value of million and a delivery date of march the company had  us treasury year note futures contracts with a notional value of million outstanding at december  the company sold these contracts in order to hedge certain us agency notes held in its available for sale portfolio 
the company s objective was to offset changes in the fair market value of the us agency notes with changes in the fair market value of the futures contracts  thereby reducing interest rate risk 
the company documented these futures contracts as fair value hedges with the changes in market value of the futures contracts as well as the changes in the market value of the hedged items charged or credited to earnings on a quarterly basis in net gains losses on securities transactions 
the hedging relationship is assessed to ensure that there is a high correlation between the hedge instruments and hedged items 
for the year ending december   the change in the market values resulted in a net loss of million which was recorded in net gains losses on securities transactions compared to the  loss recorded for the year ended december  gains or losses for fair value hedges occur when changes in the market value of the hedged items are not identical to changes in the market value of hedge instruments during the reporting period

 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
revised december 
fin establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities vie that function to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a vie entity is the entity that absorbs a majority of the vie s expected losses  receives a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  controlling interest  contractual relationship or other business relationship with the vie 
prior to the implementation of fin  vie s were generally consolidated by an enterprise when the enterprise had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority of voting interest in the entity 
the provisions of fin were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january  if a vie existed prior to february   fin was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  however  subsequent revisions to the interpretation deferred the implementation date of fin until the first period ending after december  the trust preferred securities issued by mbhi capital trust i  ii  iii and iv are currently included in the tier capital of the company for regulatory capital purposes 
the federal reserve may in the future disallow inclusion of the trust preferred securities in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
in july  the federal reserve issued a supervisory letter instructing bank holding companies to continue to include the trust preferred securities in their tier capital for regulatory capital purposes until notice is given to the contrary 
the federal reserve intends to review the regulatory implications of the change in accounting treatment of subsidiary trusts that issue trust preferred securities and  if necessary or warranted  provide further appropriate guidance 
there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will continue to permit institutions to include trust preferred securities in tier i capital for regulatory capital purposes 
as of december   assuming the company was not permitted to include the million in trust preferred securities issued by mbhi capital trust i  ii  iii and iv in its tier capital  the company would still exceed the regulatory required minimums for capital adequacy purposes 
if the trust preferred securities were no longer permitted to be included in tier capital  the company would also be permitted to redeem the capital securities without penalty 
the interpretations of fin and its application to various transaction types and structures are continually evolving 
management continuously monitors emerging issues related to fin  some of which could potentially impact the company s financial statements 

table of contents capital resources the company monitors compliance with bank and bank holding company regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent upon the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
included in the risk based capital method are two measures of capital adequacy  tier  or core capital  and total capital  which consists of tier plus tier capital

liquidity the company manages its liquidity position with the objective of maintaining sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million 
in addition to the normal inflow of funds from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and securities  the company utilizes other short term  intermediate term and long term funding sources such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase  overnight funds purchased from correspondent banks and the acceptance of short term deposits from public entities 
the fhlb provides an additional source of liquidity 
the banks have used the fhlb extensively since assuming that collateral is available to secure loans  each bank can borrow up to of its assets from the fhlb which provided the banks with a total additional million in unused capacity at december  the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its current and future liquidity needs 
the banks also have various funding arrangements with commercial and investment banks providing up to billion of available funding sources in the form of federal funds lines  repurchase agreements  and brokered and public funds certificate of deposit programs 
unused capacity under these lines was billion at december  the banks maintain these funding arrangements to achieve favorable costs of funds  manage interest rate risk  and enhance liquidity in the event of deposit withdrawals 
the repurchase agreements and public funds certificate of deposit are subject to the availability of collateral 
the company monitors and manages its liquidity position on several levels  which vary depending upon the time period 
as the time period is expanded  other data is factored in  including estimated loan funding 
table of contents requirements  estimated loan payoffs  securities portfolio maturities or calls  and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs 
the company classifies the majority of its securities as available for sale  thereby maintaining significant liquidity 
the company s liquidity position is further enhanced by the structuring of a majority of its loan portfolio interest payments as monthly and also by the representation of residential mortgage loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the company s cash flows are composed of three classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of earnings  was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities  which was primarily due to the securities activity  was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and net used in investing activities  consisting primarily of loan and investment funding  was million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities  which consisted of the payments on borrowings net of deposit growth  was million for the year ended december   and net provided by was million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

all of the financial instruments of the company as of december  were for other than trading purposes 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on its interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is therefore sensitive to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s asset liability management strategy is to maximize net interest income while limiting exposure to risks associated to changes in interest rates 
this strategy is implemented by the company s ongoing analysis and management of its interest rate risk 
a principal function of asset liability management is to coordinate the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
in january  the company entered into a plain vanilla interest rate swap with a counterparty in order to convert its million of outstanding trust preferred securities and related company obligated mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities from a fixed rate instrument into floating rate debt 
the average yield on the million trust preferred securities and related company obligated mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities was for the first nine months of during july of  the company terminated the fair value hedge in exchange for  approximately  of this amount was determined to be due to hedge ineffectiveness and recognized into income in the third quarter of the remaining amount is being accreted into income  as a reduction of interest expense  over the estimated life of the company obligated mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities 
the company enters into hedging activities to convert interest payments of some of its fixed rate liabilities into floating rate liabilities 
as of december   the company has various interest rate swap transactions  which results in the company converting million of its fhlb advance fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
the swap transactions require payment of interest by the company at the one month libor rate plus a spread and  in turn  the company receives a fixed rate interest payment equal to the fixed rate paid on the related fhlb advances 
as libor increases  the level of reduced interest expense on these advances decreases  that is  the benefit from the swap transactions decreases 
the company has documented these to be fair value hedges 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the company entered into  us treasury year note futures contracts with a notional value of million and a delivery date of march the company had  us treasury year note futures contracts with a notional value of million outstanding at december  the 
table of contents company sold these contracts in order to hedge certain us agency notes held in its available for sale portfolio 
the company s objective was to offset changes in the fair market value of the us agency notes with changes in the fair market value of the futures contracts  thereby reducing interest rate risk 
the company documented these futures contracts as fair value hedges with the changes in market value of the futures contracts as well as the changes in the market value of the hedged items charged or credited to earnings on a quarterly basis in net gains losses on securities transactions 
the hedging relationship is assessed to ensure that there is a high correlation between the hedge instruments and hedged items 
for the year ending december   the change in the market values resulted in a net loss of million which was recorded in net gains losses on securities transactions compared to the  loss recorded for the year ended december  gains or losses for fair value hedges occur when changes in the market value of the hedged items are not identical to changes in the market value of hedge instruments during the reporting period 
the company de designated this hedge as of december  and the futures contracts are stand alone derivatives 
these futures contracts were terminated in january in  the company entered into spread lock swap agreements with a notional vale of million  determination date of march   and spread lock strike of 
the company entered into this contract in order to minimize earnings volatility associated with spread widening of the hedged us agency notes through the first quarter of these are stand alone derivatives that are carried at their estimated fair value with the corresponding gain or loss recorded in net trading profits or losses 
the company terminated these agreements in january interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals and interest rate indices of the interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  thus creating a risk that will result in disproportionate changes in the value of and the net earnings generated from the company s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through the company s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
because the company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  the company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer maturity preferences in the market areas in which the company operates 
borrowings  which include fhlb advances  short term borrowings  and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which  in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the rates  terms  and interest rate indices of the company s interest earning assets result primarily from the company s strategy of investing in securities and loans a substantial portion of which have adjustable rate terms 
this permits the company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread from the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
management uses a duration model for each of the banks internal asset liability management 
the model uses cash flows and repricing information from loans and certificate of deposits  plus repricing assumptions on products without specific repricing dates eg  savings and interest bearing demand deposits  to calculate the durations of each of the banks assets and liabilities 
securities are stress tested  and the theoretical changes in cash flow are key elements of the company s model 
the model also projects the effect on the company s earnings and theoretical value for a change in interest rates 
the model computes the duration of each of the banks rate sensitive assets and liabilities  a theoretical market value of each of the banks and the effects of rate changes on each of the banks earnings and market value 
the banks exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a monthly basis by senior management and the company s board of directors 
effects of inflation inflation can have a significant effect on the operating results of all industries 
however  management believes that inflationary factors are not as critical to the banking industry as they are to other industries  due to the high concentration of relatively short duration monetary assets in the banking industry 
inflation does  
table of contents however  have some impact on the company s growth  earnings  and total assets and on its need to closely monitor its equity capital levels 
management does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but it is difficult to assess the impact  since neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes in the various inflation indices coincide with changes in interest rates 
inflation does impact the economic value of longer term  interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  but the company attempts to limit its long term assets and liabilities  as indicated in the tables set forth under financial condition and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s overall interest rate sensitivity is demonstrated by net interest income analysis 
net interest income analysis measures the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
this analysis assesses the risk of change in net interest income in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decrease in market interest rates 
the tables below present the company s projected changes in net interest income for the various rate shock levels at december  and  respectively 
net interest income dollar amount change change dollars in thousands bp bp base bp net interest income dollar amount change change dollars in thousands bp bp base bp as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would increase the company s net interest income by  or approximately  overall net interest income sensitivity has decreased from to  and remains within the company s and recommended regulatory guidelines 
this decreased sensitivity was due to the changes in interest rates that affected various earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
due to the level of interest rates at december   the company is not able to model an additional basis point decrease in rates 
as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the company s net income by  or approximately  due to the level of interest rates at december   the company is not able to model an additional basis point decrease in rates 
gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as of december   and provides the repricing dates of the company s interest earning assets and interest

loans are included in the above table based on contractual maturity or contractual repricing dates 
computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay rates 
these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
actual values may differ from those projections set forth above  should market conditions vary from assumptions used in preparing the analyses 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the gap analysis is based upon assumptions as to when assets and liabilities will reprice in a changing interest rate environment 
because such assumptions can be no more than estimates  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes than those estimated 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
therefore  the gap table included above does not and cannot necessarily indicate the actual future impact of
