in general  any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  projects  expects  estimates  and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
investors should be aware that such forward looking statements are intended to provide management s current expectations for the future operating and financial performance of the company based on assumptions believed to be valid at the time 
thus  such expectations are inherently subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from those reflected in forward looking statements 
in addition to general economic conditions and market trends  some of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  the following a major downturn of the north american or european automotive markets although lydall s automotive sales are not solely contingent on the strength of the automotive market  a significant downturn of the north american or european automotive industries or a major decline in production of specific vehicles on which lydall has significant content could have a substantial impact on lydall s results 
the company can also be affected when automotive manufacturers discontinue production of specific models that contain lydall s products 
conversely  lydall benefits from the introduction of new models that contain the company s products 
approximately percent of lydall s total net sales in were to the automotive market 
lydall s automotive products are thermal and acoustical barriers employed both inside and under the body of vehicles 
most of lydall s products are supplied to meet unique  niche applications 
lydall may have a number of components on a particular automotive platform and applications can range across all types of vehicles from sport utility models to trucks  vans and cars 
thus  there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the number of lydall products sold and the number of vehicles being built by automotive manufacturers 
raw material pricing and supply raw material pricing and supply issues affect all of lydall s businesses and can influence results in the short term 
the thermal acoustical segment uses aluminum and other metals to manufacture most automotive heat shields 
volatility in metals prices could impact the thermal acoustical segment s profitability where the company is selling its products under long term agreements with fixed sales prices 
new product introductions improved performance and growth is partially linked to new product introductions planned for the future 
the timing and degree of success of new product programs could impact lydall s anticipated results 
lydall does not undertake to update any forward looking statement made in this report or that may from time to time be made by or on behalf of the company 
overview lydall s thermal acoustical and filtration separation businesses are in markets that present good growth opportunities and we expect the businesses to grow over the long term  primarily through the introduction of new products and penetration of new markets 
the company has substantially completed the consolidation of the domestic automotive manufacturing operations as of december  this consolidation supports long term growth strategies for this business and is expected to improve flexibility  lower costs and utilize overall capacity of existing facilities more effectively 
the total pretax costs related to the restructuring effort recorded during were million and approximately million is expected to be incurred to finalize this effort during although the significant consolidation activities are substantially complete  the company expects that during the early part of there will continue to be some impact related to streamlining processes at the two remaining locations and maximizing synergies of the production activities that were relocated and realigned during this process 
the opening of the automotive facility located in st 
nazaire  france during provided much needed relief to the overcapacity issues that the automotive operation in germany had been experiencing for some time 
this new facility is strategically located to complement the company s operations in germany  enabling lydall to service all major european automotive manufacturers 
the transfer of production of certain parts began in the second quarter of as of december   most platforms scheduled to be transferred from germany had been moved and were in full production at the new facility  with the remaining transfers to be completed during the first quarter of the operation experienced an operating loss of approximately million during primarily related to its start up activities

the company incurred approximately million in external consulting and audit costs during related to this initiative 
although the company expects these costs to decline from levels  they are expected to continue to have a material impact on the results of operations and cash flows going forward 
in january  the charter medical  ltd 
subsidiary of lydall announced a product recall of certain of its blood transfer and storage products upon the discovery of procedural deficiencies in the sterilization validation process 
although neither the company nor charter medical has been notified of any adverse events or reports from customers with regard to these products  charter medical believed it was prudent to voluntarily recall the products 
the current estimated cost of the recall and resultant corrective actions is approximately million to million based upon product quantity and return estimates provided by customers and internal cost estimates 
to the extent that actual product quantity and returns differ from the estimates originally provided to charter medical  the actual cost of the recall could differ from the original estimate 
the company recorded million of expense related to this matter during the fourth quarter of the company further expects that the impact of this recall on sales revenues will be less than million

note in notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management is required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
intangible assets and goodwill the company accounts for business acquisitions under the purchase method whereby the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill represents the costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses

 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives not be amortized  but rather are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the specific guidance and criteria described in the standard 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units as defined in fas  including related goodwill 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows  as well as other factors

pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  fas which requires that pension cost and the related obligations recognized in the consolidated financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the determination of such amounts is made in consultation with the company s outside actuaries based on information and assumptions provided by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the united states 
a significant element in determining the company s pension cost is the expected return on plan assets 
based on a review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets and other factors  the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent was used in determining and pension cost and will be utilized for determining pension cost 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension cost for that year 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred  within certain parameters  as discussed below 
the company continually evaluates its expected long term rate of return and will adjust such rate as deemed appropriate 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  as well as the following year s pension cost 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  corporate debt instruments 
at december   the company determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of basis points from the rate used at december  and basis points from that used at december  increases or decreases in the discount rate result in decreases and increases  respectively  in the projected benefit obligation 
the net effect on pension liabilities from changes in the discount rate is deferred within certain parameters  as discussed below 
fas requires that gains or losses as defined in fas be deferred unless the unrecognized net gain or loss at the end of a year exceeds a corridor as defined in fas 
if the deferred gain or loss exceeds the corridor at the end of the year  then the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over a period equal to the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
as of december   the net deferred loss exceeded the corridor 
consequently pension cost for will include amortization of a portion of the deferred loss in excess of the corridor 
the amount of amortization in future years will be dependent on changes in the components of the deferred loss amount  particularly actual return on plan assets in relation to the estimated return on plan assets  as well as future increases or decreases in the discount rate 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized pension cost of million and pension cost of million for as discussed above  the company lowered the discount rate to percent for purposes of determining pension cost 
pension cost for is expected to be approximately million

deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  related to future tax benefits arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards were million and million at december  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related net future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the projected operating results indicate that the ability to realize the future benefits is uncertain or not likely  a valuation allowance has been provided 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  changes in statutory tax rates and future levels of taxable income 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
conversely  if the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period that such determination was made
