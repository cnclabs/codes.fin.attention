item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected the company s financial position at december  as compared to december  and a comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and these comments should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere herein 
executive overview the year ended december  was both an exciting and challenging year for main street banks  inc the company experienced significant growth and change during the year 
the year began with the successful integration of banks moneyhan hayes insurance agency  inc into the company in january 
in addition to the acquisition of the insurance agency  the company also opened its new midtown center  and moved into new prototype banking centers in roswell  winder and conyers 
the strong operating results were highlighted by a percent increase in net income compared to the prior year with double digit loan and core deposit growth loans increased million or percent  compared to the prior year 
asset quality was stable due to the company s insistence on properly margined collateral and principal guarantees in its lending policies  and due to the overall strength of the atlanta economy 
total deposits increased million  or percent during the year 
the deposit mix improved as transaction deposits grew percent compared to december  non interest income increased million or percent compared to the prior years during the company faces many risks and a great deal of competition 
key objectives and principles have been established to manage risks and maintain solid financial results 
the following principles are of the greatest concern to management and are reflected in management s decision making in daily decisions and in long term strategic planning solidify our position as atlanta s community banking market leader continue strong internal growth of loans and deposits maintain asset quality by keeping delinquency trends stable  limiting shared national credits  having a high percentage of portfolio well collateralized  and keeping nonperforming assets low through active management and disciplined underwriting criteria 
use a disciplined  limited  and rational acquisition strategy to achieve external growth when possible 
the company has announced two new banking centers located in the galleria business district cobb county  ga  and suwanee  ga to aid in future growth 
additionally  the company will continue to commit resources to both msb payroll solutions  llc and piedmont settlement services to further enhance fee income and diversify the company s revenue stream 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the parent company and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note a to notes to our consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and the results of operations  and the company considers these to be critical accounting policies 
the following are the accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
the estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and results of operations for the reporting periods 

table of contents allowance for loan losses an allowance for loan losses is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for losses based on management s evaluation 
the evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collection may not be reasonably assumed  considers  among other matters  the fair market value or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral  management s estimate of probable credit losses  historical loan loss experience  and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance 
changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  may require that additions or reductions be made to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and estimates 
historically  our estimates of the level of allowance for loan losses required have been appropriate and have not required significant revision  and we expect that trend to continue 
income taxes the calculation of the company s income tax provision requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination 
as part of the company s evaluation and implementation of business strategies  consideration is given to the regulations and tax laws that apply to the specific facts and circumstances for any transaction under evaluation 
this analysis includes the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
management closely monitors tax developments in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the company s overall tax position 
goodwill in our financial statements  we have recorded million of goodwill and other intangible assets  which represents the amount by which the price we paid for acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of tangible assets acquired plus the liabilities assumed 
the determination of whether these assets are impaired involved significant judgments based upon management s short and long term projections of future performance 
certain of these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding our ability to sustain or increase business 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in changes to recorded asset balances 
on at least an annual basis  the company conducts an evaluation to assess whether the fair value of our recorded goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds the aggregate carrying value of these assets 
as long as the aggregate fair value exceeds the aggregate carrying value  no impairment is recognized in our financial statements 
for the year ended december   management determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 
net income and earnings per share the company s net income was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
basic earnings per share were   and for the same periods  respectively  and diluted earnings per share were  and for the same periods 
earnings growth from to and from to resulted principally from merger activity and an increase in non interest income fueled mainly by insurance agency income and service charges on deposit accounts 
earnings growth was further augmented by an increase in net interest income  which was directly related to an increase in the company s level of earning assets 
earning assets and liabilities average earning assets in increased over due principally to a increase in total loans  offset partially by a decrease in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resell agreements 
the average earning assets mix in changed from with loans at and for and  respectively  and total investment securities at and for and  respectively 
the mix of earning assets is monitored on a continuous basis in order to place the company in a neutral position so movements in interest rates will not adversely impact our return

provision for loan losses management s policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for losses based on management s evaluation of loan portfolio data  specific loan allowance  and current economic conditions 
the evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collection may not be reasonably assumed  considers among other matters  economic conditions  the fair market value or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral  management s estimate of probable credit losses  historical loan loss experience  and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance

the growth in insurance agency income is attributable to the acquisition of bmia 
the growth in fee income was primarily fueled by the growth in demand deposit accounts

the company continues to monitor the composition of the loan portfolio to ensure that the market risk to the balance sheet is not adversely affected by the impact of changes in the economic environment on any one segment of the portfolio 
the company primarily focuses on the following loan categories commercial and industrial  real estate construction  residential mortgage  commercial real estate  and consumer loans 
the company s management has strategically located its branches in high growth markets and has taken advantage of a surge in residential and industrial growth in northern counties of atlanta  georgia 
loans are stated at unpaid principal balances  net of unearned income and deferred loan fees 
interest is accrued only if deemed collectible

the company monitors its lending objectives primarily through its pricing and credit review committees 
the company s lending objectives are clearly defined in its lending policy  which is reviewed annually and approved by the board of directors 
new loans for borrowers with total credit exposure exceeding  require co approval by officers in the bank s credit administration department 
new loans with credit exposure exceeding  require additional approval by one or more executive officers of the bank 
new loans with credit exposure exceeding  require prior approval by the board of directors  which also reviews specific credit approvals exceeding  during the prior month 

table of contents the credit review committee system includes the executive review committee  the eastern and western senior review committees  and the credit risk management committee 
the executive review committee is chaired by the president of the bank and includes officers from the credit administration and credit review departments 
executive review committee annually reviews credit analysis and financial statements for borrowers with credit relationships exceeding  in exposure 
the eastern and western senior review committees annually review credit analysis and financial statements for borrowers with credit relationships exceeding  in total credit exposure up to  in total credit exposure 
this committee is chaired by officers from the credit administration department and its members include officers from the credit review and branch administration areas 
these committees also review delinquent loan accounts and overdrawn deposit accounts during the monthly meeting 
the credit risk management committee meets on a quarterly basis and reviews the bank s larger adversely graded loans 
this committee is chaired by officers from the bank s credit review department and includes officers from the credit administration and branch administration areas 
commercial mortgage lending has significantly contributed to the bank s loan growth during the past several years 
loans included in this category are primarily for the acquisition or refinancing of owner occupied commercial buildings 
these loans are underwritten on the borrower s ability to meet certain minimum debt service requirements and the value of the underlying collateral to meet certain loan to value guidelines 
the bank also perfects its interest in equipment or other business assets of the borrower and obtains personal guaranties 
the bank also underwrites loans to finance the construction of residential properties and commercial properties  which include speculative and pre sale loans 
speculative construction loans involve a higher degree of risk  as these are made on the basis that a borrower will be able to sell the project to a potential buyer after a project is completed 
pre sale construction loans usually have a pre qualified buyer under contract before construction is to begin 
the major risk for pre sale loans is getting the project completed in a timely manner and according to plan specifications 
non residential construction loans include construction loans for churches  commercial buildings  strip shopping centers  and acquisition and development loans 
these loans also carry a higher degree of risk and require strict underwriting guidelines 
all construction loans are secured by first liens on real estate and generally have floating interest rates 
the bank conducts periodic inspections either directly or through an agent prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans 
as an underwriting guideline  management focuses on the borrowers past experience in completing projects in a timely manner and the borrowers financial condition with special emphasis placed on liquidity ratios 
although construction loans are deemed to be of higher risk  the bank believes that it can monitor and manage this risk properly 
the bank also underwrites residential real estate loans 
generally  these loans are owner occupied and are amortized over a to year period with three to five year maturity or repricing 
the underwriting criteria for these loans are very similar to the underwriting criteria used in the mortgage industry 
typically  a borrower s debt to income ratio cannot exceed and the loan to appraised value ratio cannot exceed 
however  the bank s knowledge of its customers and its market allows the company to be more flexible in meeting its customers needs 
the bank also underwrites commercial and industrial loans 
generally  these loans are for working capital purposes and are secured by inventory  accounts receivable  or equipment 
the bank maintains strict underwriting standards for this type of lending 
potential borrowers must meet certain working capital and debt ratios as well as generate positive cash flow from operations 
borrowers in this category will generally have a debt service coverage ratio of at least to the bank will also perfect its interest in equipment or other business assets of the borrower and obtain personal guaranties 
the bank does not originate and does not currently hold in its portfolio any foreign loans 
the bank is also an active participant in the origination of small business administration sba loans 
these loans are solicited from the company s market areas  and are generally underwritten in the same manner as conventional loans generated for the bank s portfolio 
the portion of loans that are secured by the guaranty of the sba may from time to time be sold in the secondary market to provide additional liquidity  and to provide a source of fee income 
consumer loans include automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  boat loans  home improvement loans  home equity loans  personal loans collateralized and uncollateralized and deposit account collateralized loans 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of the loan 
consumer loans involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans 
this is due to the fact that these loans may be unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles 
repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance 
the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by factors such as job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans 
the contractual maturity ranges of the commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and real estate construction portfolios 
table of contents and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of december  are summarized as follows one year or less one year through five years after five years total dollars in thousands commercial and industrial commercial real estate real estate construction total loans with a predetermined interest rate loans with a floating interest rate total investment securities the company uses its securities portfolio both as a source of income and as a source of liquidity 
at december   investment securities totaled million  an increase of million from million at december  at december   investment securities represented of total assets  compared to of total assets at december  the average yield on a fully taxable equivalent basis on the investment portfolio for the year ended december  was compared to a yield of for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  approximately million or of investment securities reprice within one year

within one year after one year but within five years after five years but within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield total dollars in thousands us treasury securities us government agencies and corporations mortgage backed securities state and political subdivisions total mortgage backed securities are securities which have been developed by pooling real estate mortgages and are principally issued by federal agencies such as the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
these 
table of contents securities are deemed to have high credit ratings  minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest  and are guaranteed by the issuing agencies 
at december   of the mortgage backed securities the company held had contractual final maturities of more than five years 
however  unlike us treasury and us government agency securities  which have a lump sum payment at maturity  mortgage backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities 
mortgage backed securities which are purchased at a premium will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because homeowners tend to refinance their mortgages 
thus  the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period 
conversely  these securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment 
as interest rates rise  the opposite will generally be true 
during a period of increasing interest rates  fixed rate mortgage backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently  their average lives will not be unduly shortened 
if interest rates fall  prepayments will increase  and the average life of these securities will decrease 
the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
at the date of purchase  the company is required to classify debt securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading  or available for sale 
equity securities are classified as available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
the company does not have any securities classified as trading securities 
investments not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity  until realized 
the company periodically tests securities for other than temporary impairment 
management does not believe any individual unrealized loss as of december  represents an other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses reported for us government agencies and corporations and mortgage backed securities relate primarily to securities issued by fhlb  fnma  fhlmc and gnma 
these unrealized losses are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and not a change in credit quality 
the investments were individually not significant relative to their respective amortized cost 
deposits the bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
the bank s deposits consist of demand  savings  money market  and time accounts

capital capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations 
the company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve board  the fdic and the georgia department of banking and finance 
both the federal reserve board and the fdic have adopted risk based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy 
these standards define and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off balance sheet exposure  adjusted for credit risk 
the risk based capital standards currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate relative risk weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the risk based capital standards issued by the federal reserve board require all bank holding companies to have tier capital of at least and total risk based capital tier and tier of at least of total risk adjusted assets 
tier capital generally includes common shareholders equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings  less deductions for goodwill and various other intangibles 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of intermediate term preferred stock  a limited amount of term subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  and a limited amount of the general valuation allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the federal reserve board has also adopted guidelines which supplement the risk based capital guidelines with a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets leverage ratio of for institutions with well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and that are generally considered to be strong banking organizations  rated composite under applicable federal guidelines  and that are not experiencing or anticipating significant 
table of contents growth 
other banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to 
these rules further provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels and comparable to peer group averages  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
the following table provides a comparison of the company s and the bank s leverage and risk weighted capital ratios as of december  to the minimum and well capitalized regulatory standards 
for comparative purposes  these ratios are shown both including the proceeds from our million common stock offering in december and excluding the effect of this offering including the effect of the common stock offering excluding the effect of the common stock offering minimum required well capitalized company bank company bank leverage ratio risk based capital ratios tier risk based capital risk based capital pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  each federal banking agency revised its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities  as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multifamily mortgages 
the company is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the fdic that are substantially similar to the federal reserve board s guidelines 
also pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  the fdic has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as the company would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
under the fdic s regulations  the company is classified well capitalized for purposes of prompt corrective action 
shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december   an increase of million or

the precise amounts and timing of the use of the net proceeds will depend upon the company s  and subsidiaries of the company  funding requirements and the availability of other funds 
until the company uses the net proceeds from the sale of any of our securities for general corporate purposes  the company would use the net proceeds to reduce short term indebtedness or for temporary investments 
the company expects that it will  on a recurrent basis  engage in additional financings as the need arises to finance our growth  through acquisitions or otherwise  or to fund subsidiaries of the company

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the size and composition of the loan portfolio  the level of non performing and past due loans  historical trends of charged off loans and recoveries  prevailing economic conditions and other factors management deems appropriate 
the company s management has established an allowance for loan losses which it believes is adequate for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
based on a credit evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to the company s board of directors 
the review that management has developed primarily focuses on risk by evaluating the level of loans in certain risk categories 
these categories have also been established by management and take the form of loan grades 
these loan grades closely mirror regulatory classification guidelines and include pass loan categories through and special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss categories of through  respectively 
by grading the loan portfolio in this manner the company s management is able to effectively evaluate the portfolio by risk  which management believes is the most effective way to analyze the loan portfolio and thus analyze the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management also reviews charge offs and recoveries on a quarterly basis to identify trends 
the company s risk management processes include a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio 
the credit review department is independent of the loan function and reports to the executive vice president of risk management 
through the credit review process  the company maintains a classified loan watch list which  along with the delinquency report of loans  serves as a tool to assist management in assessing the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources  deterioration in underlying collateral values  or poor financial condition which may jeopardize recoverability of the debt 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans that have characteristics similar to substandard loans but have an increased risk of loss  or at least a portion of the loan may require being charged off 
loans classified as loss are those loans that are in the process of being charged off 
the allowance for loan losses is established by risk group as follows large classified loans  nonaccrual loans and loans considered impaired are evaluated individually with specific reserves allocated based on management s review 
the remainder of the portfolio is allocated a portion of the allowance based on past loss experience and the economic conditions for the particular loan category 
allocation weights are assigned based on the company s historical loan loss experience in each loan category  although a higher allocation weight may be used if current conditions indicate that loan losses may exceed historical experience 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in nonperforming and past due loans  historical loan loss experience  the existing risk of individual loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries and current economic conditions 
in november  the bank identified a problem loan relationship totaling approximately million of principal balances that was originated outside its lending policies 
the company has significant doubt about collecting the entire principal balance of the loans as a result of an evaluation of the borrowers business and prospects  the financial strength of the loan guarantors and the estimated value of the collateral securing the loans  which is less than the principal balance of the loans 
the company determined that the impairment approximated million 
the company recognized the impairment immediately and increased the provision for loan losses by the amount for the quarter ended december  the company s level of non performing assets increased marginally as of december  management established specific reserves for the accounts that contributed to this increase  requiring an increase in the allowance for loan losses relative to total loans 
while the level of non performing assets increased as of december   management anticipates that they will return to historical levels 
otherwise  management does not believe these or other factors affecting the allowance have significantly changed over the periods presented 
historically  we believe our estimates of the level of allowance for loan losses required have been appropriate and our expectation is that the primary factors considered in the provision calculation will continue to be consistent with prior trends 

table of contents the following represents the allocation of the loan loss allowance by loan category year ended december  allowance allowance allowance allowance allowance dollars in thousands commercial and industrial real estate construction real estate residential mortgage commercial real estate consumer and other allowance for loan losses percentage of respective loan types to total loans 
for the year ending december   net charge offs totaled million or of average loans outstanding for the period  net of unearned income  compared to million or in net charge offs for the same period in the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of total loans  net of unearned income at december   compared to million or of total loans at december  the increase in the allowance was primarily due to the overall growth in the loan portfolio 
with the acquisition of first colony and first national bank of johns creek  the bank acquired total loans of million and million  respectively  with related allowances for loan losses of million and million  respectively 
there were no purchase accounting adjustments made to the allowance related to these acquisitions 
the following table presents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data december  dollars in thousands average loans outstanding net of unearned income total loans  net of unearned income at year end allowance for loan losses at beginning of year provision for loan losses charge offs commercial and industrial real estate construction real estate mortgage real estate other consumer total charge offs recoveries commercial and industrial real estate construction real estate mortgage real estate other consumer total recoveries net charge offs additional allowance from acquisitions allowance for loan losses at end of period ratio of allowance to end of year loans ratio of net charge offs to average loans ratio of allowance to end of period non performing loans the company believes that the allocation of its allowance for loan losses is reasonable 
when management is able to identify specific loans or categories of loans which require specific amounts of reserve  allocations are assigned to those categories 
federal and state bank regulators also require that banks maintain a reserve that is sufficient to absorb an estimated amount of potential losses based on management s perception of economic conditions  loan portfolio growth  historical charge off experience and exposure concentrations 

table of contents the company believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio as of such date 
there can be no assurance that the company will not sustain losses in future periods  which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance for loan losses at december  the allowance for loan losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance for loan losses in comparison to a group of peer banks identified by the regulators 
during their routine examinations of banks  the fdic and the georgia department of banking and finance may require a bank to make additional provisions to its allowance for loan losses when  in the opinion of the regulators  credit evaluations and allowance for loan loss methodology differ materially from those of management 
while it is the bank s policy to charge off in the current period loans for which a loss is considered probable there are additional risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because these risks include the state of the economy  management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise 
non performing assets the company has several procedures in place to assist management in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
the company has established written guidelines contained in its lending policy for the collection of past due loan accounts 
these guidelines explain the company s policy on the collection of loans over   and days delinquent 
generally  loans over days delinquent are placed in a non accrual status 
however  if the loan is deemed to be in process of collection  it may be maintained on an accrual basis 
the company s management conducts continuous training and communicates regularly with loan officers to make them aware of its lending policy and the collection policy contained therein 
the company s management has also staffed its collection department with properly trained staff to assist lenders with collection efforts and to maintain records and develop reports on delinquent borrowers 
the company had non performing assets of million  million  and million as of december    and  respectively 
for  and  the gross amount of interest income that would have been recorded on non performing loans  if all such loans had been accruing interest at the original contract rate  was approximately   and  respectively 
the company did not have any loans that were troubled debt restructurings as defined by sfas no 
the company records real estate acquired through foreclosure at the lesser of the outstanding loan balance or the fair value at the time of foreclosure  less estimated costs to sell 
the company usually disposes of real estate acquired through foreclosure within one year  however  if it is unable to dispose of the foreclosed property  the property s value is assessed at least annually and written down to its fair value less costs to sell 
the following table presents information regarding non performing assets at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands non performing assets non accrual loans commercial and industrial real estate construction real estate mortgage real estate other consumer and other other real estate and repossessions total non performing assets loans past due days or more and still accruing ratio of past due days or more loans to loans net of unearned income ratio of non performing assets to loans  net of unearned income and other real estate interest rate sensitivity and liquidity asset liability management the company s primary market risk exposures are credit as discussed previously  interest rate risk and to a lesser degree  liquidity risk 
the bank operates under an asset liability and risk management policy approved by the board of directors of the bank through the asset and liability committee alco 
the policy outlines limits on interest rate risk 
table of contents in terms of changes in net interest income and changes in the net market values of assets and liabilities over certain changes in interest rate environments 
these measurements are made through a simulation model which projects the impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s assets and liabilities 
the policy also outlines responsibility for monitoring interest rate risk  and the process for the approval  implementation and monitoring of interest rate risk strategies to achieve the bank s interest rate risk objectives 
the bank s alco is comprised of senior officers of the bank 
the alco makes all tactical and strategic decisions with respect to the sources and uses of funds that may affect net interest income 
the alco s decisions are based upon policies established by the bank s board of directors  which are designed to meet three goals manage interest rate risk  improve interest rate spread and maintain adequate liquidity 
the alco has developed a program of action which includes  among other things  the following i selling substantially all conforming  long term  fixed rate mortgage originations  ii originating and retaining for the portfolio shorter term  higher yielding loan products which meet the company s underwriting criteria  and iii actively managing the company s interest rate risk exposure 
interest rate risk the normal course of business activity exposes the company to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed within an overall asset and liability framework for the company 
the principal objectives of asset and liability management are to guide the sensitivity of net interest spreads to potential changes in interest rates and enhance profitability in ways that promise sufficient reward for recognized and controlled risk 
funding positions are kept within predetermined limits designed to ensure that risk taking is not excessive and that liquidity is properly managed 
the company employs sensitivity analysis in the form of a net interest income simulation to help characterize the market risk arising from changes in interest rates 
in addition  fluctuations in interest rates usually result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
the company s interest rate risk position is managed by alco 
the company uses a simulation modeling process to measure interest rate risk and evaluate potential strategies 
the company s net interest income simulation includes all financial assets and liabilities 
this simulation measures both the term risk and basis risk in the company s assets and liabilities 
the simulation also captures the option characteristics of products  such as caps and floors on floating rate loans  the right to pre pay mortgage loans without penalty and the ability of customers to withdraw deposits on demand 
these options are modeled through the use of primarily historical customer behavior and statistical analysis 
other interest rate related risks such as prepayment  basis and option risk are also considered 
simulation results quantify interest risk under various interest rate scenarios 
management then develops and implements appropriate strategies 
the board of directors regularly reviews the overall rate risk position and asset and liability management strategies 
the company uses three standard scenarios rates unchanged  rising rates  and declining rates in analyzing interest rate sensitivity 
the rising and declining rate scenarios cover a basis points upward and downward rate shock 
the following table illustrates the expected effect a given interest rate shift would have on the fair market value of the balance sheet and the annualized projected net interest income of the company as of december  change in interest rates increase decrease in fmv of balance sheet increase decrease in net interest income basis points basis points these simulated computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions that management may undertake in response to future changes in interest rates 
in fiscal  the company will continue to face term risk and basis risk and may be confronted with several risk scenarios 
if interest rates rise  net interest income may actually increase if deposit rates lag increases in market rates 
the company could  however  experience significant pressure on net interest income if there is a substantial increase in deposit rates relative to market rates 
a declining interest rate environment might result in a decrease in loan rates  while deposit rates remain relatively stable  which could also create significant risk to net interest income 
alco s subcommittee  the pricing committee  meets weekly to establish interest rates on loans and deposits and review interest rate sensitivity and liquidity positions 
derivative instruments and hedging activities statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
as required by sfas  the company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 

table of contents for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings  and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings 
the company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction 
for derivatives not designated as hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
interest rate swaps are currently utilized by the company to hedge the interest rate risk associated with pools of loans that bear interest based upon the prime rate 
the interest rate swaps synthetically convert the floating interest rate payments received on pools of assets bearing interest based upon the prime rates to fixed interest receipts 
the company assesses hedge effectiveness and measures hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis for each hedging relationship 
the company performs its effectiveness testing by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the variable interest payments on each swap to the present value of the cumulative change in the overall variable receipts on the underlying loans since the inception of the hedge 
hedge ineffectiveness is recognized to the extent that the cumulative change on the swap exceeds the cumulative change on the hedged variable interest receipts on the loans 
if the ratio of the cumulative changes in the variable interest payments on a swap to the cumulative changes in the variable receipts on the underlying loans is outside of the range of to  the company considers the hedging relationship to no longer be highly effective and would dedesignate the interest rate swap from its hedging relationship 
subsequent changes in the value of the derivative would be remeasured directly through earnings 
the company s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to net interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  the company primarily uses interest rate swaps and floors as part of its cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
interest rate floors designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts over the life of the agreement if the prime interest rate decreases below a certain rate 
as of december  and  derivatives with a fair value of million and million  respectively  were included in other assets 
the change in net unrealized loss of million pretax in for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is separately disclosed in the changes of shareholders equity and comprehensive income 
in june  the company entered into a million notional interest rate floor agreement and designated the derivative as a cash flow hedge of the changes in overall cash flows associated with certain variable rate loans 
the company dedesignated this floor as a cash flow hedge in the third quarter of increases and decreases in the fair value of the dedesignated floors of thousand and thousand in and respectively  were included in interest income 
no hedging ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges was recognized during amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives is reclassified to interest income as interest payments are received on the company s variable rate loans 
the change in net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges reflects a reclassification of million pre tax and million pre tax of net unrealized gains from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest income during and  respectively 
during  the company estimates that an additional thousand will be reclassified as a decrease in interest income 
liquidity liquidity involves the company s ability to raise funds to support asset growth or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate on an ongoing basis 
during the past three years  the company s liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in core deposits  advances from federal home loan bank  and additional capital 
the company s cash and federal funds sold and cash flows from amortizing investment and loan portfolios have generally created an adequate liquidity position 
executive management reviews liquidity monthly 
this review is from a regulatory as well as static and a four quarter forecasted standpoint 
market and public confidence in the financial strength of the company and financial institutions in general will determine the company s access to supplementary sources of liquidity 
the company s capital levels and asset quality determine levels at which the company can access supplementary funding sources 
the company relies primarily on customer deposits  securities sold under repurchase agreements and shareholders equity to fund interest earning assets 
the atlanta federal home loan bank fhlb is also a major source of liquidity for the bank 
the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible collateral to satisfy their liquidity requirements 
management believes the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all reasonable borrower  depositor  and creditor needs in the present economic environment 
the company has not received any recommendations from regulatory authorities that would materially affect liquidity  capital resources or operations 

table of contents maintaining a steady funding base is achieved by diversifying funding sources  competitively pricing deposit products  and extending the contractual maturity of liabilities 
this reduces the company s exposure to roll over risk on deposits and limits reliance on volatile short term purchased funds 
short term funding needs arise from funding of loan commitments and requests for new loans and from declines in deposits or other funding sources 
the company s strategy is to fund assets to the maximum extent possible with core deposits that provide a sizable source of relatively stable and low cost funds 
core deposits include all deposits  except time deposits of  and over 
subject to certain limitations  the bank may borrow funds from the atlanta fhlb in the form of advances 
credit availability from the atlanta fhlb to the bank is based on the bank s financial and operating condition 
borrowings from the fhlb to the bank were million for term advances and million in overnight funding at december  in addition to creditworthiness  the bank must own a minimum amount of fhlb capital stock 
unused borrowing capacity at fhlb at december  was approximately million 
the bank uses fhlb advances for both long term and short term liquidity needs 
additionally  the bank has federal funds purchased lines with suntrust  first tennessee  and the bankers bank in the amount of million  million and million  respectively 
the company also has a line of credit with suntrust in the amount of million 
at december   million of the bankers bank line had been used 
there were no outstanding balances on the other lines of credit 
in december  the company raised million from the sale of  shares of common stock 
the company purchased bonds with the proceeds from this sale 
these bonds can be used as additional collateral for future borrowing capacity or sold to generate additional liquidity for the company if needed 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth the principal maturities of our material contractual obligations owing to third parties at december  in thousands total less than year years years more than years federal home loan bank overnight federal home loan bank advances federal funds purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements subordinated debt total future payments for interest and operating lease obligations to third parties at december  are as follows in thousands total less than year years years more than years federal home loan bank overnight federal home loan bank advances federal funds purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements subordinated debt operating leases total interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is a measure of exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the difference of interest earning assets less interest bearing liabilities repricing or maturing in a given period of time is commonly referred to as gap 
a positive gap indicates an excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate sensitive liabilities  a negative gap indicates an excess of interest rate sensitive liabilities over interest rate sensitive assets 
the gap analysis is prepared using either actual repricing intervals or maturity dates when stated 
loans held for sale are included in less than three months since it is management s intent to sell them within that time 
equity securities having no stated maturity are reported after five years 
in the current interest rate environment  the company s now accounts and savings deposits have been relatively insensitive to interest rate changes 
however  the company considers a portion of money market accounts to be rate sensitive based on historical growth trends and management s expectations 
shortcomings are inherent in any gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 

table of contents the following table presents the company s interest sensitivity gap between interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  volumes subject to repricing within days days days after one year total dollars in thousands interest earning assets investment securities interest bearing assets loans mortgage loans held for sale other investments federal funds sold and short term investments total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand  money market and savings deposits time deposits fhlb advances trust preferred securities federal funds purchased and other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities period gap cumulative gap period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets impact of inflation and changing prices the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the company s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  securities  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the company manages the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the net interest margin and relationship between its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
changes in interest rates will affect the volume of loans generated and the values of investment securities and collateral held 
increasing interest rates generally decrease the value of securities and collateral and reduce loan demand  especially the demand for real estate loans 
declining interest rates tend to increase the value of securities and increase the demand for loans 
other accounting matters in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  to clarify accounting and disclosure requirements relating to a guarantor s issuance of certain types of guarantees 
fin requires entities to disclose additional information about certain guarantees  or groups of similar guarantees  even if the likelihood of the guarantor s having to make any payments under the guarantee is remote 
the disclosure provisions were effective for financial statements for fiscal years ended after december  for certain guarantees  the interpretation also requires that guarantors recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the guarantee upon its issuance 
the initial recognition and measurement provision is to be applied only on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ended after december  the company plans to continue to account for stock based employee compensation under the intrinsic value based method and to provide disclosure of the impact of the fair value based method on reported income until the adoption of sfas r beginning in january employee stock options have characteristics that are significantly different from those of traded options  including vesting provisions and trading limitations that impact their liquidity 
therefore  the existing option pricing models  such as black scholes  do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of employee stock options

in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin states that if a business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise 
this interpretation explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interest in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate the entity 
fin also requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
due to the significant implementation concerns  the fasb revised interpretation no 
finr in december management has evaluated the company s investment in variable interest entities and potential variable interest entities or transactions  particularly in trust preferred securities structures because these entities constitute the company s primary exposure 
the company determined that certain trusts created by it to issue trust preferred securities required deconsolidation due to the provisions of fin r 
accordingly  as of march   the company was required to deconsolidate these trusts 
the deconsolidation required the company to remove million in trust preferred securities from its consolidated financial statements and to record junior subordinated debentures payable to these trusts of million and record the company s investment in the trusts of million in other assets 
the trust preferred securities had been counted as tier capital for regulatory purposes as minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries 
in july  the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued a supervisory letter instructing bank holding companies to continue to include the trust preferred securities in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes until further notice  even though the trusts that issued the trust preferred securities were not consolidated with their parent bank holding companies under fin on may   the federal reserve proposed changes to its capital adequacy rules that would continue to include limited amounts of qualified trust preferred securities as tier capital  notwithstanding the change in gaap resulting from fin and fin r 
currently  other than the impact described above from the deconsolidation of the trust preferred securities  the adoption of fin and fin r has not had a material impact on the financial condition or the operating results of the company

in march  the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
generally  an impairment is considered other than temporary unless i the investor has the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery of fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment  and ii evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
if impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss should be recognized equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
the recognition and measurement provisions were initially effective for other than temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after june  however  in september  the effective date of these provisions was delayed until the finalization of a fasb staff position fsp to provide additional implementation guidance 
due to the recognition and measurement provisions being suspended and the final rule delayed  we are not able to determine whether the adoption of these new provisions will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of income
