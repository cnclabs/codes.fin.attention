item management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition executive summary and note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
part item business general presidential life corporation the corporation or company is an insurance holding company that  through its wholly owned subsidiary  presidential life insurance company the insurance company  operates principally in a single reporting segment with two primary operating segments individual annuities and individual life insurance 
unless the context otherwise requires  the corporation shall be deemed to include presidential life corporation and its subsidiaries 
the corporation was founded in and  through the insurance company and the insurance company s subsidiary  the central national life insurance company of omaha cnl  is licensed to market its product in states and the district of columbia 
approximately of the insurance company s sales of annuity and life insurance products were made to individuals residing in the state of new york 
products the insurance company currently emphasizes the sale of a variety of single premium and flexible premium annuity products 
each of these products is designed to meet the needs of increasingly sophisticated consumers for supplemental retirement income and estate planning 
due to the competitive nature of the term  whole life and universal life insurance business and the negative impact of that competition on profits from such business  management decided to exit the traditional life market as of march  for at least so long as such market conditions prevail 
the insurance company will continue to service the inforce business and continue to issue the more profitable graded benefit life product 
for financial statement purposes  revenues from the sale of ordinary life insurance and annuity contracts with life contingencies are treated as revenues whereas the sale of annuity contracts without life contingencies  deferred annuities and universal life insurance products are reported as additions to policyholder s account balances 
annuity business industry wide sales of annuity products have experienced strong growth in recent years 
annuities currently enjoy an advantage over certain other savings mechanisms because the annuitant receives a tax deferred accrual of interest on his or her investment 
single premium annuity products require a one time lump sum premium payment 
during the accumulation period  the accrual of interest is on tax deferred basis to the annuitant 
single premium deferred annuities spdas provide for a single premium at time of issue  an accumulation period and an annuity payout period at some future date 
during the accumulation period  the insurance company credits the account value of the annuitant with earnings at a current interest rate that is guaranteed for periods ranging from one to six years  at the annuitants option  and that  thereafter  is subject to change based on market and other conditions 
each contract also has a minimum guaranteed rate 
the accrual of interest during the accumulation period is on a tax deferred basis to the annuitant 
after the number of years specified in the annuity contract  the annuitant may elect to take the proceeds of the annuity as a single payment  a specified income for life  or a specified income for a fixed number of years 
the annuitant is permitted at any time during the accumulation period to withdraw all or part of the single premium paid plus the amount credited to his or her account 
any such withdrawal  however  typically is subject to a surrender charge during the early years of the annuity contract 
all of the insurance company s deferred annuity products provide minimum interest rate guarantees 
these minimum guaranteed rates range from to annually and the contracts except for immediate contracts are designed to permit the insurance company to change the crediting rates annually after the initial guarantee period subject to the minimum guarantee rate 
the insurance company takes into account the profitability of its annuity business and its relative competitive position in the marketplace in determining the frequency and extent of changes to the interest crediting rate 
the insurance company s deferred annuity products are designed to encourage persistency by incorporating surrender charges that exceed the cost of issuing the policy 
an annuitant may not terminate or withdraw substantial funds for periods generally ranging from one to seven years after purchase of the annuity without incurring significant penalties in the form of surrender charges 
as of december   approximately of the insurance company s deferred annuity contracts inforce measured by reserves are subject to surrender charges 
single premium immediate productsguarantee a stream of payments  which begin immediately and continue for the life of the annuitant known as an immediate annuity or for a specified period of time known as immediate income annuity 
in an immediate annuity  the payment may be guaranteed for a period of time typically five to twenty years 
if the annuitant dies during the guarantee period  payments will continue to be made to the annuitant s beneficiary for the balance of the guarantee period 
immediate annuities differ from deferred annuities in that they generally provide for payments that begin immediately and are not subject to surrender or loan 
the implicit interest rate on immediate annuities is based on market conditions that exist at the time the annuity is issued and is guaranteed for the term of the annuity 
other annuity productsinclude structured settlement annuities  flexible premium annuities  and group terminal funding annuities 
structured settlement annuities provide an alternative to a lump sum payment or settlement in the case of a lottery or a personal injury case  as the case may be  and generally are purchased by state lottery agencies for the benefit of the lottery winner or by the property and casualty insurance companies for the benefit of the injured claimant with the benefits scheduled over a fixed period and or for the life of the annuitant 
flexible annuity products provide similar benefits to those provided by the insurance company s spda products  but instead permit periodic premium payments in such amounts as the holder deems appropriate 
group terminal funding annuity products provide benefits similar to single premium immediate annuities 
benefits are provided to employees when a company s pension plan is terminated or when the owner wants to transfer liability for making payments 
the following table presents annuity products in force measured by reserves  as well as certain statistical data for each of the years in the five fiscal year period ended december   in each case  as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap

the information below differs from the premiums shown on the corporation s consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap in that  under gaap  consideration from single premium annuity contracts without life contingencies  universal life insurance products and deferred annuities are not reported as premium revenues  but are reported as additions to policyholder account balances  which are liabilities on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet 
distribution of products by gross annuity considerations for the fiscal year ended december  dollars in thousands single premium deferreds single premium immediates other annuity considerations total annuity considerations life insurance business graded benefit life policies the only life product currently issued are products designed for the upper age ie ages  substandard applicant 
depending upon age  these products provide for a limited death benefit of either the return of premium plus interest for three years  or the return of premium plus interest for two years 
thereafter  the death benefit is limited to the face amount of the policy 
this product typically is offered with a maximum face value of  other lifeproducts inforce  but no longer being issued  include universal life  whole life  and term life 
universal life policies  flexible premium and single premium  are interest sensitive products  which typically provide the insured with non participating ie non dividend paying life insurance with a cash value 
current interest is credited to the policy s cash value based primarily upon interest rates 
in no event  however  will the interest rate credited on the policy s cash value be less then the guaranteed rate specified in the policy 
whole life policies are products that provide the insured with life insurance with a guaranteed cash value 
typically  a fixed premium  which costs more than comparable term coverage when the policyholder is younger  but less than comparable term coverage as the policyholder grows older  is paid over a period of years 
whole life insurance products combine insurance protection with a savings plan that gradually increases over a period of time  which the policyholder may borrow against 
term life policies are products that provide insurance protection if the insured dies during the time period specified in the policy 
no cash value is built up 
term life products provide the maximum benefit for the lowest initial premium outlay

the benefit must be equal  in every respect  to the minimum benefits defined in the new york disability benefits law 
the minimum benefit allowed is of the weekly earnings to a maximum of commencing on the th day of non occupation disabilities for a maximum of weeks for any one disability 
with few exceptions  employers are required to provide this coverage to their new york employees 
medical stop loss coverage is sold to employers not individual employees to cover their liabilities as incurred in the administration of self funded medical plans 
these are plans that come under erisa 
the employer does not buy a full insured plan from a carrier  but instead opts to pay the benefits for its medical plan itself 
the parameters of these benefits are spelled out in a plan document that is disseminated to employees 
the employer then purchases stop loss coverage to insure it against claims in excess of contractually designated amounts 
the coverage purchased by the employer will typically cover two types of risks to the self funded plan the risk that a claim on an individual employee exceeds a certain level  usually called the specific deductible or self insured retention 
this is known as specific stop loss coverage 
this level is usually defined in terms of dollars on a particular life 
for example  the specific deductible may be  of claims paid by the plan on any one life 
the risk that the overall claims for the plan less whatever amount is covered under the specific deductible exceeds a given level 
this is called aggregate stop loss 
the given level is usually called the aggregate attachment point 
it is typically defined by first computing the level of claims the insurer expects to occur in the given period 
to this amount is added a corridor or margin amount  which is typically 
the aggregate cover would then reimburse all claims that exceed of expected claims  exclusive of those claims reimbursed under the specific cover 
both types of plans generally have a maximum reimbursement level 
for specific claims  this generally ranges from million to million 
for aggregate claims  the coverage is generally million 
sometimes  the specific coverage is sold without the aggregate coverage 
the reverse is almost never sold 
one key aspect of stop loss coverage is that reimbursement is made to the plan  not to the individual participants 
the participants medical expenses are paid by the plan 
stop loss is insurance of the plan 
as such  only expenses covered under the plan and that are spelled out in the plan document  are covered 
the central national life insurance company of omaha on december   the corporation purchased central national life insurance company of omaha cnl from the household insurance group holding company  a subsidiary of household international  inc in june  the ownership of cnl was transferred by the corporation to the insurance company as a capital contribution and  as a result  cnl is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance company 
cnl has assets of million and capital and surplus of million as of december  and is licensed to market insurance products in states  the district of columbia  puerto rico  and the us virgin islands 
as of december   cnl had an aggregate of approximately million of policies in force  comprised of credit life  credit accident and health  life insurance and annuities 
the cnl policies are managed for the insurance company by household life insurance company  with whom all of the policies are fully reinsured 
marketing and distribution the insurance company and cnl are licensed to market insurance products in states and the district of columbia 
the insurance company distributes its annuity contracts and life insurance policies products through independent general agents of which are located in new york state 
these general agents  in turn  distribute the insurance company s products through their  licensed insurance agents or brokers most of whom also distribute similar products marketed by other insurance companies 
management believes the insurance company offers innovative products and quality service and that its product commission rates are competitive 
the new york state department of insurance nysid regulates general agent commission rates 
the independent general agent system is the insurance company s primary product distribution system 
management believes the insurance company s focus on the general agent distribution system provides cost advantages since the insurance company incurs minimal fixed costs associated with recruiting  training and maintaining agents via their general agents 
therefore  a substantial portion of the costs normally associated with product distribution is variable 
distribution costs rise and fall with the level of business 
the insurance company utilizes many general agents to distribute its products and therefore  is not dependent on any one general agent or agent for a substantial amount of its business 
on the other hand  independent general agents and agents are not captive to the company 
management believes that interest crediting rates  general agent product commission levels  annuity and life product features  company support services and perceived company financial stability help determine our competitive nature at any given point in time and influence general agents and their agents to distribute our products 
generally  the insurance company issues annuity contracts along with the general agent s commission within two business days after application receipt 
the insurance company also provides general agent support by providing direct access to the insurance company s senior executives 
annuity contract and life insurance policyholders may access information regarding their individual holdings via a toll free telephone number or contact client services department via the internet 
the insurance company s top ten general agents  as measured by combined annuity and life premiums  accounted for approximately of the insurance company s sales in no single general agent accounted for more than and no single agent accounted for more than of total sales 
management believes no single distribution source loss will have a material adverse impact on the insurance company 
however  the simultaneous loss of several distribution sources would diminish our product distribution and reduce sales unless these sources are timely replaced 
to guard against this contingency  the insurance company continuously recruits new independent general agents 
underwriting procedures since march  the only life policy the insurance company issues has been graded benefit life  a guaranteed issue product that requires no underwriting 
the maximum face amount for this product is  the insurance company continues to maintain its life inforce business and this may require additional underwriting ie reinstatements  re entries  and conversions 
in that regard  the insurance company has adopted and follows detailed  uniform underwriting procedures designed to assess and quantify insurance risks 
to the extent that a policyholder eligible for reinstatement  reentry or conversion does not meet the insurance company s underwriting standards at the standard risk classifications  the insurance company may offer to issue a classified  sub standard or impaired risk policy for a risk adjusted premium amount rather than declining the application 
the amount of the insurance company s impaired risk insurance in force in proportion to the total amount of the insurance company s individual life insurance in force was approximately at december  policy claims claims are received and reviewed by claims examiners at the insurance company s home office 
the initial review of claims includes verification that coverage is in force and that the claim is not subject to exclusion under the policy 
birth and death certificates are basic requirements 
medical records and investigative reports are ordered for contestable claims 
reinsurance the insurance company follows the usual industry practice of reinsuring ceding portions of its life insurance and medical stop loss risks with other companies  a practice that permits the insurance company to write policies in amounts larger than the risk it is willing to retain and to obtain commissions on the insurance ceded and thereby reduce its net commission expense 
the maximum amount of individual life insurance normally retained by the insurance company on any one life is  per policy and  per life 
the insurance company cedes primarily on an automatic basis  under which risks are ceded to a reinsurer on specific blocks of business where the underlying risks meet certain predetermined criteria  and on a facultative basis  under which the reinsurer s prior approval is required on each risk reinsured 
the maximum retention of the group medical stop loss business varies  but typically the insurance company cedes on a quota share basis 
use of reinsurance does not discharge an insurer from liability on the insurance ceded 
an insurer is required to pay the full amount of its insurance obligations regardless of whether it is entitled or able to receive payments from the reinsurer 
in  one of the reinsurer s for the insurance company s medical stop loss business  folksham international  filed for bankruptcy protection 
the insurance company anticipates that it will have approximately  in unpaid reinsurance claims against folksham  which is not reflected in the financial statements as of december  as of december   it is unclear how much  if any  the insurance company will collect in the bankruptcy proceeding 
at december   of the approximately  million of the company s individual life insurance in force  the insurance company had ceded to reinsurer s approximately million 
the principal reinsurance companies of individual life policies with whom the insurance company does business at december  were transamerica letter of credit and swiss re life and health america am best rating of a superior 
in  the insurance company learned that one of its independent stop loss underwriters issued certain stop loss policies in the insurance company s name without authorization and without applicable reinsurance in place 
the insurance company paid all asserted claims under those policies in in the aggregate amount of approximately million and is currently pursuing collection of this amount from the underwriter  based upon breach of contract and other claims 
competition the insurance company operates in a highly competitive environment 
there are numerous insurance companies  banks  securities brokerage firms  and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products  annuities  and other investments that compete with the insurance company  many of which are more highly rated and have substantially greater resources than the insurance company 
the insurance company believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of annuity and life insurance products are product features  commission structure  perceived stability of the insurer  claims paying rating  and service 
many other insurance and financial services companies are capable of competing for sales in the insurance company s target markets 
management believes that the insurance company s ability to compete is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to retain and attract independent general agents to market its products and to successfully develop competitive products that also are profitable 
management believes that the insurance company has good relationships with its agents  has an adequate variety of products approved for issuance and generally is competitive within the industry in all applicable areas 
investments and investment policy at december   the corporation had an aggregate of investment assets and cash of billion 
of that amount  approximately  or billion  were invested in fixed maturity bonds and notes  consisting primarily of investment grade corporate bonds billion  us government  government agencies and authorities bonds million  public utility bonds million and commercial mortgage backed securities million 
approximately million or of invested assets were invested in limited partnerships  was invested in common stock and the remainder was held as short term investments  policy loans and real estate 
investment grade corporate bonds as of december   approximately of the corporation s investment portfolio consisted of investment grade bonds 
of this amount  approximately million less than are private placements 
management believes that these bonds are marketable to other institutional investors 
all of the bonds acquired by the insurance company in private placements have been assigned a national association of insurance commissioners naic designation corresponding to one of the two highest quality rating categories 
naic designations corresponding to the entire investment portfolio can be found on page below investment grade corporate bonds as of december   the corporation held approximately million in below investment grade corporate bonds  representing approximately of the corporation s investment portfolio 
of these  approximately million are rated at the highest below grade investment level 
seventy percent of the corporation s holdings of below grade bonds were purchased at investment grade levels 
included in the below grade bond portfolios are non performing assets totaling million  or 
of total invested assets 
government bonds the corporation holds approximately million in us treasury or other government agency bonds consisting primarily of us treasury and gnma  fnma  fhlmc and fhlb obligations 
public utility bonds as of december   the corporation held million in public utility bonds  representing of investment portfolio 
approximately two thirds of the holdings represented bonds issued by the operating companies of electric and gas utilities  with the balance consisting of an assortment of electric utility holding company bonds  capital trust securities and us dollar holdings in foreign electric and water utilities 
the portfolio is diversified  with individual holdings of primarily investment grade companies 
given their large and continuing need for additional capital  public utilities are sensitive to a general rise in overall interest rates 
however  these risks are mitigated by overall economic growth  as utilities benefit by increased usage of electricity and gas and by an overall growth in their customer rate base 
collateralized debt obligations as of december   approximately million of the company s investment portfolio was invested in collateralized debt obligations cdo excluding the cdo income notes associated with the principal protected notes discussed in item management s discussion principal protected notes 
between and  the company purchased a number of cdos with a par value of million 
these are investment vehicles that issue equity and debt to finance their purchase of a wide range of fixed income assets 
most of the cdo debt purchased by the company financed the purchase of high yield bonds and bank loans 
these cdos are managed by professional portfolio managers with established track records in the relevant asset classes 
cdos are structured to provide diversification with respect to issuers  industry sector and or asset classes 
guidelines and limits regarding diversification are determined by the rating agencies and collateral managers at the start of each transaction 
while the company purchased both investment grade and non investment grade cdo debt  most of the cdo s held by the company are currently rated non investment grade as a result of large numbers of defaults and historically low recovery levels for high yield debt issued in and the company s cdo portfolio has realized losses of approximately million due to aggressively underwritten cdo transactions and a declining credit cycle 
during the past two years  however  during an improving credit cycle with low interest rates  the market value for the company s cdos now reflects an unrealized gain of approximately million as of december  the cdo portfolio was responsible for generating approximately million in annual income in the market value and level of distributed income of the cdo portfolio is expected to fluctuate with changes in interest rates and the changes in credit spreads associated with below investment grade debt 
callable agency securities the company from time to time purchases callable bonds and notes issued by one of the us government sponsored entities fnma  fhlmc  fhlb and the ffcb 
as of december   the company had a market value total of million in positions as shown below 
par value book value market value federal farm credit bank ffcb federal home loan bank fhlb freddie mac fhlmc fannie mae fnma total callable agencies frequently issue callable paper with spreads that compensate the buyer for the agencies call options and make their paper more competitive with fixed rate corporate bonds 
the company typically purchases the callable agency issues at par  or discounts to par  to insure that the yield to call is at least equal to the yield to maturity and to avoid principal loss in the event the issuer exercises its par call option 
in the event that interest rates fall and a call option is exercised  the company may be forced to reinvest at lower yields 
commercial mortgage backed securities as of december   approximately million of the company s investment portfolio was invested in mortgage backed related securities  most of which are commercial mortgage backed obligations cmbs 
mortgage backed securities are generally subject to prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of the lower current rates 
as a result  holders of mortgage backed securities may receive prepayments on their investments that cannot be reinvested at an interest rate comparable to the rate on the prepaid mortgages 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the company s investment portfolio has not been materially impacted as a result of such prepayments because it purchases such securities at prices no greater than par and the insurance company has invested primarily in mezzanine level cmbs that generally have limited prepayment risk 
these securities are collateralized by commercial mortgages which have provisions which limit loan prepayments and a security structure which further directs principal payments to the senior most outstanding security before they make such distributions to the mezzanine debt owned by the insurance company 
limited partnerships as of december   approximately million of the company s investment portfolio consisted of interests in over sixty limited partnerships  which are engaged in a variety of investment strategies  including real estate  debt restructurings  international opportunities and merchant banking 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which is mitigated by the ability of the insurance company to take annual distributions of partnership earnings 
the limited partnerships that are involved in real estate activities generally invest in real estate assets  real estate joint ventures and real estate operating companies 
these partnerships seek to achieve significant rates of return by targeting investments that provide a strategic or competitive advantage and are priced at levels that the general partner believes to be attractive 
the limited partnerships that are involved in debt restructuring activities take positions in debt and equity securities  loans originated by banks and other liabilities of financially troubled companies 
investments in companies undergoing debt restructurings  which by their nature have a high degree of financial uncertainty  may be senior  unsecured or subordinated indebtedness and carry a high characteristic of merchant banking and debt restructuring transactions 
this makes such underlying investments particularly sensitive to interest rate increases  which could affect the ability of the borrower to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its fixed charges 
the limited partnerships that are involved in international investments generally purchase sovereign debt  corporate debt  and or equity in foreign companies that are developing a greater worldwide presence 
a general partner who has demonstrated expertise in this area and the particular country involved operates such limited partnerships 
such investments involve risks related to the particular country including political instability  currency fluctuations  and repatriation restrictions 
the limited partnerships that are involved in merchant banking activities generally seek to achieve significant rates of return including capital gains through a wide variety of investment strategies  including leveraged acquisitions  bridge financing  and other private equity investments in existing businesses 
the insurance company has been investing in limited partnerships for over sixteen years 
during this time  the insurance company has had an opportunity to consider and evaluate a substantial number of limited partnerships and their managers 
the insurance company makes limited partnership investments based on a number of considerations  including the reputation  investment philosophy particularly with respect to risk  performance history and investment strategy of the manager of the limited partnership 
managers of the limited partnerships in which the insurance company is invested include  among others  blackstone investment management  starwood capital  goldman sachs partners  trust company of the west asset management  clayton dubilier rice partners  apollo real estate and fortress investment group 
limited partnership investments are selected through a careful  two stage review process 
the investment analyst staff reviews the offering documents and performance history of each investment manager 
separately  the investment committee interviews the manager to determine whether the investment philosophy particularly with respect to risk and strategies of the limited partnership are in the best interests of the insurance company 
only after both the investment analyst staff and the investment committee make a positive recommendation does the insurance company invest in a limited partnership 
in addition  the actions of the investment committee are subject to review and approval by the board of directors of the corporation or the insurance company  as the case may be 
to evaluate both the carrying value and the continuing appropriateness of the company s investment in any limited partnership  management maintains ongoing discussions with the investment manager and considers the limited partnership s operations  current and near term projected financial condition  earnings capacity and distributions received by the insurance company during the year 
pursuant to the terms of certain limited partnership agreements to which the insurance company is a party  the insurance company is committed to contribute  if called upon  an aggregate of approximately million of additional capital to certain of these limited partnerships 
million in commitments will expire in  million in  million in  million in and million in the book value of the corporation s investments in limited partnerships as of december   and was approximately million  million and million respectively 
net investment income derived from the insurance company s interests in limited partnership investments aggregated approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
management anticipates that in the future it will continue to make selective investments in limited partnerships as opportunities arise  subject to the approval of the chief investment officer and the investment committee and the review and approval by the board of directors of the insurance company  as the case may be 
there can be no assurance that the insurance company will continue to achieve the same level of returns on its investments in limited partnerships that it has received during the foregoing periods or that it will achieve any returns on such investments at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will receive a return of all or any portion of its current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of returns on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the insurance company s financial condition and results of operations 
other as of december   the company s investment portfolio also consisted of approximately million invested in preferred stock  and approximately million invested in common stock 
the company s only direct real estate investments are two buildings in nyack  new york  which are used as the current home office of the insurance company  and two acres of undeveloped land in nyack  new york 
as of may  the company no longer participates in dollar roll repurchase agreement transactions 
in fiscal and  dollar roll transactions generated approximately 
million and million  respectively  of net investment income for the company

insurance regulation general regulation as an insurance holding company  the corporation is subject to regulation by the state of new york  where the insurance company is domiciled  as well as all other states where the insurance company transacts business 
most states have enacted legislation that requires each insurance company in a holding company system to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile and furnish to it financial and other information concerning the operations of the companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
the corporation has registered as a holding company system in new york 
the laws and regulations of new york applicable to insurance holding companies require  among other things  that all transactions within a holding company system be fair and equitable and that charges for services be equitable 
in addition  many transactions require prior notification to or approval of the superintendent of insurance of the state of new york the superintendent 
prior written approval of the superintendent is required for the direct or indirect acquisition of or more of the insurance companies voting securities 
applicable state insurance laws  rather than federal bankruptcy laws  also apply to the liquidation or reorganization of insurance companies 
the insurance company is subject to regulation and supervision by the insurance regulatory agencies of the states in which it is authorized to transact business 
state insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers 
principal among these powers are granting and revoking licenses to transact business  regulate marketing and other trade practices  operating guaranty associations  licensing agents  approving policy forms  regulating premium rates  regulating insurance holding company systems  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and reports  performing financial  market conduct and other examinations  determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus  defining acceptable accounting principles  regulating the type  valuation and amount of investments permitted  and limiting the amount of dividends that can be paid and the size of transactions that can be consummated without first obtaining regulatory approval 
one of the requirements is that the insurance company performs annual cash flow testing of its assets and liabilities 
based on the testing performed as of december   the insurance company established an asset liability reserve of million 
this is a statutory reserve only 
the reserve deals with the risk of a substantial increase in surrenders in a rising interest rate environment 
during the last decade  the insurance regulatory framework has been placed under increased scrutiny by various states  the federal government  and the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
various states have considered or enacted legislation that changes  and in many cases increases  the states authority to regulate insurance companies 
legislation was passed in congress that could result in the federal government assuming some role in the regulation of insurance companies and allowing combinations among insurance companies  banks  and other entities 
in recent years  the naic has approved and recommended to the states for adoption and implementation several regulatory initiatives designed to reduce the risk of insurance company insolvencies and market conduct violations 
these initiatives include investment reserve requirements  risk based capital standards  codification of insurance accounting principles  new investment standards  and restrictions on an insurance company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders 
all of these have had and will continue to have a material impact on the conduct of the company s business 
the insurance company is required to file detailed periodic reports and financial statements with the state insurance regulators in each of the states in which it does business 
in addition  insurance regulators periodically examine the insurance company s financial condition  adherence to statutory accounting practices and compliance with the insurance department rules and regulations 
as part of their routine regulatory oversight process  the new york state insurance department nysid generally conducts detailed examinations every three years of the books  records and accounts of the insurance company 
the insurance company s most recent examination occurred during for the three year period ending december  to date  the nysid has not issued its report with respect to that examination 
regulation of dividends and other payments from the insurance company the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no other business operations  its primary sources of cash needed to meet its obligations  including principal and interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness and dividend payments on its common stock  are rent from its real estate  income from its investments  and dividends from the insurance company 
the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans or cash advances  that it may make to company without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under new york law  the insurance company is permitted without prior insurance regulatory clearance  to pay a stockholder dividend to the company as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its surplus as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year  or ii its net gain after tax from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year 
any dividend in excess of such amount is subject to approval by the superintendent 
the superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders 
the nysid has established informal guidelines for such determinations 
the guidelines focus on  among other things  an insurer s overall financial condition and profitability under statutory accounting practices 
statutory accounting practices differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap 
the significant differences relate to deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred income taxes  required investment reserves and reserve calculation assumptions 
management of the company cannot provide assurance that the insurance company will have adequate statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the company in an amount sufficient to fund the company s cash requirements  including the payment of dividends  or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
the insurance company paid no dividends to the company in fiscal  or investment reserves asset valuation reserve statutory accounting practices require a life insurance company to maintain an asset valuation reserve avr to absorb realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on a portion of an insurer s fixed income securities and equity securities 
the avr is required to stabilize statutory surplus from fluctuations in the market value of bonds  stocks  mortgages  real estate  and other invested assets 
the maximum avr is calculated based on the application of various factors that are applied to the assets in the insurer s portfolio 
the avr generally captures credit related realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on such assets 
each year the amount of an insurer s avr will fluctuate as the investment portfolio changes and capital gains and losses are absorbed by the reserve 
to adjust for such changes over time  contributions must be made to the avr in an aggregate amount equal to of the difference between the maximum avr as calculated and the actual avr 
these contributions may result in a slower rate of growth in or a reduction of the insurance company s unassigned surplus 
the extent of the impact of the avr on the insurance company s surplus depends in part on the future composition of the insurance company s investment portfolio 
interest maintenance reserve the interest maintenance reserve imr captures capital gains and losses net of taxes on fixed income investments primarily bonds and mortgage loans resulting from interest rate changes  which are amortized into net income over the estimated remaining periods to maturity of the investments sold 
the extent of the impact of the imr depends on the amount of future capital gains and losses on fixed maturity investments resulting from interest rate changes 
naic iris ratios the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and primarily is intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies industry ratios and specifies normal ranges for each ratio 
the iris ratios were designed to advise state insurance regulators of significant changes in an insurance company s product mix  larges reinsurance transactions  increases or decreases in premium received  and certain other changes in operations 
these changes need not result from any problems with an insurance company but merely indicate changes in certain ratios outside ranges defined as normal by the naic 
when an insurance company has four or more ratios falling outside normal ranges  state regulators may  but are not obligated to  inquire of the company regarding the nature of the company s business to determine the reasons for the ratios being outside the normal range 
no regulatory significance results from being out of the normal range on fewer than four of the ratios 
for the year ended december   two ratios fell outside the normal range 
one ratio net income to total income resulted in a ratio of 
any result below zero is considered outside the normal range 
this result is attributable to the other than temporary impairments the insurance company realized in on certain principal protected notes in its portfolio as a result of the restatement of its financial statements 
see item management s discussion and analysis executive summary and note to the consolidated financial statements included at item 
the other ratio  change in reserve ratio life resulted in a ratio of and is considered outside the normal range 
this result is attributable to the insurance company discontinuing the sale of its universal life products in early  as well as  the increase in the life reserves was down dramatically from the prior year 
risk based capital under the naic s risk based capital formula  insurance companies must calculate and report information under a risk based capital formula 
the standards require the computation of a risk based capital amount  which then is compared to a company s actual total adjusted capital 
the computation involves applying factors to various financial data to address four primary risks asset default  adverse insurance experience  disintermediation and external events 
this information is intended to permit insurance regulators to identify and require remedial action for inadequately capitalized insurance companies  but is not designed to rank adequately capitalized companies 
the naic formula provides for four levels of potential involvement by state regulators for inadequately capitalized insurance companies  ranging from a requirement for an insurance company to submit a plan to improve its capital company action level to regulatory control of the insurance company mandatory control level 
at december   the insurance company s company action level was million and the mandatory control level was million 
the insurance company s adjusted capital at december  and was million and million  respectively  which exceeds all four action levels 
assessments against insurers most applicable jurisdictions require insurance companies to participate in guaranty funds  which are designed to indemnify policyholders of insolvent insurance companies 
insurers authorized to transact business in these jurisdictions generally are subject to assessments based on annual direct premiums written in that jurisdiction 
these assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer s insolvency and  in certain instances  may be offset against future state premium taxes 
the amount of these assessments against the insurance company in and prior years have not been material 
however  the amount and timing of any future assessment against the insurance company under these laws cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond the control of the company and the insurance company 
as such  no reasonable estimate of such assessments can be made 
regulation at federal level although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways 
current and any future federal measures that may significantly affect the insurance business include limitations on antitrust immunity  minimum solvency requirements  and the removal of barriers restricting banks from engaging in the insurance and mutual fund business 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such congressional activity or the potential effects thereof on the corporation

in addition  the corporation consolidates the issuers of principal protected note investments due to a majority ownership percentage of the notes issued by those issuers and its unilateral ability to cause the liquidation of these issuers

in and the general economic recession caused a severe deterioration in many investment grade companies such as owens corning  mci worldcom  pacific gas and electric  southern california edison  us airways and sunbeam 
while some actually went bankrupt  many others lost their investment grade debt ratings with resulting market declines 
the insurance company s investment portfolio realized losses from sales and from recognition of other than temporary impairment charges  with the result that net losses were encountered in and in  these losses were million with an increase to a loss of million in a corollary impact of these was that capital ratios were adversely affected in both years 
recoveries in the market values were experienced  which resulted in the corporation achieving record high levels of capital and improved capital ratios 
as described under ratings and regulation  the corporation s business is substantially affected by such capital ratios and their impact on its rating 
consequently  the insurance company s management established a policy of reducing the level of sales increases until capital and surplus ratios are further improved 
sales will also be made with a greater selectivity based on a profit review 
the insurance company has determined that the level of competition in the sale of traditional and universal life insurance products has made it very difficult for smaller insurance companies  such as the insurance company  to participate in this business in a profitable way 
accordingly  the insurance company has determined that  under the current market conditions  it will not participate in the sale of traditional and universal life policies 
earnings from core assets have been and are expected to be affected by the decline in interest rates 
net investment return on assets for increased  however  due to the strong performance of the insurance company s limited partnership investments 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations explanatory statement this annual report reflects the restatement of the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and december  to consolidate the financial statements of the issuers of certain principal protected note investments made by the company and to apply the provisions of eitf recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitized financial assets in accounting for the variable income notes now included as separate investments in the company s financial statements as a result of the restatement  and the remaining principal protected notes for which the financial statements of the related issuers have not been consolidated 
these corrections resulted in significant changes in dac amortization and deferred income taxes 
the restatement of the financial statements also incorporates the cumulative impact as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for of the restatement from the dates of purchase of such principal protected note investments  which range from to general the insurance company is engaged in the sale of insurance products with three primary lines of business individual annuities  individual life insurance  and group accident and health 
revenues are derived primarily from premiums received from the sale of annuity contracts  life and accident and health products  and gains or losses  from our investment portfolio 
for financial statement purposes  our revenues from the sale of whole life and term life insurance products and annuity contracts with life contingencies are treated differently from our revenues from the sale of annuity contracts without life contingencies  deferred annuities and universal life insurance products 
premiums from the sale of whole or term life insurance products and life contingency annuities are reported as premium income on our financial statements 
premiums from the sale of deferred annuities  universal life insurance products and annuities without life contingencies are not reported as premium revenues  but rather are reported as additions to policyholders account balances 
from these products  revenues are recognized over time in the form of policy fee income  surrender charges and mortality and other charges deducted from policyholders account balances 
profitability in the insurance company s individual annuities  individual life insurance and group accident and health depends largely on the size of its inforce block  the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting discipline  and the efficiency of its claim and expense management 
unless specifically stated otherwise  all references to  and refer to our fiscal years ended  or the dates  as the context requires  december   december  and december   respectively

in this discussion  we have included statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events  many of which  by their nature  are inherently uncertain and beyond our control 
these statements may relate to our future plans and objectives 
by identifying these statements for you in this manner  we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ  possibly materially  from results indicated in these forward looking statements 
important factors  among others  that could cause our results to differ from those indicated in the forward looking statements are discussed under certain factors that may affect our business 
executive overview restatement the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement of the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and as described in note to such financial statements included in item  of part ii  of this form k 
the restatement is due to the corporation s determination that the issuers of certain principal protected notes purchased by the corporation are required to be consolidated with the corporation s results from the dates that such notes were purchased by the insurance company 
as a result of the consolidation  the principal protected notes previously recorded by the corporation are eliminated and the corporation records the individual assets of the issuers of the principal protected notes the underlying variable rate income notes and us treasury strips or similar instruments and applies applicable accounting standards to these underlying assets  including the provisions of eitf with respect to the variable income notes 
in addition  in connection with the restatement the corporation has applied the provisions of eitf to other principal protected note investments whose issuers are not required to be consolidated 
although the corporation has a demonstrated ability and intention to hold these instruments to maturity until recovery of fair value at or above cost and does not have the ability to cause the liquidation of the issuers of those instruments  the corporation has deemed it appropriate to apply the provisions of eitf in accounting for these instruments to present consistent accounting treatment for all of its principal protected note investments  regardless of whether consolidation is required 
the effect of the restatement on the corporation s financial statements is summarized as follows the variable rate income notes underlying all of the corporation s principal protected notes investments are included in the corporation s balance sheet and have been assessed for impairment 
the notes deemed to have been other than temporarily impaired have been written down to fair value through the income statement 
previously  the impairment of the principal protected notes was recorded as an unrealized loss and included under accumulated other comprehensive gain loss on the corporation s balance sheet 
the us treasury strips are recorded at cost on the date of purchase and amortization of the discount on those instruments is recorded as interest income in subsequent periods 
the aforementioned other than temporary impairment charges and amortization of discount on the treasury strips impact gross profits in each of the affected years and  therefore  affect deferred policyholder acquisition cost amortization and deferred tax amounts in such years 
deferred acquisition costs and related amortization also involved a correction with regard to the application of the company s methodology for applying unrealized gains and loss information in connection with its shadow dac calculation 
results earnings per share were for  as compared to in and a loss of in results in reflected a continuing of year to year increases in investment income and net realized investment gains from the prior years 
our total revenues in were million  compared to million in and million in the corporation s performance in resulted primarily from the improved performance of the investment portfolio  particularly the investments in limited partnerships 
the improvement of global capital and equity markets in also contributed significantly to our financial performance 
certain factors that may affect our business there are numerous factors  some of which are outside our control  which could have a material impact on our business 
these factors include market conditions  legal and regulatory changes and operational risk 
a summary of these factors is set below market conditions the corporation  like all companies  is affected by the general state of financial markets and economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
despite certain recent improvements in business conditions  the business environment in recent years has been difficult and the ability to obtain desired returns on the investment portfolio without exposing the corporation to excess risk has been challenging 
this  in turn  has had an impact on our willingness to expand sale of our single premium annuity products 
legal and regulatory risk as an insurance company  we are subject to substantial regulatory control 
any material change in the framework in which we operate could have a material impact on the business 
for further discussion on how we deal with the regulatory requirements  see business insurance regulation 
operational risk business is dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis our payment obligations under outstanding policies and the condition of the investment portfolio 
any internal failures in the internal processes  people  or systems could lead to adverse consequences to the corporation 
in addition  despite the contingency plans in place  the ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by the disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the community in which we are located 
interest rate risk the insurance company s principal products are deferred annuities  which are interest rate sensitive instruments 
in an interest rate environment of falling or stable rates  as has persisted in recent years  the insurance company s annuity holders are less likely to seek to surrender their annuities prior to maturity to seek alternative  higher yielding investments 
however  in an environment of moderately or significantly increasing rates  such surrenders should be expected to increase 
the existence currently of surrender fees on approximately of the insurance company s outstanding deferred annuities acts as a deterrent against surrenders 
however  if interest rates climb sufficiently  such fees may not have a significant deterrent effect 
moreover  the surrender fees are only in effect for up to the first years of each annuity policy and  therefore  disappear over time see table below 
in the event of a substantial increase in surrenders during a short period of time  the insurance company may have to sell off longer term assets to pay current surrender liabilities 
the insurance company continually develops strategies to address the match between the timing of its assets and liabilities 
to that end  it is currently reducing the amount of assets invested in longer term investments and reinvesting in short and intermediate return investments at reduced yields 
these reduced yields are partially offset by the gains being recognized by the insurance company from the sale of the long term assets 
the insurance company is also benefiting in this regard from the consolidation of the issuers of the principal protected note investments in its investment portfolio  which has placed into the insurance company s investment portfolio a par value of approximately million in us treasury strips and similar instruments with maturity dates commencing in account value with surrender charges expiring year expiring account value in millions percent of account value expiring and later total pricing management believes that the insurance company is able to offer its products at competitive prices to its targeted markets as a result of i maintaining relatively low issuance costs by selling through the independent general agency system  ii minimizing home office administrative costs  and iii utilizing appropriate underwriting guidelines 
the long term profitability of sales of life and most annuity products depends on the degree of margin of the actuarial assumptions that underlie the pricing of such products 
actuarial calculations for such products  and the ultimate profitability of sales of such products  are based on four major factors i persistency  ii rate of return on cash invested during the life of the policy or contract  iii expenses of acquiring and administering the policy or contract  and iv mortality 
persistency is the rate at which insurance policies remain in force  expressed as a percentage of the number of policies remaining in force over the previous year 
policyholders sometimes do not pay premiums  thus  causing their policies to lapse 
ratio of annualized voluntary terminations surrenders and lapses to mean life insurance in force the assumed rate of return on invested cash and desired spreads during the period that insurance policies or annuity contracts are in force also affects pricing of products and currently includes an assumption by the insurance company of a specified rate of return and or spread on its investments for each year that such insurance or annuity product is in force 
investment results the following table summarizes the insurance company s investment results for the periods indicated  as determined in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  dollars in thousands cash and total invested assets net investment income effective yield net realized investment gains losses average of cash and aggregate invested amounts at the beginning and end of period 
net investment income is net of investment expenses and excludes capital gains and losses and provision for income taxes 
net investment income divided by average cash and total invested assets minus net investment income 
net realized investment gains losses include provisions for impairment in value that are considered other than temporary and exclude provisions for income taxes 
the reduction in the net investment income ratios from to was attributable to the low interest rate environment and other economic conditions 
during periods of declining interest rates  paydowns on mortgage backed securities with higher interest rates and callable debt securities increase 
during such periods  the insurance company will likely not be able to reinvest the proceeds at comparable yields 
another major factor affecting profitability is the level of expenses 
management believes that one of the insurance company s strengths is its concentration on minimizing expenses through periodic review and adjustment of general and administrative costs 
investments the insurance company derives a predominant portion of its total revenues from investment income 
the insurance company manages most of its investments internally 
all investments made on behalf of the insurance company are governed by the general requirements and guidelines established and approved by the insurance company s investment committee the investment committee and by qualitative and quantitative limits prescribed by applicable insurance laws and regulations 
the investment committee meets regularly to set and review investment policy and to approve current investment plans 
the actions of the investment committee are subject to review and approval by the board of directors of the corporation and the insurance company 
the insurance company s investment policy must comply with nysid regulations and the regulations of other applicable regulatory bodies 
the insurance company s investment philosophy generally focuses on purchasing investment grade securities with the intention of holding such securities to maturity 
however  as market opportunities  liquidity  or regulatory considerations may dictate  securities may be sold prior to maturity 
the insurance company has categorized all fixed maturity securities as available for sale and carries such investments at market value 
the insurance company manages its investment portfolio to meet the diversification  yield and liquidity requirements of its insurance policy and annuity contract obligations 
the insurance company s liquidity requirements are monitored regularly so that cash flow needs are satisfied 
adjustments periodically are made to the insurance company s investment policies to reflect changes in the insurance company s short and long term cash needs  as well as changing business and economic conditions 
the insurance company seeks to manage its investment portfolio in part to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  and our net investment income increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
for example  if interest rates decline  the insurance company s fixed maturity investments generally will increase in market value  while net investment income will decrease as fixed income investments mature or are sold and proceeds are reinvested at the declining rates  and vice versa 
management is aware that prevailing market interest rates frequently shift and  accordingly  has adopted strategies that are designed to address either an increase or decrease in prevailing rates 
the insurance company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
management evaluates whether other than temporary impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the insurance company in the other than temporary impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi consistency with accounting treatment applicable to other similarly situated investments  and vii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on valuation methodologies  securities the insurance company deems to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that the assumptions relied upon by the insurance company will yield accurate assessments of the fair value of these investments 
as such  the insurance company reassesses its assumptions regularly 
as of december   approximately of the insurance company s total invested assets were invested in limited partnerships and equity securities 
investments in limited partnerships are included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet under the heading other invested assets 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the insurance company is committed  if called upon during a specified period  to contribute an aggregate of approximately million of additional capital to certain of these limited partnerships 
million in  million in  in  in and in the insurance company may make selective investments in additional limited partnerships as opportunities arise 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which is mitigated by the ability of the insurance company to take annual distributions of partnership earnings 
there can be no assurance that the insurance company will continue to achieve the same level of returns on its investments in limited partnerships as it has historically 
further  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will receive a return of all or any portion of its current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of return on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the primary market risks in the insurance company s investment portfolio are interest rate risk and  to a lesser degree  equity price risk 
the insurance company s exposure to foreign exchange risk is not significant 
the insurance company has no direct commodity risk 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact the corporation s profitability 
in certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile  the insurance company could be exposed to disintermediation risk asset liability mismatch and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margin 

see interest rate risk above 
unrealized losses the following table presents the amortized cost and gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities and common stock where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost at december  less than months months or more total fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses description of securities in thousands us treasury obligations and direct obligations of us government agencies corporate bonds preferred stocks subtotal fixed maturities common stock total the following table presents the total gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by december  gross unrealized losses of total in thousands less than twelve months twelve months or more total principal protected notes as has been previously reported  between and  the insurance company made a series of investments in instruments known as principal protected notes 
these notes  marketed by investment companies  consist of an investment in a trust unit or corporate note 
the trusts contain two assets  a variable rate income note issued by a collateralized debt obligation structure and a aaa rated zero coupon security  primarily us treasury strips  with maturity dates no later than the variable rate income note and a face value equal to the principal amount of the investment in the principal protected note 
the us treasury strip is designed to defease the principal amount of the investment  while the variable rate income note provides periodic distributions of cash flow when sufficient cash flow is generated by the collateralized debt obligation structure 
in february  the insurance company determined that due to its percentage ownership of the notes of certain of the issuers of the principal protected note investments it purchased  the issuers were actually deemed to be affiliated parties 
this required the issuers to be consolidated with the corporation 
the impact of the consolidation is that the corporation is required to account separately for the variable rate income note and the us treasury strips 
commencing in or about through  many of the variable income rate notes underlying the insurance company s principal protected note investment  ceased paying periodic income 
as part of the restatement  the corporation recorded the impairment of the notes as unrealized losses 
the effects on the corporation s financial statements are as follows the impairment of the variable rate income notes is treated as a realized loss as of the date the corporation determined they were other than temporarily impaired 
in most instances  that occurred during this resulted in a cumulative increase in realized capital loss at december  in the amount of million and such cumulative capital loss was recorded as a reduction of retained earnings as of january  this was offset substantially by a reduction of unrealized losses as of the same dates and a corresponding increase in other comprehensive income 
see selected financial data on page 
in addition  in connection with the restatement the corporation has applied the provisions of eitf to certain principal protected note investments  whose issuers are not required to be consolidated 
although the corporation has a demonstrated ability and intention to hold these instruments to maturity until recovery of fair value at or above cost and does not have the ability to cause the liquidation of the issuers of those instruments  the corporation has deemed it appropriate to apply the provisions of eitf in accounting for these instruments to present consistent accounting treatment for all principal protected note investments  regardless of whether consolidation is required the us treasury strips are recorded as investments at their purchase price when purchased 
in each subsequent year  the corporation has recognized substantial additional income due to the accretion of the value of the treasury strips as they move towards maturity  recorded as amortization of the original issue discount for the bonds 
through december   this additional pre tax income amounted to million 
in subsequent periods  running through maturity of the bonds  the corporation is expecting to recognize additional income of approximately million 
agency ratings ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position in the insurance and financial services marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the corporation s or the insurance company s ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
in the event the ratings are downgraded  the level of revenues or the persistency of the insurance company s business may be adversely impacted 
in january  am best company affirmed the insurance company s rating at b very good 
publications of am best indicate that the b rating is assigned to those companies that  in am best s opinion  have achieved a very good overall performance when compared to the norms of the insurance industry and that generally have demonstrated a good ability to meet their respective policyholder and other contractual obligations over a long period of time 
in evaluating a company s statutory financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity  as well as the company s book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its reserves and the experience and competency of its management 
am best s rating is based on factors which primarily are relevant to policyholders  agents and intermediaries and is not directed towards the protection of investors  nor is it intended to allow investors to rely on such a rating in evaluating the financial condition of the insurance company 
during  moody s investor services moody s lowered the insurance company s insurance financial strength rating from baa to ba questionable financial security 
standard poor s corporation standard poor s lowered the insurance company s insurance financial strength from a to bb which is defined as less vulnerable in the near term but faces major ongoing uncertainties to adverse business  financial and economic conditions 
the credit rating of the corporation s senior notes  due february  the senior notes  was lowered to a b more vulnerable to adverse business  financial and economic conditions but currently has the capacity to meet financial requirements from a bbb by standard poor s and to a b poor financial security from ba by moody s 
in may  moody s lowered this rating to b  but raised the outlook on the rating from negative to stable 
the downgrades did not have a material impact on the financial statements of the corporation for the reduction in sales was primarily attributable to management s intention to preserve and build the insurance company s capital and surplus ratios 
surrenders of the insurance company s annuity products continue to remain below of the surrenderable annuities and have not had a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year and fiscal year to fiscal year operating revenues annuity considerations and life insurance premiums total annuity considerations and life insurance premiums decreased to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately and decreased from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately 
these decreases are attributable to a decrease in sales of the insurance company s single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies 
annuity considerations decreased to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately million and from approximately million in to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
in accordance with gaap  sales of single premium deferred annuities are not reported as annuity considerations  but rather as additions to policyholder account balances 
based on statutory accounting  revenue from sales of single premium annuities were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease from is attributable to many factors  primarily management s intent to reduce sales to preserve and build the insurance company s capital and surplus ratios 
policy fee income universal life and investment type policy fee income was approximately million in fiscal  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately 
million in fiscal the increase in is attributed to an increased number of life policies surrendered during that were within the surrender charge period 
policy fee income consists principally of amounts assessed during the period against policyholders account balances for mortality charges and surrender charges 
net investment income net investment income totaled million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal this represents a increase comparing fiscal to fiscal and a increase comparing fiscal to fiscal the increases from to and from to were largely attributable to an increase in investment income from the insurance company s limited partnership investments 
income from these investments amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the full impact of the increase in sales in was reflected in the increase in fixed maturity income for and income from fixed maturities totaled million in compared to million in and in the insurance company s ratio of net investment income to average cash and invested assets less net investment income for the years ended december   and was approximately  and  respectively 
without taking into account the corporation s returns on its limited partnership investments in those years  the respective ratios would have been  and for the years ended december   and for additional information  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during periods of declining interest rates  pay downs on mortgage backed securities with higher interest rates and callable debt securities increase 
during such periods the insurance company  for the most part  will not likely be able to reinvest the proceeds at comparable yields 
net realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains pre tax amounted to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal and a loss of approximately million in fiscal net realized investment gains losses for years ended december   and include realized investment losses of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  attributable to writedowns of certain securities contained in the insurance company s investment portfolio 
investment securities with unrealized losses are placed on an internal watch list and are carefully evaluated to determine whether such losses are other than temporary 
evaluations of watch list securities are monitored on an ongoing basis 
various criteria are utilized in the evaluation of the financial performance of the issuer  including capital structure  debt maturities  earnings trends  asset quality  industry trends  regional and economic trends and specific events including a company specific event  such as missed interest payments  accounting issues  gain or loss of major revenue generating contract s  significant change in availability and cost of raw material or labor  and  b specific market driven events such as dramatic changes in interest rates or geo political events 
we then evaluate these results in the context of our general intent to hold the investments to maturity barring any significant adverse change in credit conditions  as well as our need for liquidity 
when we determine that such conditions are not simply temporary  we adjust the book value to reflect the net realizable value or fair value  as appropriate  on a quarterly basis 
realized investment gains losses also result from sales of certain equities and convertible securities  and calls and sales of fixed maturity investments in the insurance company s investment portfolio 
total benefits and expenses interest credited and benefits to policyholders interest credited and benefits to policyholders amounted to approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal this represents a decrease of approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal and approximately a decrease comparing fiscal to fiscal the decreases in from and from were primarily attributable to varying levels of policyholder account balances as a result of variations in annuity considerations received and surrenders paid during the respective years  as well as a reduction of the interest rates credited on renewals 
the insurance company s average credited rates for reserves and account balances for the months ended december   and were less than the insurance company s ratio of net investment income to mean assets for the same periods as noted above under net investment income 
there can be no assurance that the spread between the insurance company s average credited rate for reserves and account balances and the insurance company s ratio of net investment income to mean assets the spread  will not decline in future periods or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
interest expense on notes payable the interest expense on the corporation s notes payable amounted to approximately million in fiscal  approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal is attributable to higher interest rates on the corporation s million line of credit with the bank of new york and lower interest rates in fiscal when comparing to fiscal general expenses  taxes and commissions general expenses  taxes and commissions to agents totaled approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal this represents a decrease of approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal and a decrease of approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal is attributable to a reduction in the insurance company s general expenses due to expense controls initiated in the decrease in fiscal compared to  is principally attributable to lower costs associated with lower commissions and selling expenses incurred associated with the lower level of sales of single premium annuities offset by the corporation s general expenses and taxes 
change in deferred policy acquisition costs the change in the net dac for the twelve months ended december  resulted in a charge of approximately million  as compared to credits of approximately million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
such changes are due in part to the costs associated with product sales that have been deferred accounting for credits of approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal 
another portion of such changes is due to amortization of the dac on deferred annuity business  which reflects the impact that changes in estimated gross profits have on these unamortized deferred acquisition costs 
such changes accounted for charges of approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal and a credit of approximately million in fiscal the balance of the changes is due to the amortization of the dac for the remainder of the business accounting for charges of approximately million for fiscal  approximately million for fiscal and approximately million in fiscal 
under applicable accounting rules fasb  dac related to deferred annuities is amortized in proportion to the estimated gross profits over the estimated lives of the contracts 
essentially  as estimated profits of the insurance company related to these assets increase  the amount and timing of amortization is accelerated 
in and  the insurance company had significant realized investment losses  leading to substantially increased credits against dac amortization in those years 
in and  the insurance company s investment performance was substantially improved from the prior years  resulting in charges to dac amortization

income before income taxes for the reasons discussed above  income loss before income taxes amounted to approximately million in fiscal  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal income taxes income tax expense was approximately million for fiscal  as compared to an expense of approximately million for fiscal and a benefit of approximately million in fiscal the increase in income taxes in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in investment income as compared to the increase in from is primarily attributable to the net investment losses the company realized in fiscal of approximately as compared to a net investment gain of approximately million in fiscal net income for the reasons discussed above  the corporation had net income of approximately million in fiscal  as compared to net income of approximately million in fiscal and a net loss of approximately million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the corporation is an insurance holding company and its primary uses of cash are debt service obligations  operating expenses and dividend payments 
the corporation s principal sources of cash are sales of and interest on the corporation s investments and rent from its real estate 
during  the corporation s board of directors maintained the quarterly dividend rate of 
per share 
during and  the corporation did not repurchase any of its common stock  although at december   the corporation was authorized to purchase approximately  shares of common stock 
the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans or cash advances that it may make to us without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under the new york insurance law  the insurance company is permitted without prior insurance regulatory clearance to pay a stockholder dividend to the corporation as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its surplus as of the immediately preceding calendar year and ii its net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year excluding realized capital gains and losses 
the insurance company will be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend to the corporation in excess of that amount if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the superintendent and the superintendent does not disapprove the distribution 
management of the corporation cannot provide assurance that the insurance company will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the corporation in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
the insurance company paid no dividends to the corporation in fiscal  or notwithstanding the above  the corporation was able to meet all its liquidity needs in  including the payment of dividends  and anticipates being able to meet those needs in principal sources of funds at the insurance company are premiums and other considerations paid  net investment income received and proceeds from investments called  redeemed or sold 
the principal uses of these funds are the payment of benefits on annuity contracts and life insurance policies including withdrawals and surrender payments  the payment of policy acquisition costs  operating expenses and the purchase of investments 
given the insurance company s historical cash flow and current financial results  management believes that  for the next twelve months and for the reasonably foreseeable future  the insurance company s cash flow from operating activities will provide sufficient liquidity for the operations of the insurance company 
net cash provided by the insurance company s operating activities was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase from is largely attributable to the increase in net investment income for fiscal net cash used provided by in the insurance company s investing activities principally reflecting investments purchased less investments called  redeemed or sold was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
for purposes of the corporation s consolidated statements of cash flows  financing activities relate primarily to sales and surrenders of the insurance company s annuity and universal life insurance products 
the payment of dividends by the corporation to its stockholders is also considered to be a financing activity 
net cash provided by used by the insurance company s financing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these fluctuations primarily are attributable to higher policyholder account balances as a result of sales and interest earned by the policyholders 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants relating to limitations on liens and sale or issuance of capital stock of the corporation 
in the event the corporation violates such covenants as defined in the indenture  we may be obligated to offer to repurchase the entire outstanding principal amount of such notes 
as of december   we believe that we are in compliance with all of the covenants 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed 
we believe that a portfolio composed principally of fixed rate investments that generate predictable rates of return should back our fixed rate liabilities 
we do not have a specific target rate of return 
instead  our rates of return vary over time depending on the current interest rate environment  the slope of the yield curve  the spread at which fixed rate investments are priced over the yield curve  and general economic conditions 
our portfolio strategy is designed to achieve adequate risk adjusted returns consistent with our investment objectives of effective asset liability matching  liquidity and safety 
in order to maintain consistency in our portfolio  our deferred annuity products incorporate surrender charges to discourage surrenders or withdrawals 
an annuitant may not terminate or withdraw funds from their annuity contracts for a significant initial period generally seven years without incurring substantial penalties in the form of surrender charges 
these surrender charges generally range from to of the investment 
approximately  and of the insurance company s deferred annuity contracts in force measured by reserves as of december    and are surrenderable without charge 
the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio changes as interest rates change 
in general  rate decreases cause asset prices to rise  while rate increases cause asset prices to fall 
based on market values and prevailing interest rates as of december   a hypothetical instantaneous increase in interest rates of basis points would produce a loss in fair value of our fixed maturity assets of approximately million 
asset liability management a persistent concern of the insurance company s management is maintaining the appropriate balance between the duration of its invested assets and the duration of its contractual liabilities to its annuity holders and credit suppliers 
over the past two years  the insurance company has permitted the duration gap between its assets and liabilities to rise during a period in which it expected relatively stable interest rates and  most importantly  in which its liabilities were largely protected by significant annuity surrender charges 
this strategy benefited the company by allowing it to realize enhanced yield from longer duration assets 
the insurance company has determined that the prospect of rising rates and declining surrender charges now necessitate a reduction in the duration mismatch  as well as increased management of extension risk in its investment portfolio 
the company has developed a two step duration reduction strategy  which involves the sale of certain longer duration assets that were purchased at prices below current market prices and reinvestment in shorter duration assets 
since december   the company has completed in excess of million of long duration sales and million of shorter duration reinvestments  as measured by proceeds 
the company estimates that it has now substantially completed its portfolio rebalancing target 
the company also anticipates that the lower level of income generated by its rebalanced portfolio will be more than offset by the gains on the sale of its longer term assets and by the income from the us treasury strips it is consolidating 
see item management discussion and analysis principal protected notes 
the insurance company conducts periodic cash flow tests assuming different interest rates scenarios in order to demonstrate the ability to meet any surrender demands without incurring substantial losses 
if a test reveals a potential deficiency in its cash flow  the insurance company may be required to increase its reserves against such liabilities to satisfy its statutory accounting requirements in  the insurance company increased its reserves on a statutory basis by million to address these contingencies 
as a further element of its asset liability management strategy  the company intends to hedge against the risks posed by a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates by entering into a form of derivative transaction known as payor swaptions 
swaptions are options to enter into an interest rate swap arrangement with a counter party at a specified future date 
at expiration  the counter party would be required to pay the insurance company the amount of the present value of the difference between the fixed rate of interest on the swap agreement and a specified strike rate in the agreement multiplied by the notional amount of the swap agreement 
the effect of these transactions would be to lessen the negative impact on the insurance company of a significant and prolonged increase in interest rates 
with the swaptions  the company should be able to maintain more competitive crediting rates to policyholders when interest rates rise 
the insurance company has submitted its derivate use plan concerning the payor swaptions to the nysid and is awaiting required approval before implementing the plan 
the insurance company has engaged the financial risk management group of milliman  inc  its actuarial consulting firm  to assist it in connection with its proposed use of these derivative investments 
line of credit the short term notes payable relates to a line of credit issued by the bank of new york in the amount of  the line of credit provides for interest on borrowings based on the  and day libor rate depending on the duration of the corporation s periodic renewals 
at december  the corporation had the full  outstanding 
the line of credit renews annually and is up for renewal on april  if the bank chooses not to renew the line of credit  the corporation would be forced to pay down the  in april or seek alternative financing options 
the corporation does not believe that there would be a material adverse impact on its liquidity or cash flow position if the line of credit were called in april off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and has made no financial commitments or guarantees with any unconsolidated subsidiary or special purpose entity 
all of the corporation s subsidiaries are wholly owned and their results are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contain information regarding payments required under existing long term borrowing arrangements 
the following presents a summary of the corporation s significant contractual obligations 
payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years after years total long term debt obligations policyholder account balance with contractual maturities these liabilities are reflected within policyholder liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet  and amount to million as of december  the difference between the recorded liability and the total payment amount is million and is comprised of i future interest to be credited and ii the effect of mortality discount for those payments that are life contingent 
most of the remaining policyholder liabilities  million involve deferred annuity contracts  which are contractually surrenderable at any time 
approximately of these obligations have surrender penalties 
these surrender charges  along with those contracts that involve contractual maturities  help to mitigate the asset liability management process 
see discussion under liquidity and capital resources section 
long term debt obligations consist of million  senior notes due february  see note in notes to the consolidated financials statements for additional discussion concerning both long term and short term obligations 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes in a rising interest rate environment  the insurance company s average cost of funds would be expected to increase over time  as it prices its new and renewing annuities to maintain a generally competitive market rate 
in addition  the market value of the insurance company s fixed maturity portfolio decreases resulting in a decline in shareholders equity 
concurrently  the insurance company would attempt to place new funds in investments that were matched in duration to  and higher yielding than  the liabilities associated with such annuities 
moreover  surrenders of its outstanding annuities would likely accelerate 
management believes that liquidity necessary in such an interest rate environment to fund withdrawals  including surrenders  would be available through income  cash flow  the insurance company s cash reserves and  if necessary  proceeds from the sale of short term and long term investments 
in a declining interest rate environment  the insurance company s cost of funds would be expected to decrease over time  reflecting lower interest crediting rates on its fixed annuities 
should increased liquidity be required for withdrawals in such an interest rate environment  management believes that the portion of the insurance company s investments that are designated as available for sale in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet could be sold without materially adverse consequences in light of the general strengthening in market prices that would be expected in the fixed maturity security market 
interest rate changes also may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of our annuity products 
for example  if interest rates rise  competing investments such as annuity or life insurance products offered by the insurance company s competitors  certificates of deposit  mutual funds and similar instruments may become more attractive to potential purchasers of the insurance company s products until the insurance company increases the rates credited to holders of its annuity products 
in contrast  as interest rates fall  we would attempt to lower our credited rates to compensate for the corresponding decline in net investment income 
as a result  changes in interest rates could materially adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the insurance company depending on the attractiveness of alternative investments available to the insurance company s customers 
in that regard  in the current interest rate environment  the insurance company has attempted to maintain its credited rates at competitive levels designed to discourage surrenders and also to be considered attractive to purchasers of new annuity products

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies  estimates and related judgments underlying the corporation s consolidated financial statements are summarized below 
in applying these accounting policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the insurance company s business operations 
investments the insurance company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of other than temporary impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
recognition of income ceases when a bond goes into default and management evaluates whether temporary or other than temporary impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause and decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the other than temporary impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  ii whether the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii financial difficulties being experienced by an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv economically depressed geographic locations  v situations where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi in situations where it is determined that an impairment is attributable to changes in market interest rates  the corporation s ability and intent to hold impaired securities until recovery of fair value at or above cost  and vii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on valuation methodologies  securities the company deems to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect of the estimated fair value amounts 
deferred policy acquisition costs the insurance company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new business 
these costs  which vary with and are primarily related to the production of newbusiness  are deferred 
the recovery of such costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related product  which in turn is dependent mainly on investment returns in excess of interest credited  as well as  persistency and expenses 
these factors enter into management s estimate of future gross profits  which generally are used to amortize such costs 
changes in these estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the deferred acquisition cost asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross profits are less than amounts deferred 
future policy benefits the insurance company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under life and health insurance policies and annuity contracts 
generally  these amounts are payable over a long period of time and the profitability of the products is dependent on the pricing 
principal assumptions used in pricing policies and in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are investment returns  mortality  expenses and persistency 
the reserves reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements included herein are calculated based on gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states in which the insurance company does business and those reflected in the insurance company s statutory financial statements 
these differences arise from the use of different mortality and morbidity tables and interest rate assumptions  the introduction of lapse assumptions into the reserve calculation and the use of the net level premium reserve method on all insurance business 
see notes g  h and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the reserves reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements are based upon the corporation s best estimates of mortality  persistency  expenses and investment income  with appropriate provisions for adverse statistical deviation and the use of the net level premium method for all non interest sensitive products 
for all interest sensitive products  the policy account value is equal to the accumulation of gross premiums plus interest credited less mortality and expense charges and withdrawals 
in determining reserves for its insurance and annuity products  the insurance company performs periodic studies to compare current experience for mortality  interest and lapse rates with expected experience in the reserve assumptions 
differences are reflected currently in earnings for each period 
the insurance company historically has not experienced significant adverse deviations from its assumptions
