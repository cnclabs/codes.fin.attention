headquartered in las vegas  we have gaming operations in nevada  illinois  louisiana  mississippi  indiana and new jersey 
our main business emphasis is on slot revenues  which are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties 
gross revenues are one of the main performance indicators of our properties 
most of our revenue is cash based  and our properties generate significant operating cash flow 
our industry is capital intensive  and we rely heavily on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing  fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development and the payment of dividends 
results of operations we have aggregated certain of our wholly owned properties in order to present five reportable segments boulder strip  coast casinos  stardust  downtown properties and central region

adjusted ebitda is presented before preopening and merger  acquisition and transition related expenses as it represents a measure of performance of our existing operational activities 
we use property level adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda before corporate expense as the primary measure of operating performance of each of our properties 
adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income  as an indicator of our operating performance  or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities  as a measure of liquidity  or as any other measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we have significant uses of cash flows  including capital expenditures  interest payments  taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda

management overview over the past few years  we have been working to strategically position our company for greater success by strengthening our operating foundation and effecting strategic growth in order to attempt to increase shareholder value 
in  we added five casino hotel properties through the july merger with coast casinos and the may acquisition of the shreveport property 
coast casinos four hotel casino properties in las vegas cater mainly to las vegas local residents providing us with a greater presence in the historically profitable and growing las vegas market 
we are currently focused on expansion projects at several of our properties and the development of a new property in the las vegas locals market  the south coast 
these projects are described in more detail at projects 
in addition  we recently have begun the process of assembling a team of professionals to evaluate the stardust and barbary coast sites and the las vegas market to assist in the creation of master plans for these properties 
as we are in the very early planning process  we currently do not have any significant details surrounding this potential future development 
in addition to our expansion projects mentioned above  we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets and through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated gross revenues consolidated gross revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in consolidated gross revenues was the addition of coast casinos and sam s town shreveport 
excluding the results of the recently acquired coast casinos and sam s town shreveport  gross revenues increased for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the increase is due mainly to increased slot and table game wagering at stardust and at the boulder strip properties  where gross revenue increased by and  respectively 

table of contents part ii continued construction disruption at delta downs related to its casino remodeling and reconfiguration was the primary cause of a decline in the property s gross revenues during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the delta downs project was completed in march and is further described at projects delta downs 
total adjusted ebitda total adjusted ebitda increased million  or  for as compared to the primary reason for the increase in total adjusted ebitda is the addition of coast casinos and sam s town shreveport as well as a million increase in operating income from borgata  before preopening expenses and our amortization expenses  which operated for only six months during the year ended december  prior to borgata s july opening  our share of its results was characterized as preopening expenses  which is excluded from our adjusted ebitda presentation 
consolidated operating income for the year ended december   consolidated operating income nearly doubled to million from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in consolidated operating income is the increase in total adjusted ebitda discussed above 
additionally  we recorded our share of preopening expenses from borgata of million during  thereby reducing our operating income during the prior year 
included in operating income for the year ended december  are million of merger  acquisition and transition related expenses that relate to the merger with coast casinos and the shreveport acquisition 
operating income for the year ended december  was also impacted by a million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses due mainly to the coast casinos and shreveport acquisitions 
a consulting agreement signed in connection with blue chip s purchase agreement provided for a million contingent payment if certain tribal gaming facilities had not commenced gaming operations near our blue chip casino by a specified date 
as tribal gaming facilities had not commenced by the specified date  we expensed and paid the million fee during the quarter ended december  sam s town tunica reported an operating loss of million for the year ended december  due to a history of operating losses at sam s town tunica  we tested the assets of sam s town tunica for recoverability pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the asset recoverability test requires estimating sam s town tunica s undiscounted future cash flows and comparing that aggregate total to the property s carrying value 
as the property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value  we do not believe sam s town tunica s assets to be impaired at this time 
however  we are continuing to monitor the performance of sam s town tunica and will  if necessary  continue to update our asset recoverability test under sfas no 
if future asset recoverability tests indicate that the assets of sam s town tunica are impaired  we will be subject to a non cash write down of its assets which would likely have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
due to a recently issued accounting standard  beginning july   we will be required to expense the cost of share based compensation awards 
we expect the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations but have not yet completed our analysis to quantify this impact 
in addition  in  we will adopt the guidance of the emerging issues task force regarding the methodology used to perform our impairment tests on our indefinite lived intangible assets 
this change in methodology could result in a non cash impairment charge which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements and would be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we are currently in the process of performing the impairment tests  but have not yet concluded on the results of the tests 
for more information  refer to new accounting policies 
other non operating costs and expenses other non operating costs and expenses are primarily comprised of interest expense 
for the year ended december  and  interest expense  net of interest income and capitalized interest  was million and million  respectively 
capitalized interest for and was million and million  respectively 
as a result of the fair value hedge accounting for our interest rate swaps outstanding during the periods  our interest expense during the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively  less than the contractual rate of the hedged debt 
the primary reasons for the increase in interest expense during the year ended december  were higher outstanding debt during the current period due to the acquisitions of coast casinos and sam s town shreveport and higher interest rates on our variable rate debt 
other non operating costs and expenses for the year ended december  include a million non cash loss on early retirement of debt related to the write off of unamortized debt fees associated with our old bank credit facility that was refinanced on july  in connection with the merger with coast casinos 
during  we sold certain parcels of undeveloped land and recorded an aggregate gain on the sales of million 
there were no such transactions during in addition  other non operating costs and expenses include our share of borgata s non operating expenses that are comprised primarily of interest expense that was partially offset by a benefit from state income taxes that is discussed below 
for the years ended december  and  our share of these expenses was million and million  respectively 
in addition  borgata s other non operating expense for the year ended december  was partially offset by a state tax benefit that is related to the recognition of operating loss carryforwards accumulated during borgata s development period 
based on new jersey state income tax rules  borgata is eligible for a refundable state tax credit under the new jersey new jobs investment tax credit because borgata made a qualified investment in a new business facility that created new jobs 
the total estimated available tax credit is approximately million over a five year period  subject to annual conditions 
borgata has filed a request for a net refund of approximately million related to the year ended december  and expects to file requests for refunds for each of the four years ending december  through december  
table of contents  ranging from approximately million to million per year 
due to various uncertainties  borgata had placed a valuation reserve on the entire amount of these state tax credits earned through september  in february  borgata received a refund notice from the new jersey division of taxation that caused it to reassess the valuation reserve and realize the benefit of all state tax credits earned through december  as such  borgata recorded million of net tax benefits including a valuation reversal benefit of million related to the new jersey new jobs investment tax credit in the year ended december  borgata may be entitled to incremental new jersey new jobs investment tax credits as a result of the borgata expansion as discussed in projects 
borgata is also entitled to a credit against its new jersey adjusted net profits tax if they make qualifying capital expenditures  as defined by statute 
in  borgata placed a valuation reserve of approximately million on the credit because it had not made any qualifying capital expenditures nor did it have any definitive expansion plans 
in december  borgata commenced an expansion project and submitted the appropriate applications for reimbursement of this tax 
as such  borgata released the valuation allowance on the credit and realized an additional credit of million  representing of the new jersey adjusted net profits tax paid in this million aggregate state tax benefit is included in borgata s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for the year december  was as compared to for included in the provision for the year ended december  was a million charge  net of federal benefit  related to an adverse tax ruling in indiana 
in  we received a proposed assessment from the indiana department of revenue based upon its position that our indiana gaming revenue tax is not deductible for indiana state income tax purposes 
an unrelated third party had been litigating the issue in the indiana tax court for several years under a similar fact pattern 
due to the uncertainty of the outcome of the tax court litigation  we had been accruing a portion of the proposed assessment and our estimate of potential future assessments based on our estimate of the probability of loss 
on april   the indiana tax court ruled against the third party 
on september   the indiana supreme court denied the third party s petition for review  affirming the tax court s earlier decision 
after the april ruling  we determined that it was probable that we had incurred a liability for the entire assessment and estimated future assessments and have recorded the related remaining amounts 
as such  we recorded a million charge  net of federal income tax benefit  to our income tax provision during the three months ended march  as of december   we have settled all outstanding assessments related to this issue 
we intend to compute our future indiana state tax expense consistent with the indiana tax court ruling 
net income as a result of these factors  we reported net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated gross revenues consolidated gross revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in gross revenues was the commencement of slot operations at delta downs and dockside operations at blue chip 
delta downs racetrack and casino commenced slot operations in february and its gross revenues increased million for the year ended december  as compared to a portion of this increase was due to increased slot wagering for the period of time the property was open in both and as the property refined its marketing programs during those periods 
in august  blue chip commenced dockside operations which resulted in a increase in gross revenues for as compared to also contributing to the increase in gross revenues for the year ended december  was increased slot wagering at sam s town las vegas due to more effective marketing strategies 
as a result of these main factors  gross revenues at sam s town las vegas increased for as compared to partially offsetting the increases in gross revenue was a decline in gross revenue at par a dice 
the property has experienced declines in slot wagering during due primarily to the effects of competition  mainly from neighboring states that have a more favorable gaming tax structure than illinois 
total adjusted ebitda total adjusted ebitda decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the primary reasons for the declines in total adjusted ebitda are declines in adjusted ebitda at the central region and downtown properties as well as the stardust of  and respectively 
adjusted ebitda at the central region properties declined during due mainly to the increase in gaming taxes experienced at both par a dice and blue chip 
for the year ended december   based on s gaming revenue and admissions  par a dice s gaming tax expense increased million as compared to blue chip s gaming tax increased million for as compared to based on s gaming revenue and admissions 
in addition  blue chip recorded a million one time retroactive gaming tax charge reflecting taxes imposed by the state of indiana during the year ended the decline in the downtown properties adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  as compared to was due mainly to higher charter costs  including fuel costs experienced at vacations hawaii  our hawaiian travel agency 
heavier marketing and promotional spending at the stardust due to the competition on the las vegas strip was the primary factor that caused a decline in the property s adjusted ebitda 
consolidated operating income consolidated operating income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decline in consolidated operating income is the decline in total 
table of contents part ii continued adjusted ebitda discussed above 
partially offsetting the decline in consolidated operating income was a decrease in operating loss from borgata 
the operations from borgata  which commenced on july   nearly offset their preopening expenses for our share of operating loss from borgata for only includes our share of borgata s preopening expenses 
consolidated operating income during the year includes million of preopening expenses that related mainly to delta downs  as well as our unsuccessful efforts related to a potential rhode island casino 
in addition  during  we recorded a million loss on assets held for sale as we reduced the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
other non operating costs and expenses other non operating costs and expenses are primarily comprised of interest expense 
for the years ended december  and  interest expense  net of interest income and capitalized interest  was million and million  respectively 
these amounts are net of capitalized interest of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and interest expense was higher during due mainly to a decline in capitalized interest during also impacting interest expense during were lower average outstanding debt balances  declines in interest rates due to our fixed rate debt refinancings that occurred during and declines in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
in addition  as a result of the fair value hedge accounting for our interest rate swaps outstanding during the periods  our interest expense during and was million and million  respectively  less than the contractual rate of the hedged debt 
in addition  other non operating costs and expenses include our share of borgata s non operating expenses of million

during the year ended december   we recorded a million loss on the early retirement of debt related to the purchase and cancellation of approximately million original principal amount of our senior notes due and the tender and call for redemption of our senior subordinated notes due  partially offset by the adjusted basis of certain hedged debt as a result of fair value hedge terminations 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the quarter ended march   in connection with the initial application of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  we reported an million charge as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to write down the remaining goodwill balance related to the acquisition of the stardust 
the fair value of stardust s goodwill was determined by management through the use of available and forecasted operating information as well as the use of an independent appraisal 
net income as a result of the factors discussed above  we reported net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operating activities and working capital for the year ended december   we generated operating cash flow of million compared to million for the primary reason for the increase in operating cash flow is the addition of the earnings from coast casinos and sam s town shreveport  which we acquired in july and may  respectively 
as of december  and  we had balances of cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively  and working capital deficits of million and million  respectively 
historically  we have operated with minimal or negative levels of working capital in order to minimize borrowings and related interest costs under our bank credit facility 
the revolver portion of our bank credit facility generally provides any necessary funds for our day to day operations  interest and tax payments as well as capital expenditures 
on a daily basis  we evaluate our cash position and adjust our revolver balance as necessary by either paying it down with the excess cash or borrowing under the revolver 
we also plan the timing and the amounts of our capital expenditures 
we believe that our bank credit facility and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and maintenance capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the costs associated with the expansions at delta downs and blue chip and the development of south coast 
cash flows from investing activities we are committed to continually maintaining and enhancing our facilities  most notably by upgrading and remodeling our casinos  hotel rooms  restaurants  and other public spaces and by providing the latest slot machines for our customers

depending upon market conditions  shares may be repurchased from time to time at prevailing market prices through open market or negotiated transactions 
no date was established for the completion of the share repurchase program and we are not obligated to purchase any shares 
subject to applicable securities laws  repurchases may be made at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate 
purchases under the program can be discontinued at any time management feels additional purchases are not warranted 
we will finance any purchases with funds from our operations 
we did not repurchase any stock during the year ended december  however  during  we repurchased an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock at a total cost of million

the following table sets forth the cash dividends declared and paid payment date record date dividend per share amount september  august  million december  november  million march  february  million june  may  million september  august  million december  november  million march  february  million projects delta downs 
in july  we announced development plans for our delta downs property and subsequently began an expansion project at delta downs that is expected to cost approximately million 
the first two phases  which were completed in  involved expanding the size of the casino building to provide customers with a more open and comfortable environment  including wider aisles on the slot floor 
the final phase of the project included the development of a room hotel at the property  the addition of food and beverage amenities and an events center 
construction of the final phase began in early and was completed in march as of december   we have paid approximately million related to this project since its inception in we intend to position ourselves better in the market by improving delta downs casino environment and offering our customers more amenities 
in addition  the expansion is intended to help us compete with the casino that pinnacle entertainment is expected to open in spring in lake charles  louisiana 
blue chip 
construction is underway for significant redevelopment at our blue chip hotel and casino 
we are building a new boat  which will allow for more gaming positions and for the casino to be located on one floor instead of on the three story boat now in operation 
we are also constructing a new parking structure and reconfiguring and refurbishing the existing pavilion 
with this project  we intend to position ourselves better in the current market environment with an improved facility and to be prepared to compete more effectively if a land based casino operation is developed in our area in the future 
the project is expected to cost approximately million and be completed near the end of as of december   we have paid approximately million related to this project since its inception in we intend to utilize the existing three story boat in our operations after the completion of the expansion of the gaming operations onto the new boat 
we are currently contemplating operational uses for the old boat including utilizing its space for conventions and meetings  offices and or warehouse storage 
should we decide to sell the old boat  abandon it  or cease to use it in our operations  we would become subject to either an impairment analysis or accelerated depreciation expense  depending upon our intentions  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
all of the necessary permits are in place for the construction of the blue chip project 
however  three of our permits have been challenged by third parties 
these challenges may cause a delay in the expansion project  which may cause a significant increase in project costs or the expansion may not be completed  all of which would have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these are described in more detail at item legal proceedings 
the pokagon band of potawatomi indians  a federally recognized native american tribe  announced  in  its intentions to construct a land based gaming operation in or near the city of new buffalo  michigan  which is located less than fifteen miles from blue chip 
in august  the pokagons received a favorable ruling from the michigan supreme court regarding the validity of their compact with the state of michigan  however  the pokagons have other remaining legal and regulatory issues that must be resolved prior to construction of the proposed gaming facility 
if their facility is constructed and begins operations  it could have a material adverse impact on the operations of blue chip 
south coast 
in april  coast casinos broke ground for a new hotel casino named south coast that is located on approximately acres of land on las vegas boulevard south  adjacent to interstate and approximately five miles south of mandalay bay resort and casino 
south coast is expected to include rooms and suites  approximately  slot machines  table games  seven restaurants  movie theaters  race and sports books  bingo  bowling  an equestrian events center and  square feet of convention  exhibit and banquet space 
based upon the current construction plans  we expect to spend approximately million  from the date of the merger  to complete the project that is expected to open in early from july  through december   we have paid approximately million related to this project 
the source of funds for the delta downs  blue chip and south coast projects is expected to come from cash flows from operations and availability  after we meet our working capital needs  under our bank credit facility 
we could also fund these projects with incremental bank financing  additional debt or equity offerings 
additional financing may not be available to us  or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
borgata 
in july  we announced that borgata has commenced planning and design work for substantial additions of both gaming and non gaming amenities  including additional slot machines  table games  poker tables  restaurants and nightclubs 
construction has begun on the public space expansion project and completion is expected to occur in the second quarter of the total estimated cost of the public space expansion is approximately million 
in october  we announced that borgata is in the planning phases for a further expansion that involves a new hotel tower  a new spa and additional meeting room space 
as the hotel expansion is currently in the planning process and subject to various approvals  we have not yet determined the cost of the project 
construction for the rooms expansion is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of with completion scheduled for the fourth quarter of borgata expects to finance the expansions from borgata s cash flow from operations and from borgata s recently 
table of contents modified bank credit facility  which is capable of being expanded 
we do not expect to make further capital contributions to borgata for these projects 
we can provide no assurances that our expansion and development projects will be completed within our current estimates  commence operations as expected  include all of the anticipated amenities  features or facilities or achieve market acceptance 
our expansion project at blue chip and the expansion of borgata are subject to the many risks inherent in expansion projects  including potential unanticipated design  construction  regulatory and environmental problems  increased project costs and timing delays 
in addition  the south coast development project is subject to all of the same risks discussed above  as well as those additional risks inherent in the development and operation of a new or expanded business enterprise  including potential unanticipated operating problems 
if any of our expansion or development projects do not become operational within the time frame and project costs currently contemplated or do not successfully compete in their markets  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
once our projects become operational  they will face many of the same risks that our current properties face including  but not limited to  increases in taxes due to changes in legislation 
in addition  the expansion projects relating to existing properties may not help us compete with new or increased competition 
other opportunities 
we regularly investigate and pursue additional expansion opportunities both in nevada and in other markets where casino gaming is currently permitted 
we also pursue expansion opportunities in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 
such expansions will be affected and determined by several key factors  including n outcome of license selection processes  n approval of gaming in jurisdictions where we have been active but where casino gaming is not currently permitted  n identification of additional suitable investment opportunities in current gaming jurisdictions  and n availability of acceptable financing 
additional projects may require us to make substantial investments or may cause us to incur substantial costs related to the investigation and pursuit of such opportunities  which investments and costs we may fund through cash flow from operations or availability under our bank credit facility 
to the extent such sources of funds are not sufficient  we may also seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
indebtedness bank credit facility 
on july  and concurrent with the consummation of the merger with coast casinos  inc  the billion bank credit facility the bank credit facility among boyd gaming  bank of america  n 
a and certain other financial institutions became effective 
the bank credit facility replaced our old bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility consists of a billion revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the revolving credit facility matures in june and the term loan matures in june the term loan is required to be repaid in increments of million per quarter that began on september  and will continue through march  amounts repaid under the term loan may not be reborrowed 
the interest rate on the term loan is based upon either the agent bank s quoted base rate or the eurodollar rate  plus a fixed margin 
the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is based upon either the agent bank s quoted base rate or the eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin that is determined by the level of a predefined financial leverage ratio 
in addition  we incur commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility that ranges from to per annum 
the bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of boyd gaming s real and personal property other than stock and other equity interests  including each of its wholly owned casino properties 
the blended interest rates for outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility at december  and were and  respectively 
at december   approximately million was outstanding under the term loan  million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and million was allocated to support various letters of credit  leaving availability under the bank credit facility of approximately million 
the bank credit facility contains certain financial and other covenants  including  without limitation  various covenants i requiring the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio  ii establishing a maximum permitted total leverage ratio and senior leverage ratio  iii imposing limitations on the incurrence of additional secured indebtedness  iv imposing limitations on the maximum permitted expansion capital expenditures during the term of the bank credit facility  v imposing restrictions on investments  dividends and certain other payments  and vi requiring that we maintain a minimum amount of senior unsecured public and or subordinated indebtedness outstanding 
we believe we are in compliance with the bank credit facility covenants as of december  senior subordinated notes due april in april  we issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due april the notes require semi annual interest payments on april th and october th of each year that began in october and will continue through april  at which time the entire principal balance becomes due and payable

we believe we are in compliance with the covenants related to these notes as of december  the million principal amount of our senior notes due august are guaranteed by a majority of our significant subsidiaries  however  the acquisitions of coast casinos and sam s town shreveport created significant subsidiaries that do not guarantee these notes 
the guarantees are full  unconditional and joint and several 
other debt 
in november  in connection with the acquisition of certain real estate  we assumed a mortgage with a balance of million that is secured by the real property 
the mortgage bears interest at the rate of per annum 
the mortgage is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest through may   when the remaining balance becomes due and payable

the note bears interest at the rate of per annum 
the note is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest until march  when the remaining balance becomes due and payable 
the note is secured by the airplane 
our ability to service our debt will be dependent on future performance  which will be affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control 
it is unlikely that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our indebtedness as it matures and to fund our other liquidity needs 
we believe that we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at maturity 
however  we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we could have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners 
these financing strategies may not be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  certain states laws contain restrictions on the ability of companies engaged in the gaming business to undertake certain financing transactions 
some restrictions may prevent us from obtaining necessary capital 
contractual obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations interest obligations on fixed rate debt purchase obligations entertainment contracts expansion projects other other long term obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents includes interest rate obligations on our fixed rate debt that comprises billion of our total december  debt balance of billion 
our variable rate debt at december  consists of billion in outstanding balances on our bank credit facility 
interest payments for future periods related to the variable rate debt are dependent upon certain items including future eurodollar rates and the outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility  that fluctuate from period to period and have not been presented in this table 
at december   the blended interest rate for outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility was 
entertainment contracts outstanding at december  relate primarily to stardust contracts with various performers 
other consists of various contracts for good and services  including our contract for hawaiian air charter operations 
other long term obligations relate primarily to deferred compensation balances and swap liabilities at december  in addition  we have outstanding commitments at december  at december   we were in the process of a million project at delta downs  a million project at blue chip and a million project at south coast 
open purchase orders related to these projects are included in the table above 
we are required to pay  to the city of kenner  louisiana  a boarding fee of for each passenger boarding our treasure chest riverboat casino during the year 
the future minimum payment due in to the city of kenner  based upon a portion of actual passenger counts from the prior year  is approximately million 
our ability to service our contractual obligations and commitments will be dependent on our future performance  which will be affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control 
off balance sheet arrangements 
our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which mainly consist of our investment in borgata 
we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities  nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than straightforward interest rate swaps  and through borgata  interest rate caps and collars 
our joint venture investment allows us to realize the benefits of owning a full scale resort in a manner that lessens our initial investment 
we do not guarantee financing obtained by borgata  nor are there any other provisions of the venture agreement which are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort 
we have entered into certain agreements that contain indemnification provisions such as indemnification agreements with our executive officers and directors and provide indemnity insurance pursuant to which directors and officers are indemnified or insured against liability or loss under certain circumstances which may include liability or related loss under the securities act and the exchange act 
in addition  our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that provide for indemnification of our directors  officers  employees and other agents to the maximum extent permitted by law 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million which primarily relate to an insurance carrier 
new accounting policies in september  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued eitf d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  which requires the application of the direct value method for intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed after september  in addition  eitf d requires companies that have applied the residual method to the valuation of intangible assets acquired prior to such date for purposes of impairment testing to perform an impairment test using the direct value method beginning with their fiscal year beginning after december  impairments of intangible assets recognized upon application of a direct value method should be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we have utilized a residual cash flow methodology in performing our annual impairment tests for all of our indefinite lived intangible assets acquired prior to for the transition testing in as well as annually thereafter  we intend to utilize the direct value method to perform our impairment tests on such indefinite lived intangible assets 
this change in method during could result in a non cash impairment charge for some or all of our indefinite lived intangible assets acquired prior to such a charge could materially affect our consolidated financial statements and would be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on our consolidated statement of operations 
we are currently in the process of performing the impairment tests  but have not yet concluded these tests 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
this statement amends certain accounting literature to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we currently do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
also in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and superseded accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
this cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
this statement also addresses the accounting for the tax effects of share based compensation awards 
this statement is effective for us on july  we currently expect to adopt this standard on that date using the modified prospective application 
under the modified prospective application  we expect to expense the cost of share based compensation awards issued after july  additionally  we expect to recognize compensation cost for the portion of awards outstanding on july  for which the requisite service has not been rendered as the requisite service is rendered on or after july  we currently expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations but have not yet completed our analysis to quantify this impact 

table of contents part ii continued critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies may require a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we evaluate our goodwill  intangible other long lived assets in accordance with the applications of sfas no 
related to goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
related to impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for goodwill and intangible assets  we review the carrying values on an annual basis 
for assets to be disposed of  we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal  as estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers  or a discounted cash flow model 
for assets to be held and used  we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
inherent in the reviews of the carrying amounts of the above assets are various estimates 
first  management must determine the usage of the asset 
to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold  it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized 
assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
this means that some assets must be grouped  and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets 
future cash flow estimates are  by their nature  subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods 
our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory  social and economic climates  recent operating information and budgets of the various properties where we conduct operations 
these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal  state or local regulations  economic downturns  or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have tested the assets of sam s town tunica for recoverability during as the property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value  we do not believe sam s town tunica s assets to be impaired at this time 
however  we will continue to monitor the performance of sam s town tunica as well as continue to update our asset recoverability test under sfas no 
if future asset recoverability tests indicate that the assets of sam s town tunica are impaired  we will be subject to a non cash write down of its assets which would likely have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditure and depreciation 
we must also make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense is highly dependent upon the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
derivative instruments 
we utilize an investment policy for managing risks associated with our current and anticipated future borrowings  such as interest rate risk and its potential impact on our fixed and variable rate debt 
under this policy  we may utilize derivative contracts that effectively convert our borrowings from either floating rate to fixed or fixed rate to floating 
the policy does not allow for the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to the extent we employ such financial instruments pursuant to this policy  and the instruments qualify for hedge accounting  we designate and account for them as hedged instruments 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the underlying hedged item must expose us to risks associated with market fluctuations and the financial instrument used must be designated as a hedge and must reduce our exposure to market fluctuations throughout the hedged period 
if these criteria are not met  a change in the market value of the financial instrument is recognized as a gain or loss in the period of change 
otherwise  gains and losses are not recognized except to the extent that the hedged debt is disposed of prior to maturity or to the extent that acceptable ranges of ineffectiveness exist in the hedge 
net interest paid or received pursuant to the financial instrument is included in interest expense in the period 
at december  and  we had five swaps outstanding with a total notional amount of million 
these swaps meet the criteria for fair value hedge accounting established by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 as well as the criteria for the shortcut method  which allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness 
as such  there was no net impact on our consolidated statement of operations from changes in values of the hedging instruments 
instead  the fair values of the instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets with offsetting adjustments to the carrying values of the related debt 
as such  at december   we recorded a long term asset of million and a long term liability of million on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  representing the fair market value of the swaps at that date 
at december   we recorded a net long term liability of million on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  representing the fair market value of the swaps at that date 
the corresponding net adjustments decreased the carrying values of the long term debt items hedged  as the interest rate swaps are considered highly effective under the criteria established by gaap 
in addition  borgata  our joint venture project  has entered into derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges to either fix or maintain  within a certain range  interest rates on its floating rate debt 
these derivative financial instruments have notional amounts some of which decline over time which totaled million at december  and expire in december the following table reports our share of the effects of borgata s derivative instruments for the periods indicated 
our share of the increase or decrease in fair value of certain financial instruments related to hedges deemed to be ineffective is reported on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
our share of the increase or decrease in fair value of certain financial instruments related to hedges deemed to be effective is reported in other comprehensive income on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and several states in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based upon the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcome of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
to determine necessary reserves  we must make assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  partially based on past experiences 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes relating to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates or when potential actions are settled differently than we expected  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the current period 
for example  in  we received a proposed assessment from the indiana department of revenue based upon its position that our indiana gaming revenue tax is not deductible for indiana state income tax purposes 
an unrelated third party had been litigating the issue in the indiana tax court for several years under a similar fact pattern 
due to the uncertainty of the outcome of the tax court litigation  we had been accruing a portion of the proposed assessment and our estimate of potential future assessments based on our estimate of the probability of loss 
on april   the indiana tax court ruled against the third party 
on september   the indiana supreme court denied the third party s petition for review  affirming the tax court s earlier decision 
we determined that it was probable that we had incurred a liability for the entire assessment and estimated future assessments and recorded the related remaining amounts 
as such  we recorded a million charge  net of federal income tax benefit  to our income tax provision during the three months ended march   resulting in an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  self insurance reserves 
we are self insured up to certain stop loss amounts for employee heath coverage  workers compensation and general liability costs 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported 
in estimating these accruals  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claims 
we believe our estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon our methodology  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
litigation  claims and assessments 
we also utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments related to our business and tax matters 
these estimates are based upon our knowledge and experience about past and current events and also upon reasonable assumptions about future events 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  specifically long term us treasury rates and the applicable spreads in the high yield investment market and short term and long term eurodollar rates  and its potential impact on our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under our bank credit facility 
borrowings under our bank credit facility are based upon either the agent bank s quoted base rate or the eurodollar rate  plus applicable margins 
however  the amount of outstanding borrowings is expected to fluctuate from time to time 
we also attempt to manage the impact of interest rate risk on our long term debt by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
for more information  see note  derivative instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we utilized interest rate swap agreements 
interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are matched to specific fixed rate debt obligations 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreement outstanding at december  however  we believe that this risk is minimized because the counterparties to the swaps are existing lenders under our bank credit facility 
if we had terminated our swaps as of december   we would have been required to pay a total of million and would have been entitled to receive a total of million based on quoted market values from the financial institutions holding the swaps 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments both debt obligations and interest rate swaps that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates for our outstanding debt at december  and related weighted average interest rates as of december  for our interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amounts by the contractual maturity dates and variable rates 
the notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts 
the variable rates are based upon prevailing interest rates
