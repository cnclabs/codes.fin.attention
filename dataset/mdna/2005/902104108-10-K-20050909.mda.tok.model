item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are also identified by words such as expects  anticipates  believes  intends  plans  projects  or similar expressions 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including risk factors described in the risk factors set forth in this item introduction the company generates revenues  earnings and cash flows from developing  manufacturing and marketing high technology materials and derivative products for precision use in industrial  medical  military  security and aerospace applications 
we also generate revenue  earnings and cash flows from external customer and government funded research and development contracts relating to the development and manufacture of new technologies  materials and products 
our customer base includes original equipment manufacturers oem  laser end users  system integrators of high power lasers  manufacturers of equipment and devices for industrial  security and monitoring  x ray imaging  us government prime contractors  various us government agencies and thermoelectric solutions 
approximately of our revenues during the fiscal year ended june  were from product sales to customers outside the united states 
the following discussion and analysis includes the seven months financial results for the year ended june  of the company s recently acquired marlow industries  inc subsidiary included in the compound semiconductor group since the date of acquisition 
all per share data for this year and former periods cited in this discussion and analysis have been adjusted to reflect the two for one split of the company s common shares paid as a stock dividend to shareholders of record on march  and distributed on march  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations requires the company s management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty reserves  inventory valuation  valuation of long lived assets including acquired intangibles and goodwill  accrual of bonus and profit sharing estimates  accrual of income tax liability estimates  accounting for stock based compensation and self insurance for workers compensation 
management believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is established or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue for all business segments  other than for contract research and development  is recognized from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
the company performs research and development under contract agreements with customers based on cost plus fixed fee  cost reimbursable or fixed fee terms 
these contracts generally require the company to produce and provide developmental materials and or products to those customers 
revenues from cost plus fixed fee and cost reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
the company follows the guidelines of statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts for our fixed fee contracts 
revenue and profits on each fixed fee contract are accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting  whereby revenue and profits are recognized throughout the performance period of the contract 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
the estimated total cost for each contract is periodically reevaluated and revised  when necessary  throughout the life of the contract 
losses on contracts are recorded in full when identified 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts and a warranty reserve based on historical experience and believes the collection of revenues  net of these reserves  is reasonably assured 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate for potential non collection of accounts receivable based on historical experience 
the company has not experienced a non collection of accounts receivable materially affecting its financial position or results of operations as of and for the fiscal years ended june   and if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate causing an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for bad debts may be required in future periods 
the company records a warranty reserve as a charge against earnings based on a percentage of revenues utilizing actual returns over the last twelve months 
if actual returns in the future are not consistent with the historical data used to calculate these estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required 
the company records a slow moving inventory reserve as a charge against earnings for all products on hand more than twelve months to eighteen months depending on the products that have not been sold to customers or cannot be further manufactured for sale to alternative customers 
an additional reserve is recorded for product on hand that is in excess of product sold to customers over the same periods noted above 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than projected  additional inventory reserves may be required 
the company tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on at least an annual basis for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the determination of related estimated useful lives of other intangible assets and whether goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles are impaired involves judgments based upon long term projections of future performance 
a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the fair value of the reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment 
based on the results of the most recently completed analysis  the company s goodwill was not impaired as of june  no event has occurred as of or for the period ended june  that would give management an indication that an impairment charge was necessary that would adversely affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company records bonus and profit sharing estimates as a charge against earnings based on a formula percentage of the company s operating income 
these estimates are adjusted to actual based on final results of operations achieved during the fiscal year 
partial bonus amounts are paid quarterly based on interim company performance  and the remainder is paid after fiscal year end and final determination of the applicable percentage 
other discretionary bonuses are paid annually 
the company records an estimated income tax liability to recognize the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or income tax returns 
judgment is required in estimating the future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or the income tax returns 
the company uses the intrinsic value approach specified in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  for stock options granted to officers and key employees  and therefore does not record compensation costs based upon the fair value of options at the date of grant 
see notes a and l to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which amends sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value  and will be effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after june  the company will adopt this accounting change effective july  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the company is self insured for certain losses related to workers compensation 
additionally  third party insurance is obtained to limit our exposure to these claims in excess of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate per policy year 
when estimating the self insurance liability  the company considers a number of factors  including historical claims experience  demographic and severity factors and valuations provided by independent third party consultants 
periodically  management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party consultants to determine the adequacy of the self insurance liability 
from time to time  estimated accruals are recorded as a charge against earnings based on known circumstances where it is probable that a liability has been incurred or is expected to be incurred and the amount can reasonably be estimated 
fiscal compared to fiscal overview millions except per share data results of operations year ended june  increase bookings revenues net earnings diluted earnings per share net earnings net earnings increased in fiscal to million per share diluted from million per share diluted in fiscal net earnings increase was primarily attributed to revenue growth in all the company s operating segments 
in particular the infrared optics and near infrared optics segments achieved increases in revenues of and respectively from the prior year 
in addition to the above  the company s newly acquired subsidiary  marlow contributed to the net earnings growth 
earnings increases also resulted from operating improvements from the prior year due to production efficiencies and cost savings realized through increased manufacturing performed at the company s singapore and china facilities and the lowering of the effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal bookings bookings increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal order backlog increased to million at june  included in the fiscal bookings and order backlog are million of bookings and million of backlog at june  from marlow 
the company s infrared optics and near infrared optics bookings increased and  respectively  over the prior year 
growth in the united states co laser market fueled the increase in the infrared optics segment 
laser system builders continue to develop higher power cutting systems  the combination of the increasing powers and the growing installed laser base should increase optics consumptions at a solid pace for fiscal year the near infrared optics segment increase was driven by the company s ramp up of their uv filter product line for which bookings of million were recorded during fiscal the company s military optics segment bookings decreased due to delays in the defense procurement cycle and increased competition in the military optics market 
the company s compound semiconductor group  exclusive of marlow  experienced a decrease in bookings of approximately 
the majority of this decrease was due to the company s ev products division receipt of approximately million in order cancellations from two oem customers 
revenues revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal included in the fiscal year revenues were million of revenue contributions from marlow 
excluding marlow  leading this growth was the company s near infrared optics segment which recorded an increase in revenues of 
the majority of this increase was attributable to the segment s uv filter product line which recorded revenues of million during fiscal the company s infrared optics and military optics segments increased revenues of and  respectively 
the revenue growth in the infrared optics segment is due to the strong demand of our optics particularly in the aftermarket as more laser systems are being deployed 
the increase in revenues in the military optics segment was driven by strong demand for the company s core military and sapphire products due to the need to repair and replace hardware expended or damaged in the war against terror 
outlook the company anticipates continued strengthening of its addressable markets in fiscal  and is currently projecting for fiscal revenues to range from million to million and diluted earnings per share to range from to 
earnings per share outlook for the fiscal year ending june  reflects implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no

fas r requires expensing the calculated fair value of our incentive stock options 
this non cash stock option charge currently is expected to reduce earnings per share by approximately to in the fiscal year ending june  bookings  revenues and segment earnings loss for the company s reportable segments are discussed below 
segment earnings is a non gaap financial measure and differs from income from operations in that segment earnings excludes certain operational expenses included in other expense net as reported 
management believes segment earnings to be a useful measure as it reflects the results of segment performance over which management has direct control and is used by management in its evaluation of segment performance

near infrared optics millions year ended june  increase decrease bookings revenues segment earnings bookings for fiscal for near infrared optics increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in bookings was primarily driven by an increase in demand for the company s uv filter product line which recorded million more bookings in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
in addition  yag and other crystal product bookings increased approximately from the prior year 
revenues for fiscal for near infrared optics increased to million compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to increased shipments of the company s uv filter product line which ramped up production during fiscal the company recorded million of uv filter revenue compared to million in fiscal in addition to the increased uv filter revenue  the company recorded approximately more optic shipments during fiscal segment earnings for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease in segment earnings reflects higher operating costs driven by a higher proportion of lower margin shipments during the current fiscal year and the ramp up of costs associated with the uv filter product line 
military infrared optics millions year ended june  increase decrease bookings revenues segment earnings bookings for fiscal for military infrared optics decreased to million from million in fiscal the reduction in bookings was primarily driven by delays in the defense procurement cycle and increased competition in the military optics market 
revenues for fiscal for military infrared optics increased to million compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was due primarily from strong demand for core military products due to the need to repair and replace hardware expended or damaged in the war against terror 
in addition  the company s sapphire product line revenues increased approximately million from the prior year as the company continues to develop this part of its business 
segment earnings for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in segment earnings was due to overall increase in revenues and favorable product mix with higher revenues from core military products with higher gross margins 
compound semiconductor group millions year ended june  increase decrease bookings revenues segment loss the company s compound semiconductor group includes the combined operations of marlow for the seven months in fiscal year since the date of acquisition  the company s ev products division  the company s wbg group  and the company s advanced materials development center amdc 
combined bookings for fiscal from these operations increased to million as compared to million in fiscal included in the current fiscal year bookings were million from marlow 
excluding the bookings from marlow for the current year  bookings for the compound semiconductor group decreased million or 
the decrease in bookings primarily resulted from the company s ev products division receiving order cancellations of approximately million from two oem customers 
revenues for fiscal from these operations increased to million compared to million in included in the current fiscal year revenues were million from marlow 
excluding revenues from marlow for the current year end  revenues for the compound semiconductor group were consistent with the prior fiscal year 
the segment loss for fiscal of million decreased from the segment loss of million in fiscal the improvement in the segment loss was attributed to the inclusion of marlow s operations during the current year which offset slightly higher segment losses at ev products and wbg 
costs and expenses manufacturing gross margin  which is defined as net sales less cost of goods sold  for fiscal was million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues in fiscal the increased gross margin in relative dollars was due to higher sales levels than the prior year while the decrease in the gross margin as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the addition of marlow which historically has a lower gross margin than the core ii vi operating segments 
other factors impacting the gross margin of specific business segments were noted in the previous discussion of segment results 
contract research and development gross margin  which is calculated as contract research and development revenues less expenses  for fiscal was million of research and development revenues  compared to a gross margin of million of research and development revenues  for fiscal the contract research and development revenues and costs are a result of development efforts in the near infrared optics and the military infrared optics segments as well as activities in marlow  the ev products division and the wbg group for fiscal the improvement in the contract research and development gross margin was due to increased contract activity in the current year 
in addition  our military optics segment recognized approximately million of gross margin during the current fiscal year related to its large optics coating contract 
contract research and development gross margin is a result of a blend of cost plus fixed fee  cost reimbursement and fixed fee contract activities 
company funded internal research and development expenses for fiscal were million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues  for fiscal the higher dollar amount is primarily the result of the addition of internal research and development at our marlow subsidiary combined with more corporate research and development activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues for fiscal the dollar increase reflects the addition of marlow during the year and higher salary expense for the company s worldwide profit driven bonus program 
in addition  outside professional services  including services relating to section of sarbanes oxley  contributed to the increase from the prior year 
from a percentage of revenue standpoint  the addition of marlow and this business s selling  general and administration cost structure has lowered this metric for the company 
interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the increase in interest expense reflects an increase in the company s debt levels from the prior year due to the financing of the acquisition of marlow 
as of june   the company s had outstanding debt of million compared to million outstanding at june  during fiscal the company capitalized approximately million of interest associated with its coating and administrative office expansion in saxonburg  pennsylvania 
the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was and was lower than the income tax rate for fiscal of 
the company s effective income tax rate reflects the company s continued benefit from lower tax rates on its singapore and china operations and a favorable mix of us and foreign income 
the company entered into a development and expansion initiative with the singapore government whereby ii vi singapore lowered its effective tax rate to approximately 
it is expected that this favorable tax structure will exist for another two to three years 
the american jobs creation act of  signed into law in october  provides for a variety of changes in the tax law including incentives to repatriate undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  phased elimination of the extraterritorial income benefit and a domestic manufacturing benefit 
management currently estimates that the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion will result in an increase in income tax expense but expects a portion of this increase to be offset by the deduction on manufacturing income 
the company is evaluating the implications of the new law on repatriation of foreign earnings including assessing the details of the act  analyzing the funds available for repatriation and the economic cost of doing so  assessing the qualified uses of repatriated funds and assessing the domestic manufacturing benefit 
however  given the stage of our evaluation  at this time it is not possible to determine what impact this legislation may have on our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ending june  fiscal compared to fiscal overview millions except per share data results of operations year ended june  increase bookings revenues net earnings diluted earnings per share net earnings net earnings increased in fiscal to million per share diluted from million per share diluted in fiscal net earnings increase was primarily attributed to the overall strong demand for all of the company s products as evidenced by an increase in revenues from the prior year 
earnings increases also resulted from operating improvements in all segments from the prior year due to production efficiencies  yield improvements and cost control programs 
approximately one half of the earnings improvement was attributable to stronger revenues and gross margins from the infrared optics segment and approximately one third of the earnings improvement was attributable to operational performance improvements of our ev products division 
bookings bookings increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal order backlog increased to million at june  from million at june  as a result of bookings outpacing shipments in fiscal manufacturing orders comprised approximately of the backlog at june  manufacturing bookings increased by approximately million while contract research and development bookings increased by approximately million

during fiscal  the company received a stop work order relating to this contract as the entire comanche helicopter defense initiatives was cancelled by the us government 
the decrease in contract revenues is primarily due to lower contract activity in the near infrared optics segment and the wbg group during fiscal contract research and development gross margin is a result of a blend of cost plus fixed fee  cost reimbursement and fixed fee contract activities 
company funded internal research and development expenses for fiscal were million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues  for fiscal the higher expense is a direct result of less external contract support of the company s wbg group s efforts in sic crystal growth technology and processing development 
company funded internal research and development expenses also include corporate research and development activities in addition to the research and development activities of the ev products division 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues for fiscal the dollar and percentage increases reflect higher salary expenses for the company s worldwide profit driven bonus program 
the increase in selling  general and administration expense from fiscal was also attributed to costs associated with the acquisition of a majority interest in ii vi lot suisse sarl during the second quarter of fiscal year while this acquisition increased the company s direct selling expense by approximately of sales as compared to the prior year  this expense increase has been offset by the additional gross margin on sales to end customers in switzerland 
interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense reflects lower libor based interest rates  as well as a reduction in debt levels throughout fiscal at june   total debt was lower as compared to june  other expense for fiscal almost completely offset our other income items 
other expense in was primarily due to the minority interest in ii vi lot gmbh and ii vi lot suisse sarl  foreign currency losses as a result of the us dollar s performance relative to other currencies and losses recognized on disposal property  plant and equipment offset by interest and other income 
other expense in fiscal was primarily due to the minority interest in ii vi lo

the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to an effective income tax rate of for fiscal the company s effective income tax rate reflects the company s continued benefit from lower tax rates on its singapore and china operations and a favorable mix of us and foreign income 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary source of cash has been provided through operations and long term borrowings 
other sources of cash include proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and long term borrowings 
our historical uses of cash have been for capital expenditures  purchases of businesses and payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations

the increase in cash was driven by the company s net earnings of million along with depreciation and amortization expense of million 
the increase in cash was offset by working capital requirements of million 
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year of million was primarily for the company s acquisition of marlow of million  property plant and equipment expenditures of million and note purchase agreement and an additional investment in unconsolidated business of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year of million included short term and long term borrowings totaling million  payments made on borrowings of million and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
on december   the company replaced its million secured credit facility with a million secured credit agreement in connection with the company s acquisition of marlow 
this facility has a five year term and contains a term loan in the original amount of million and a million line of credit 
the facility is collateralized by a pledge of of the stock of certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
additionally  the facility is subject to certain restrictive covenants  including those relating to minimum net worth  leverage and consolidated debt service coverage 
the facility has an interest rate range of libor plus to libor plus 
principal payments of million under the term loan are payable quarterly beginning january  the weighted average interest rate of borrowings under the credit agreements was for the fiscal year ended june  the company had available million under its line of credit as of june  on may   the board of directors authorized the company to purchase up to  shares of its common stock 
the repurchase program calls for shares to be purchased in the open market or in private transactions from time to time

we are a leading producer of znse for our internal use and for external sale 
the production of znse is a complex process requiring production in a highly controlled environment 
a number of factors  including defective or contaminated materials  could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality znse 
znse is available from only one outside source where quantity and qualities may be limited 
the unavailability of necessary amounts of high quality znse would have a material adverse effect upon us 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we produce hydrogen selenide gas which is used in our production of znse 
there are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material 
our inability to effectively handle hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of hydrogen selenide 
hydrogen selenide is available from only one outside source where quantities and qualities may be limited 
the cost of purchasing such material is greater than the cost of internal production 
as a result  purchasing a substantial portion of such material from the outside source would increase our production costs of znse 
therefore  our inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
during fiscal  our infrared optics segment has experienced higher raw material costs  specifically for selenium which is used in our growth process for znse 
we have experienced an increase in selenium prices from approximately per pound two to three years ago to around per pound currently 
in addition  we produce and utilize other high purity  relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products 
failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
international sales account for a significant portion of our revenues sales to customers in countries other than the united states accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the years ended june   and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we manufacture products in singapore  china and vietnam and maintain direct sales offices in germany  japan  switzerland  the uk and belgium 
sales and operations outside of the united states are subject to certain inherent risks  including fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  tariffs  quotas  taxes and other market barriers  political and economic instability  restrictions on the export or import of technology  potentially limited intellectual property protection  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in particular  currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business in the local currency could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition by rendering us less price competitive than foreign manufacturers 
our sales in japan are denominated in yen and  accordingly  are affected by fluctuations in the dollar yen currency exchange rates 
we generally reduce our exposure to such fluctuations of the yen through forward exchange agreements which target to hedge approximately of our sales in japan 
we do not engage in the speculative trading of financial derivatives 
there can be no assurance  however  that our practices will reduce or eliminate the risk of fluctuation of the yen in the us dollar japanese yen currency exchange rate 
we may encounter substantial competition we may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market  including established companies with significant resources 
some of our competitors may have financial  technical  marketing or other capabilities more extensive than ours and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors  and competition may adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there are limitations on the protection of our intellectual property we rely on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyright and trademark laws combined with employee non competition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology
