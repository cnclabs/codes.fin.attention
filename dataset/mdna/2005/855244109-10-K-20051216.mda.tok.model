the fiscal year ended october   included weeks  with the rd week falling in the fiscal fourth quarter 
management overview during the fiscal year ended october   all areas of starbucks business  from us and international company operated retail operations to the company s specialty businesses  delivered strong financial performance 
starbucks believes the company s ability to achieve the balance between growing its core business and building the foundation for future growth is the key to increasing long term shareholder value 
starbucks fiscal performance reflects the company s continuing commitment to achieving this balance 
the primary driver of the company s revenue growth continues to be the opening of new retail stores  both company operated and licensed  in pursuit of the company s objective to establish starbucks as the most recognized and respected brand in the world 
starbucks opened  new stores in fiscal and plans to open approximately  in fiscal with a presence in countries  management continues to believe that the company s long term goal of  starbucks retail locations throughout the united states and at least  stores in international markets is achievable 
in addition to opening new retail stores  starbucks works to increase revenues generated at new and existing company operated stores by attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current 
table of contents customers 
the strategy is to increase comparable store sales by continuously improving the level of customer service  introducing innovative products and improving the speed of service through training  technology and process improvement 
global comparable store sales for company operated markets increased by  making fiscal the th consecutive year with comparable store sales growth of five percent or greater 
comparable store sales for fiscal are expected to be in the range of three to seven percent 
in licensed retail operations  starbucks leverages the expertise of local partners and shares its operating and store development experience to help licensees improve the profitability of existing stores and build new stores 
internationally  the company s strategy is to selectively increase its equity stake in licensed international operations as these markets develop 
the combination of more retail stores  higher revenues from existing stores and growth in other business channels in both the united states and international operating segments resulted in a increase in total net revenues for the weeks of fiscal  compared to the weeks of fiscal excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal  total net revenues increased 
both of these revenue growth measures were at or above the company s three to five year target of approximately 
the company s international operations delivered improved operating results  primarily due to leverage gained on most operating expenses distributed over an expanded revenue base 
in recent fiscal years  the company made substantial infrastructure investments in corporate and regional support facilities and personnel  as well as established more efficient distribution networks 
such investments have been and will continue to be necessary to support the company s planned international expansion  which is now realizing substantial benefit from this foundation 
since both additional international and us retail stores can leverage existing support organizations and facilities  the company s infrastructure can be expanded more slowly than the rate of revenue growth and generate margin improvement 
in fiscal  operating income as a percentage of total net revenues increased to from in fiscal  and net earnings increased by  compared to fiscal these results demonstrated the company s ability to improve operating margin while at the same time making strategic investments in the core retail business and in emerging specialty channels 
acquisitions during fiscal  starbucks increased its equity ownership in its licensed operations in germany  southern china and chile  to  and  respectively  for a combined purchase price of million 
previously  the company owned less than in each of these operations  which were accounted for under the cost method 
these increases in equity ownership resulted in a change of accounting method  from the cost method to the consolidation method  on the respective dates of acquisition 
this accounting change also included adjusting previously reported information for the company s proportionate share of net losses in germany  southern china and chile 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change for previously reported information resulted in a reduction of net earnings of million for the weeks ended july   and a reduction of retained earnings of million prior to fiscal in april  starbucks acquired substantially all of the assets of ethos brands  llc  ethos  a privately held bottled water company based in santa monica  california  for million

table of contents commodity prices  availability and general risk conditions the company manages its exposure to various risks within the consolidated financial statements according to an umbrella risk management policy  which was approved in may by the company s board of directors 
under this policy  market based risks  including commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates  are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies  such as entering into hedging transactions 
additionally  this policy restricts  among other things  the amount of market based risk the company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and does not allow for speculative trading activity 
the company purchases significant amounts of coffee and dairy products to support the needs of its company operated retail stores 
the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the company s results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations

financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates  equity security prices and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities is transacted in us dollars 
however  because a portion of the company s operations consists of activities outside of the united states  the company has transactions in other currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  british pound sterling  euro and japanese yen 
under the company s umbrella risk management policy  the company frequently evaluates its foreign currency exchange risk by monitoring market data and external factors that may influence exchange rate fluctuations 
as a result  starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments  with maturities generally not exceeding five years  to hedge assets  liabilities  revenues and purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
as of october   the company had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  to hedge a portion of anticipated international revenue and product purchases 
in addition  starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as a hedge of its net investment in starbucks japan 
these contracts expire within months 
based on the foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of october   a devaluation of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract as of october   would result in a reduced fair value of these derivative financial instruments of approximately million  of which million may reduce the company s future earnings 
conversely  a appreciation of the us dollar would result in an increase in the fair value of these instruments of approximately million  of which million may increase the company s future earnings 
consistent with the nature of the economic hedges provided by these foreign exchange contracts  increases or decreases in their fair value would be mostly offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the dollar value of the company s foreign investment  future foreign currency royalty fee payments and product purchases that would occur within the hedging period

these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in interest and other income  net in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
interest rate risk the company s available for sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments 
the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity 
available for sale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its available for sale securities 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying interest rate of its interest bearing financial instruments  including its short term borrowings and long term debt  as of the end of fiscal  and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  significant portions of the company s net revenues and profits were  and may continue to be realized during the first quarter of the company s fiscal year  which includes the december holiday season 
in addition  quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores  and the company s rapid growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences 
because of the seasonality of the company s business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
starbucks considers its policies on impairment of long lived assets and accounting for self insurance reserves to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows  in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses 
for goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the company s trademarks 
upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be 
table of contents recoverable  the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations 
property  plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment 
cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets  these factors could cause the company to realize material impairment charges 
self insurance reserves the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool  to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation  healthcare benefits  general liability  property insurance  director and officers liability insurance and vehicle liability 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities  portions of which are calculated by third party actuarial firms  could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends
