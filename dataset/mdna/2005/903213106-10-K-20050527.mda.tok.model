item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act 
these statements appear in a number of places in this report and include statements regarding our plans  beliefs or current expectations  including those plans  beliefs and expectations of our officers and directors with respect to  among other things the development of markets for our products  the adequacy of our cash balances and liquidity to meet future operating needs  and our ability to issue equity or debt securities  and the effect of legal actions and claims that we are involved in 
important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward looking statements are listed below in part ii  item other information 
introduction we generate revenue from two principal activities research  development and application engineering services that are paid for by our customers  and the sale of motors  generators and electronic controls 
the sources of engineering revenue typically vary from year to year and individual projects may vary substantially in their periods of performance and aggregate dollar value 
our product sales consist of both prototype low volume sales  which are generally sold to a broad range of customers  and annually recurring higher volume production for three principal customers during the fiscal year ended march  invacare corporation  ballard power systems  inc and keith products  inc 
for the previous two fiscal years  revenue derived from funded engineering activities was and million  respectively 
in the fall of we completed a follow on offering of our common stock which generated net proceeds of million raising our available cash balances on hand upon completion of the offering to million 
we expect to use the proceeds to fund a modification in our business strategy that allows us to invest in selective customer projects that we believe will result in volume production and to expand our production engineering and business development groups in anticipation of the continued emergence of the market for hybrid electric vehicles 
hybrid electric vehicles require electric motors and generators of the type we design and manufacture  and we intend to aggressively pursue both this emerging market as well as conventional markets where electric motors and generators are currently in use 
as a result of the reallocation of engineering resources to these activities  our revenue from funded research and development declined by approximately percent to million 
similarly  expenditures on production engineering activities for the fiscal year rose to million versus zero in each of the preceding two fiscal years 
product sales revenue for the fiscal year rose modestly to million versus million last fiscal year driven by an increase in low volume product sales  which rose to million from million 
volume product sales remained flat at million this fiscal year versus last fiscal year due to a stabilization in wheelchair motor sales after a steep decline in production of these units two years ago 
however we continue to expect that sales of new production wheelchair motors will phase out by the end of the third quarter of our next fiscal year  although sales of field service units are expected to continue indefinitely 
loss from continuing operations for the current fiscal year rose to million  or per common share  versus million  or per common share  for our last fiscal year and million  or per common share  for the preceding fiscal year 
the expansion in losses from two fiscal years ago to the current fiscal year is generally attributable to declining total revenue  lower gross profit margins on contract services  higher research and development expenditures in fiscal and higher expenditures for the launch of our production engineering group in fiscal in may  we divested a contract electronics manufacturing business that was not a core business activity 
operating losses from this business for all periods presented have been reclassified to discontinued operations and contributed million  or nil per common share  million  or per common share  and million  or per common share  to our consolidated loss for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we believe our existing cash and short term investments  which amounted to approximately million at fiscal year end  will be adequate to fund the modification in our business strategy described above  as well as  the the launch of new production products over the next several years 
financial condition cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at march  were  and working capital the excess of current assets over current liabilities was  compared with  and  respectively  at march  the increase in cash and short term investments and working capital is primarily attributable to proceeds from a follow on offering completed in november  which resulted in cash proceeds  net of offering costs  of  accounts receivable increased  to  at march  from  at march  the increase is primarily attributable to higher product sales revenue levels for wheelchair motors and slower collections during the fourth quarter of fiscal of the resulting accounts receivable 
historically  we have had nominal bad debt expense arising from uncollectible accounts receivable due to the high credit quality of our customers 
accordingly  no allowance for bad debts has been recorded at march  or  respectively 
costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts increased  to  at march  versus  at march  the increase is due to less favorable billing terms on contracts in process at march  versus march  estimated earnings on contracts in process declined to  or percent of contracts in process of  at march  compared to estimated earnings on contracts in process of  or percent of contracts in process of  at march  the decrease in estimated margins on contracts in process is attributable to anticipated cost overruns on certain engineering projects 
inventories increased  to  principally due to higher levels of raw material  work in process and finished goods inventories which increased   and  respectively 
the increases in raw materials and work in process inventories are attributable to higher production levels of wheelchair propulsion motors 
the increase in finished goods inventories is attributable to higher production levels of low volume motors and controllers that will be shipped in future periods 
prepaid expenses increased to  at march  from  at march  primarily due to higher levels of prepaid software and patent maintenance costs at the end of the current fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year end 
assets of discontinued operations was nil at march  compared to  at march  due to the completion of the divestiture of the equipment and inventory of our electronics products segment and the subsequent cessation of operations during the first quarter of fiscal year see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
we invested  for the acquisition of property and equipment during the fiscal year compared to  last fiscal year 
the increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to an investment in quality control equipment in our power products segment 
accounts payable increased  to  at march  from  at march   primarily due to increased purchases of raw material 
other current liabilities increased  to  at march  from  at march  the increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of accrued payroll and employee benefits  customer deposits  unearned revenue and accrued royalties 
liabilities and commitments of discontinued operation were  at march  compared to  at march  the decrease was due to the completion of the divestiture of the equipment and inventory of our electronic products segment and subsequent cessation of operations during the first quarter of fiscal year the remaining march  balance represents legal fees associated with the hussmann litigation see also note to the consolidated financial statements and the current portion of the accrued lease obligations reflecting the estimated obligation for future lease payments on subleased facilities of our discontinued electronic products segment for which we are the primary obligor 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased  to  at march  from  at march  reflecting reduced levels of billings on engineering contracts during the fiscal year ended march  versus the prior fiscal year 
long term debt  less current portion decreased  to  at march  from  at march  reflecting principal repayments on the mortgage debt for our frederick  colorado facility 
long term accrued lease obligation was  at march  compared to  at march  reflecting the estimated obligation for future lease payments on subleased facilities of our discontinued electronic products segment for which we are the primary obligor 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements below 
common stock and additional paid in capital increased to  and  respectively  at march  compared to  and  at march  the increases were primarily attributable to completion of a follow on offering of  shares of common stock to investors in north america and europe 
net cash proceeds to the company from the offering were  results of continuing operations continuing operations for the fiscal year ended march   resulted in a loss of  or per common share  compared to a loss from continuing operations of  or per common share  and  or per common share  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in the current year loss from continuing operations is attributable to declining total revenue  lower gross profit margins on contract services  higher expenditures for the launch of our production engineering group  and the inclusion in the prior two fiscal years of gain on sale of taiwan joint venture of  or nil per common share  and gain on sale of real estate of  or per common share  in fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from contract services declined  or percent  to  at march  compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower staff utilization on revenue generating programs due to cost overruns on certain engineering projects and the application of certain engineering personnel that would typically be billed to customers to our internally funded production engineering activities 
revenue from contract services decreased  or percent  for the year ended march  compared to revenue for the year ended march  reflecting the application of engineering resources to internally funded research and development programs 
product sales this fiscal year increased percent to  compared to  for the year ended march  product sales revenue for the fiscal year ended march  declined percent from  for the year ended march  to  power products segment revenue for the year ended march  decreased  or percent  to  compared to  for fiscal year ended march  due to decreased shipments of wheelchair propulsion motors 
we expect that sales of new production wheelchair propulsion motors will phase out by the end of the third quarter of our next fiscal year  although sales of field service units are expected to continue indefinitely 
power products segment revenue for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to  or percent  compared to  for fiscal year ended march  due to decreased shipments of wheelchair propulsion motors 
technology segment product revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased  or percent  to  compared to  for fiscal year ended march  due to increased shipments of propulsion systems for hybrid electric bus programs and the hybrid electric unmanned ground vehicle program 
technology segment product revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased  or percent  versus revenue for the fiscal year ended march  reflecting increased shipments of fuel cell air compressor drive motors and propulsion systems 
gross profit margins for the fiscal year decreased to percent compared to and percent for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  primarily due to a decrease in gross profit margins on contract services 
gross profit on contract services was a negative percent this fiscal year compared to and percent for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in contract services margins for the current fiscal year versus the fiscal year ended march  is attributable to decreased overhead absorption and cost overruns on certain engineering contracts this year versus the prior fiscal year period 
the increase in contract services margins for the fiscal year ended march  versus the fiscal year ended march  is attributable to increased overhead absorption and lower levels of cost overruns on certain engineering contracts 
gross profit margin on product sales this fiscal year was percent compared to percent and percent in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in margins on product sales for this fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year is attributable to a more favorable product mix 
the decrease in margins on product sales for the fiscal years ended march  versus the fiscal year ended march  resulted from decreased overhead absorption associated with lower revenue levels in our power products segment 
research and development expenditures for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to  compared to  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to the completion of an internally funded development of a new microprocessor platform for our power electronics controls mid fiscal year that was started in fiscal the increase in research and development expenditures for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily due to an internally funded effort to develop a new micro processor platform for our power electronic controls and an increase in cost share type contracts 
production engineering costs were  for the fiscal year ended march  versus zero for the prior two fiscal years 
the increase is attributable to our strategy to increase our manufacturing capability and infrastructure  and consists primarily of salary and overhead costs for newly hired manufacturing management and staff personnel 
general and administrative expense this fiscal year was  compared to  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease for this fiscal year versus last fiscal year is primarily attributable to lower insurance premium costs 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  versus the fiscal year ended march  is primarily attributable to cost reduction activities at all business units throughout the year 
impairment of long lived assets for the fiscal years ended march  and march  were  and  respectively  and are attributable to the write down of costs associated with abandoned patent applications 
the impairment of long lived assets for the fiscal year ended march  of  is primarily attributable to the impairment and disposal of obsolete equipment and abandoned patent applications 
interest income rose to  for the current fiscal year compared to  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase is attributable to higher levels of invested cash and higher yields on invested balances during the fiscal year versus the two prior fiscal years 
interest expense decreased to  for the year ended march  compared to  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease is due to lower average mortgage borrowings outstanding throughout the fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase for fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to higher average mortgage borrowings throughout the fiscal year 
gain on sale of real estate in the fiscal year ended march  of  is attributable to the recognition of gain from the sale of our previous corporate facility 
results of discontinued operations in january  we committed to a plan to exit our contract electronics manufacturing business whose results were reported as the electronic products segment 
in may  we completed the divestiture of equipment and inventory of this business for which million in cash and a percent ownership interest in the purchaser 
we did not record any value for the common stock of the purchaser received in this transaction due to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize economic value on the resale of our ownership interest 
in addition  the purchaser executed a sublease on our st 
charles  missouri manufacturing facility for the remaining term of our lease 
however  we are the primary obligor on the lease and due to substantial doubt regarding the sublessee s financial capability to meet its obligation under the sublease  we have recorded an estimate of the potential shortfall under our master lease should payments under the sublease obligation not be fully honored 
at march  liabilities and commitments of discontinued operations totaled  of which  was associated with the lease commitment and  was accounts payable and other current liabilities 
in october  we formalized a plan to close our contract gear manufacturing business  which was part of our mechanical products segment 
the operating results of these businesses for the years ended march   and have been reported separately as discontinued operations together with estimated losses on the disposal of division assets 
loss from discontinued operations includes interest expense on debt used to acquire manufacturing machinery and equipment but does not include allocations of general corporate overheads  which have been allocated to other business segments 
operating results of all prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the contract electronics manufacturing and contract gear manufacturing businesses as discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended march  was  or nil per common share  compared to a loss from discontinued operations of  or per common share  and  or per common share  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our cash balances and liquidity throughout the fiscal year ended march  were adequate to meet operating needs 
at march   we had working capital the excess of current assets over current liabilities of  compared to  at march  the increase of  in working capital is primarily attributable to cash proceeds  net of offering costs  of  received from a follow on offering of common stock completed in november  higher levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and a reduction in liabilities of discontinued operations  which were partially offset by higher levels of accounts payable 
for the year ended march  net cash used in operating activities of continuing operations was  compared to net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended march  and cash provided by operations of  for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in cash usage is primarily attributable to higher levels of operating losses  accounts receivables and inventories this fiscal year versus last fiscal year 
the increase in cash used in operating activities for the year ended march  versus cash provided by operating activities for year ended march  was primarily due to higher levels of operating losses and lower levels of cash provided from collections of accounts receivable and the reduction of inventories 
net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations for the fiscal year ended march  was  compared to cash provided by investing activities of  for the previous fiscal year 
the change this fiscal year versus last fiscal year was primarily due to cash used for the purchase of short term investment securities of  the increase in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended march  versus cash used in investing activities for year ended march  was due to the sale of our ownership interest in taiwan uqm which provided cash proceeds of  and lower levels of capital expenditures for property and equipment  facility expansion and patent and trademark costs 
net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was  for the fiscal year ended march  versus  for the preceding fiscal year 
the increase is attributable to larger cash proceeds from the sale of common stock this year versus last year partially offset by reduced proceeds from bank borrowings during the current fiscal year 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal declined to  versus the fiscal level of  due to reduced proceeds from the sale of common stock and reduced proceeds from bank borrowings 
our mortgage debt facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants in order for the mortgage to continue to be available on a long term basis 
at march   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
in the event our operating results are not sufficient to maintain compliance with these covenants  we could experience a material adverse change in liquidity 
we expect to manage our operations and working capital requirements to minimize the future level of operating losses and working capital usage consistent with execution of our business plan  however  we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in achieving these objectives 
we believe our available cash resources are sufficient to fund our expected level of operations for the next several years 
during fiscal  the emerging market for hybrid electric automobiles began to expand at an unexpected rate due to the market success of hybrid electric passenger cars introduced by various automakers 
as a result  several additional automakers have announced planned introductions of similar vehicles and others are expected to follow as the market acceptance of these vehicles continues to grow 
in addition  truck manufacturers  off road vehicle manufacturers and numerous other vehicle manufacturers are considering hybrid electric systems for use in the vehicles they manufacture and market 
as a result of this industry trend  we expect expanded demand for our proprietary propulsion systems  which are suited for a wide range of hybrid electric vehicle platforms 
in order to capitalize on this anticipated expansion in demand  we have begun  and expect to continue  to make substantial investments from the proceeds of our recently completed follow on offering of common stock in human resources  manufacturing facilities and equipment  production and application engineering  among other things 
we expect to fund our operations over at least the next several years from existing cash and short term investment balances and from available bank financing  if any 
we can  however  not provide any assurance that our existing financial resources will be sufficient to execute our business plan 
if our existing financial resources are not sufficient to execute our business plan  we may issue equity or debt securities in the future 
in the event financing or equity capital to fund future growth is not available on terms acceptable to us  we will modify our strategy to align our operation with then available financial resources 
contractual obligations the following table presents information about our contractual obligations and commitments as of march  tabular disclosure of contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations executive compensation under employment agreements total includes potential retirement obligations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that effect the dollar values reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts receivables  costs to complete contracts  recoverability of inventories  warranty costs and potential future lease obligations arising from discontinued operations 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable our trade accounts receivable are subject to credit risks associated with the financial condition of our customers and their liquidity 
we evaluate all customers periodically to assess their financial condition and liquidity and set appropriate credit limits based on this analysis 
as a result  the collectibility of accounts receivable may change due to changing general economic conditions and factors associated with each customer s particular business 
we have established no reserve for potentially uncollectible trade accounts receivable  which is our best estimate of the amount of trade accounts receivable that we believe are uncollectible due to the foregoing factors 
it is reasonably possible  that future events or changes in circumstances could cause the realizable value of our trade accounts receivable to decline materially  resulting in material losses 
asset recovery and realization discontinued operations on may   we completed the sale of the assets of our electronic products segment 
part of the consideration received from this divestiture was common stock of the purchasing entity  a privately held corporation 
in our judgment there is substantial doubt regarding our ability in the future to sell or otherwise liquidate the common stock of the purchasing entity  and accordingly  we recorded the stock at no value as a result of this uncertainty 
in the event we are able to realize value from the sale or liquidation of this asset at a future date  we would at that time record a gain equal to the amount of the value received 
in addition  the purchaser completed a sublease agreement with us whereby it effectively assumed the remaining lease obligation under our master lease 
similarly  in our judgment there is substantial doubt regarding the purchaser s financial capability to meet its obligations under the sublease agreement 
accordingly  we have recorded a liability in the amount of  which represents our best estimate of the present value of future cash out flows that may arise if the sublessee defaults on the sublease prior to the completion of its term 
our assessments of the timing of a potential default  if any  together with estimates of potential future sublease rental rates and our ability to sublease the facility at all  in the event of default  could change materially based on future developments and events 
any change in these estimates could result in a material adverse change in our financial conditions and results of operations  in an amount up to the remaining payments under the lease which are an additional  at march inventories we maintain raw material inventories of electronic components  motor parts and other materials to meet our expected manufacturing needs for proprietary products and for products manufactured to the design specifications of our customers 
some of these components may become obsolete or impaired due to bulk purchases in excess of customer requirements 
accordingly  we periodically assesses our raw material inventory for potential impairment of value based on then available information  expectations and estimates and establish impairment reserves for estimated declines in the realizable value of our inventories 
the actual realizable value of our inventories may differ materially from these estimates based on future occurrences and any resulting change in our estimates 
it is reasonably possible  that future events or changes in circumstances could cause the realizable value of our inventories to decline materially  resulting in additional material impairment losses 
percentage of completion revenue recognition on long term contracts costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts we recognize revenue on the development projects funded by our customers using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  contract services revenue is based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to management s best estimate of the total costs to be incurred to complete the project 
many of these contracts involve the application of our technology to customers products and other applications with demanding specifications 
management s best estimates have sometimes been adversely impacted by unexpected technical challenges requiring additional analysis and redesign  failure of electronic components to operate in accordance with manufacturers published performance specifications  unexpected prototype failures requiring the purchase of additional parts and a variety of other factors that may cause unforeseen delays and additional costs 
it is reasonably possible that total costs to be incurred on any of the projects in process at march  could be materially different from management s estimates  and any modification of management s estimate of total project costs to be incurred could result in material changes in the profitability of affected projects or result in material losses on any affected projects 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas  which is the result of its efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements when implemented 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions sfas  which replaces the exception permitting non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets from measurement based on the fair value of the assets exchanged with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas shall be effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements when implemented 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r addresses all forms of share based payment sbp awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas r will require us to expense sbp awards as compensation cost based on the fair value of the sbp on the date of issuance 
sfas r requires us to adopt the new accounting provisions beginning april  we are evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not use financial instruments to any degree to manage these risks and do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
all of our product sales  and related receivables are payable in us dollars 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt obligations 
one of our long term debt obligations has a variable rate of interest indexed to the prime rate 
the interest rate on these instruments approximates current market rates as of march  a one percent change in the prime interest rate would increase or decrease interest expense by  on an annual basis on outstanding borrowings at march  with adjustable interest rate provisions
