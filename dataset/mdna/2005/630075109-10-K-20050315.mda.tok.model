overview nanogen  inc is headquartered in san diego  california and was founded on the vision of providing higher quality of healthcare by introducing advanced diagnostic medical products that will improve the quality of information in a shorter period of time to our customers in the research  clinical laboratory or point of care markets 
we intend to turn this vision into reality by continuing to develop new diagnostic products or by acquiring other companies and complementary products that will expand and accelerate our entry into rapidly growing diagnostic markets 
we expanded both our product lines and addressable markets during the past year with the acquisition of synx pharma in april and the acquisition of epoch biosciences in december these combinations will accelerate our entry into the point of care market and deepen our penetration of the research and clinical laboratory markets  respectively 
the combination of internally developed products plus acquired products addressing large markets should provide the stimulus for significant revenue acceleration in and beyond 
we have historically generated revenues through contract research  grants and licenses and through commercializing molecular diagnostic research tools  such as the molecular biology workstation and related analyte specific reagents asrs for the genetic and clinical research market 
in november we introduced our second generation molecular diagnostic instrument  the nanochip this platform is expected to ship in and is designed to serve the clinical laboratory market by offering faster throughput and simpler operating procedures 
the new system offers a site cartridge utilizing nanogen s unique and patented micro array technology that will allow customers the flexibility to adjust panels from single to multiple arrays to fit their requirements 
since commencing operations in  we have applied substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs on the technology associated with our nanochip system 
with the acquisition of synx  in  we began investing in research and development related to future point of care products 
we have incurred losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have focused on the advanced diagnostics market by commercializing products that enhance  bring cost saving and value to our laboratory testing customers 
in  we generated million in revenues with a net loss of million 
of this revenue approximately million was associated with product sales that consist of the sale and rental of our nanochip systems and associated consumables to the worldwide molecular diagnostic research market 
we sell our products to our customers fob shipping  and in the case of the nanochip system we offer our products under various commercial arrangements  some of which transfer title of the instrument to the customer and some of which do not transfer title to the customer 
an additional  of product sale revenue was generated from our recent acquisitions  which resulted in sales of various molecular chemistries  reagent products and point of care diagnostic tests 
the remainder of our revenue was through 
table of contents various contractual research agreements such as license fees of our patented technologies  sponsored research through our hitachi development agreement terminated in and contracts and grants revenue with governmental or commercial organizations 
revenues for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in thousands year over year growth or decline year over year growth or decline as a product sales license fee and royalty income sponsored research contracts and grants total product sales developments we have focused on creating product sales revenue through internally developed products as well as through acquisitions 
we initially entered the molecular diagnostics market by selling our first generation nanochip system  the molecular biology workstation  into the research market with a goal of becoming the industry s preferred platform for molecular testing 
we recognized prior to launching our first generation nanochip system in  that sales to the research market alone would not produce sufficient revenue to support our goals 
as a result  we have been working to enhance the initial product to enter the clinical laboratory market  and ultimately expect to address the point of care market with a micro array product in the future 
during we launched seven asrs  that can be used by clinical laboratories to assist them in developing diagnostic tests that can be run on our system 
additionally  in we expect to launch a second generation system  the nanochip  that should help broaden our reach into the clinical market place 
this new system is smaller  is expected to be easier to operate by laboratory personnel and its level of automation does not required continuous monitoring by a technician during production testing 
we also plan to expand our asr products for the nanochip during through the acquisition of epoch  we also provide real time asr products to clincial laboratories for simpler  lower cost tests than those addressed by our nanochip system  thus expanding the product portfolio available to our customers 
we also believe that epoch will provide additional revenue through providing custom products and services to research customers 
finally  we have been working on products that will allow us to begin addressing point of care customer needs 
specifically  through the acquisition of synx  we obtained the nexus dx myocardial infarction heart failure product line and are preparing to launch our statusfirst product for congestive heart failure in we also believe that epoch will provide us additional revenue through the chemistry  design  and synthesis of dna probes and optimization of real time pcr assays for our molecular diagnostic customers 
in addition to the acquisitions we believe we will generate additional revenue when we launch our second generation of the nanochip system in mid that is targeted at both the research and diagnostic markets with such products as our infectious disease diagnostics systems 
license fee and royalty income developments while we currently own issued us patents we have strategically limited the licensing of much of this technology to protect our intellectual property position in all areas of our business including the nanochip system  real time products and point of care markers 
we are now evaluating our intellectual property position in light of our recent acquisitions 
we may choose to license our technology in the future  if we believe the terms and conditions are acceptable given our investment into the research and development and its 
table of contents relationship to our future product pipeline 
in addition  with our acquisition of epoch we obtained a royalty agreement with applied biosystems  inc with contractual minimum royalties through the third quarter of and thereafter we will receive royalty payments based on actual sales 
sponsored research developments in july we executed a ten year agreement with hitachi  ltd  nissei sangyo co 
ltd 
and hitachi instruments service co 
ltd 
of japan collectively  hitachi to develop  manufacture and distribute potential products based on the parties proprietary technologies 
the agreement provides that we work together to jointly determine which projects to prioritize over the term of the agreement 
both hitachi and we may contribute cash toward our research and development over a ten year period 
at a minimum  we were required to match the hitachi contribution to our research and development on an annual basis 
in addition  we are required to repay to hitachi of their contributions to research and development over an indefinite period of time 
the repayment amount is determined as a percentage of our gross nanochip cartridge sales until the liability is paid in full 
in august  we received written notice from hitachi to exercise its right to terminate the collaborative research agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
hitachi s exercise of its right to terminate this agreement did not accelerate the repayment due hitachi 
from inception of the collaboration agreement with hitachi through december   we have received a total of million in sponsored research funding 
half of this funding has been recorded as revenue or deferred revenue  and the remaining half has been recorded as a long term liability 
we recognized the last  in revenue from hitachi in and do not expect any revenue from this agreement in the future 
contracts and grants developments we fund some of our research and development efforts through contracts and grants awarded by various federal and state agencies 
revenue is recognized under these contracts and grants as expenses are incurred 
we do not believe these grants will be our primary source of on going revenue but provide us additional revenue while offsetting our research and development costs 
we will continue to seek new contracts and grants that are aligned with our internal research and development goals 
in  we entered into no new contract and grants  however  we continued to receive revenue from the following on going grants 
us army medical research acquisition activity in october  we entered into a cooperative agreement with the us army medical research acquisition activity usamraa in an amount totaling approximately million over a three year period 
the objective of the usamraa agreement is to develop an arrayable electronic system for the identification of biological warfare or infectious disease agents 
in october  we entered into an additional cooperative agreement with usamraa in the amount totaling million over a three year period 
the second cooperative agreement is to develop miniaturized electronic devices for isolation and detection of biological warfare and infectious disease agents 
in conjunction with the agreements  funding provided by the agency is matched dollar for dollar with our funds 
we recognized revenue under these agreements of   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these agreements were completed in this year and do not expect any additional funding 
the national institute of justice in april  we entered into an agreement with the national institute of justice  us department of justice  which provides funding for the development of a chip based genetic detector for rapid dna based identification of individuals in an amount totaling approximately million over a year period 
we recognized revenue under this agreement of   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents national institutes of health nih the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases for the national institutes of health nih  provides funding for several grants 
in july  we were awarded a grant which focused on the development of a compact centrifugal micro fluidics based biological warfare agent bwa analyzer 
in may and september of  we were awarded a second and third grant 
the second grant is for the development of a dieletrophorectic dep separator for cell pathogen separation 
the third grant is aimed at developing an on chip real time dna amplification for bwa detection 
the awards under these grants totaled approximately million over a year period 
we recognized revenue under these agreements of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
acquisitions developments we actively and selectively seek to acquire companies with complementary products and strong intellectual property positions to allow us to penetrate emerging markets 
we anticipate using our common stock as the primary currency to purchase future companies or product lines 
in  we acquired in all stock transactions  synx and epoch to obtain new product lines for the point of care and advanced diagnostic markets  respectively 
we believe that these acquisitions are important to our long term strategy and are an example of our ongoing efforts to build a stronger company with products to serve the advanced diagnostic marketplace 
acquisition of synx pharma inc on april   we acquired all the outstanding common stock of synx pharma inc synx in an all stock transaction by way of a court approved plan of arrangement 
based in toronto  canada  synx leverages proteomic and biomarker research to develop a line of point of care diagnostic tests 
as a result of this acquisition  we have entered the point of care diagnostic market 
we believe that the future markets for advanced diagnostics will include research and clinical reference labs as well as the point of care market 
acquisition of epoch biosciences  inc on december   we acquired all the outstanding common stock of epoch biosciences  inc epoch 
based in bothell  washington  epoch develops and sells proprietary products with commercial applications in the genomics and molecular diagnostics fields 
as a result of the acquisition  we expect to broaden our product offerings to research institutions and clinical reference labs and further leverage our existing sales  marketing infrastructure and expand our customer reach 
sale of common stock developments in march  we sold million shares of our common stock to institutional investors at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of approximately million 
in april  we sold an additional  shares to institutional investors at a price of per share for gross proceeds of approximately million 
after deducting fees and expenses  we received approximately million from the sales 
we believe that it is beneficial to maintain a significant amount of cash and short term investments on hand to ensure we have adequate resources to fund future research and development  to create and expand sales distribution channels  to support future acquisitions  to provide working capital and assuage legal risks and challenges to our business model 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and 
table of contents judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of inventory  intangible assets and investments  income taxes  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition we have historically derived revenue principally from sales agreements and reagent rental cost per test agreements of the nanochip molecular workstation and related consumables  chemical  reagent products  molecular diagnostic products  from royalties for our intellectual property  sponsored research  contract and grant agreements and from license fees for intellectual property 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
valuation of intangible assets and investments our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
as of december   our goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization was approximately million 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
inventory we estimate and evaluate obsolescence or non marketability of our inventory and reduce the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or market by considering future purchase commitments based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
in  we took accounting charges of million to reduce our inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
theses charges primarily related to our first generation micro array instrument  the molecular biology workstation 
as of december   the net carrying value of our first generation instrument was  which we expect to be realizable in if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  either generation of our micro array instrument  or any other component of our inventory  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents income taxes we regularly review our established valuation allowance against our potential tax assets that is based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
as of december   our valuation allowance was million 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues the following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended december   and year ended december  year ended december  difference difference in thousands in thousands product sales license fee and royalty income sponsored research contracts and grants total product sales with our acquisitions of synx and epoch we have expanded our sources of product sales revenue from the nanochip system and associated consumables to include real time reagent products and molecular diagnostic point of care products 
in  we had approximately million from the direct sale and reagent rental cost per cartridges of the nanochip system and  of revenue associated with chemical  regent products and molecular diagnostic point of care products 
the downward trend in product sales revenue relates to the decreased sales of our first generation nanochip system 
this is partially due to the limited size of the molecular research market 
in  we began to address the much larger clinical diagnostic lab market  however  as the first generation of our product was designed for research applications and not diagnostic use  the clinical diagnostic customer s acceptance of our initial product has been limited 
our revenue was negatively impacted when we announced in the fourth quarter of our second generation molecular diagnostic system  which was designed specifically to meet the needs of the clinical diagnostic user  would be available in we believe that potential future diagnostic customers may be waiting for the next generation of our nanochip system  the nanochip the future we expect to continue to generate revenue from the nanochip system and associated consumables in the research market and are expanding into the molecular diagnostic and point of care markets 
a core element of this expansion strategy included the mergers with the point of care and molecular diagnostic companies  synx and epoch  respectively  to provide us revenue growth in we believe synx will allow us to penetrate the point of care market and provide us with additional revenue in through a new product for the diagnosis of congestive heart failure which is scheduled to begin shipping in the synx congestive heart failure product is expected to provide a minute test result and it will be offered with a point of care quantitative reader 
we also believe that epoch will provide additional revenues through the sale of real time asrs to clinical laboratories and the sale of custom products and services to research customers 
in addition to revenue from acquisitions  we believe we will generate additional revenue when we release in the nanochip in the nanochip is targeted at both the research and clinical laboratory markets 
we also plan to offer asrs including those for use in detection of respiratory viruses or for detection in the cftr gene associated with cystic fibrosis 

table of contents license fees include nonrefundable fees generated from the licensing of our technology with third parties 
license fees increased in from primarily due to contractual minimum royalties from combimatrix 
in addition  in the million was a result of a litigation settlement with combimatrix see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amount recorded in was based on the fair value of the combimatrix shares received in the settlement 
the future we are now focusing on evaluating our intellectual property in light of our recent acquisitions and anticipate having additional licensing opportunities of our intellectual property 
through our acquisition of epoch we obtained a royalty bearing licensing agreement with applied biosystems  inc for the taqman nuclease real time pcr assays with contractual minimums through the third quarter and thereafter we will receive royalty payments based on actual sales 
we expect license fee revenue to significantly increase as a result of including a full year of revenue under epoch s royalty agreement for the taqman nuclease real time pcr assays 
sponsored research revenue is nonrefundable money generated through the development agreement with hitachi see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in sponsored research revenue directly relates to the termination of the hitachi collaborative research agreement in august funding through this agreement was completed in the second quarter of the future with the termination of our sponsored research agreement with hitachi completed in the second quarter of we do not expect any revenue from hitachi in or thereafter 
we may enter into additional sponsored research projects in the future 
contracts and grants revenue is nonrefundable payments by various federal and state agencies for our research and development efforts awarded through contracts and grants 
contracts and grants revenue is recorded as the costs and expenses to perform the research are incurred  if the amount is reasonably commensurate with the effort expended and collection of the payment is reasonably assured 
under certain arrangements where funding is provided for contractually on a scheduled basis  revenue is recorded ratably over the term of the arrangement 
payments received in advance under these arrangements are recorded as deferred revenue until the expenses are incurred 
the decrease in contract and grant revenue in as compared to is a result of the completion of certain contracts and grants 
no new contracts or grants were entered into during to replace those that were completed 
the future the recognition of revenue under contracts and grants may vary from quarter to quarter and may result in significant fluctuations in operating results from year to year depending on the timing and quantity of agreements and contracts 
in the future  we expect contract and grant revenue to become a decreasing portion of our overall revenues 
we expect the majority of our revenue growth to be generated through an increase in product revenue 
cost and expenses cost of product sales year ended december  year ended december  difference difference in thousands in thousands cost of product sales cost of product sales includes the material  manufacturing labor  overhead costs and inventory impairment charges related to the cost of manufacturing our products 
in and all of our manufacturing costs related to the manufacturing of our nanochip system and the associated consumables 
in  approximately million of our manufacturing costs relates to the cost of manufacturing the nanochip system and associated consumables 
the nanochip system s gross margin has on a per unit basis remained low relative to our sales price  as our volume of production relative to the available capacity has remained low 
included in the cost of product sales in  and were charges of million  
table of contents  and million respectively  relating to underutilized capacity  excess instrumentation inventory and obsolete components 
the increase in charges in related to a large inventory build up that stemmed from purchase commitments from hitachi for the first generation of the nanochip system 
gross margins during and were also impacted by sales to certain customers under discount programs and by discounted sales to distributors 
in  we incurred approximately  of manufacturing costs for the products we acquired with the acquisition of synx and epoch 
the future 
as we are still in the early stages of commercialization of our product lines  we are still developing our models for accurately predicting the cost of our second generation of the nanochip system  point of care testing and the single analytic real time pcr products 
we currently believe that point of care testing and the single analytic real time pcr products will positively effect our gross margins 
we use outside vendors to manufacture our point of care nexus dx myocardial infarction product line  and our statusfirst congestive heart failure line 
we expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with excess production capacity within our manufacturing facility in as we transition from the first to second generation nanochip system 
because we are anticipating a significantly lower sale price per unit of our second generation nanochip system our cost of manufacturing will greatly depend on the number of units sold or rented to absorb our excess capacity and therefore lower the overhead and labor costs 
gross margins in future periods may additionally be impaired by minimum product royalties or potential adjustments made to reflect the impairment of inventory or intangible assets related to products sold 
research and development expenses year ended december  year ended december  difference difference in thousands in thousands research and development research and development expenses include the associated costs of salaries and benefits for scientific  engineering and operations personnel  costs associated with improving and refining our current products as well as development of potential new products and protocols  lab supplies  consulting  travel  facilities  and other expenditures associated with our research and product development activities 
in and our research and development primarily focused on the nanochip system and the associated consumables 
in  with our acquisition of synx  we added research and development related to point of care diagnostic systems as well as continued our research and development efforts on the second generation of the nanochip system and associated consumables 
in  research and development expenses related to our nanochip system and associated consumables remained consistent with the increase in research and development expenses related to our acquisitions of synx and epoch were offset by a general reduction in historical expense levels as well as a decision in to wind down all operations at nanogen recognomics gmbh 
of the total research and development expenses  approximately million is the result of our entry into the point of care market through the acquisition of synx in april research and development expenses in from the acquisition of epoch were not significant 
the future 
we expect our research and development expenditures to increase modestly from levels 
the increase is primarily the result of including a full year of research and development from our recent acquisitions of epoch and synx  partly offset by reduced expenditures from our nanogen recognomics subsidiary which ceased operations in in addition  included a million one time charge to write off in process research and development acquired from synx 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses year ended december  year ended december  difference difference in thousands in thousands selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses include sales and marketing personnel  tradeshows  promotional activities and materials  administrative personnel  legal  other professional expenses and general corporate expenses 
the increase in expenses in as compared to primarily relates to million in additional expenditures related to operating expenses related to the acquisition of synx  which had not been consolidated until april  the date of acquisition  approximately  related to the costs of sarbanes oxley act compliance and a  non cash charge related to a modification to extend the exercise period from days to days for vested options relating to a separation agreement with the company s then president and chief operating officer 
in addition  included  in operating expenses of epoch beginning december  the date of acquisition 
the decrease in expenses in as compared to is primarily the result of a headcount reduction in april as well as other cost savings initiatives 
the future 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenditures on a percentage basis will trend lower than the increases in our revenue 
we expect to incur integration costs  and ongoing operational costs related to the acquisitions of epoch and synx for a full year in  rather than only a portion of the year as occurred in on a consolidated basis  however  we expect to achieve significant synergies and savings by consolidating many of the general and administrative functions 
the savings from consolidation of general and administrative activities are expected to be offset by increased sales and marketing expenses required to support the various new product launches expected in expenses may also be further impacted by potential future business combinations or corporate development transactions 
charges for acquired in process research and development impairment for acquired technology year ended december  year ended december  difference difference in thousands in thousands charge for acquired in process research and development impairment for acquired technology rights we incurred a non cash charge of million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development or ipr d  related to the synx acquisition in the amount expended for ipr d represents the estimated fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the future 
we do not expect to incur any additional charges for acquired in process research and development related to the synx or epoch acquisitions 
however  if we acquire other companies in the future  we may incur additional material in process research and development charges 
the impairment of acquired technology rights relates to the difference between two of our license agreements assets carrying values and their estimated fair values 
in  we decided to restructure certain license agreements and it resulted in a million impairment expense 
the future 
as of december   we have approximately million in net book value remaining associated with acquired technology rights related to in licensing of various technologies 
we regularly review these assets for impairment and it is possible that additional impairment charges may be necessary in future periods 

table of contents other income the following table summarizes our other income for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference interest income  net other expense warrant valuation adjustment gain loss on sale of investments gain loss on foreign currency translation minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary total other income interest income  net interest income primarily relates to the interest we receive on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
our interest income slightly increased in as a result of the financing we secured during and the resulting higher balances of cash and investment balances during the year 
the million decrease in as compared to was a result of lower average cash and investment balances as well as lower yields on outstanding cash and investment balances 
warrant expense warrant expense relates to our acquisition of epoch in where we assumed warrants convertible into  shares of our common stock that contain a cash redemption feature which may be triggered under certain conditions 
we accounted for the fair value of these warrants in our purchase accounting  with a portion of the value assigned to the cash redemption liability  and the remaining portion recorded as additional paid in capital 
we are required to revalue the cash redemption liability related to these warrants quarterly using the black scholes valuation model with the changes in value accrued in the balance sheet and the associated non cash income or expense recorded in the income statement 
gain loss on the sale of investments the gain loss on the sale of investments in and primarily relate to the normal sales of our short term investments for operating capital 
in  however  when we sold  shares of combimatrix stock  obtained through a settlement agreement  we realized a loss on the sale of short term investments of million 
gain on foreign currency translation gain on foreign currency translation in primarily relates to the february decision to reorganize and discontinue all business activities of our majority owned subsidiary  nanogen recognomics gmbh 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation  and its related interpretations  when the business activity at this entity was discontinued we were required recognize a gain of million related to previously unrealized gains from foreign currency translation 
minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary related to our majority owned subsidiary  nanogen recognomics gmbh that was funded by an initial million investment from a minority interest investor 
through  we accounted for the minority interest in the subsidiary s expenditures in the cost and 
table of contents expenses section of the income statement 
to record the offset against the minority interest recorded in our balance sheet we recorded a gain in the other income section in the income statement 
the net effect of these entries was to reflect actual expenditures in the cost and expense section of our income statement while recognizing the contribution of the minority investor as a gain in the other income section of the income statement 
therefore  the effect on our net loss was eliminated 
in  when the minority interest investors funds were expended we recorded the expenditures in our cost and expense section of the income statement 
therefore  in the minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary was liquidity and capital resources short term and long term liquidity the following is a summary of our key liquidity measures for the years ended december   and in thousands december  december  december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments  available for sale total cash and cash equivalents and short term investment  available for sale current assets current liabilities working capital we believe that existing funds and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements at least through december  however  to provide greater flexibility  additional liquidity  ability to complete strategic mergers and acquisition and commercialize our products in development we anticipate raising additional funds through the sale of our common stock and or the issuance of debt 
from inception to december   we have financed our operations primarily by issuing our stock generating revenues using proceeds from our litigation settlement with combimatrix obtaining a modest amount of capital equipment long term financing we believe that our near term borrowing requirements and debt repayments will continue to involve a relatively small amount of cash 
we invest excess funds in short term investments that are classified as available for sale 
we believe that it is important to maintain a significant amount of cash and short term investments on hand to ensure that we have adequate resources to fund future research and development  provide working capital and assuage legal risks and challenges to our business model 
we expect that our existing capital resources  combined with anticipated product revenues  license fees and contract and grant funding  will be sufficient to support our planned operations  through at least the next twelve months 
however  this estimate is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements for will depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to potential business combinations  potential corporate development transactions  commercial success of our products  or lack thereof  the extent to which our products under 
table of contents development are successfully developed and gain market acceptance  the timing of regulatory actions regarding our potential products  the costs and timing of expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities  prosecution and enforcement of patents important to our business and any litigation related thereto  the results of clinical trials  competitive developments  and our ability to maintain existing collaborations and to enter into additional collaborative arrangements 
we have incurred negative cash flow from operations since inception and do not expect to generate positive cash flow to fund our operations for at least the next several years 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund our research and development programs  to scale up manufacturing activities and expand our sales and marketing efforts to support the commercialization of our products under development 
additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into collaborative agreements or other arrangements on unfavorable terms 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities of the years ended december   and is as follows in thousands december  december  december  net cash used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december    primarily related to our adjusted net losses  changes in working capital due to the product shipments and payments in liabilities 
the net cash used was primarily related to costs associated with commercializing our products including the expansion  development and support of our sales and marketing organization  the procurement of inventory pursuant to our manufacturing arrangement with hitachi  ltd  support of our continuing research and development efforts  legal fees relating to establishing  maintaining and defending our intellectual property portfolio  and costs associated with patent litigation 
the decline in cash used in operating activities in as compared to was primarily due to a reduction in force that was implemented in april the increase in as compared to is primarily the result of including the operations of synx beginning april  and epoch beginning on december   the respective dates of acquisition and an increase in our net loss 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in related to reinvesting the cash we realized from our common stock sales into purchasing available for sale short term investments 
net cash provided by investing activities in and related to net proceeds from the sale of short term investments  which was offset by the purchase of fewer short term investments ie we utilized short term investments to fund our operating and financing activities 
in  we issued million shares of common stock for the acquisition of synx and epoch and received million in cash  net of acquisition expenses 
capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities 
therefore  in  and we used cash to purchase  million and  in property and equipment to support the development of our product lines 

table of contents financing activities net cash provided by equity financing activities in related to the issuance of million common stock shares in two registered direct placements for net proceeds of million  the issuance of million common stock shares  related to the exercise of warrants issued in the private placement  for net proceeds of million  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of approximately million 
net cash provided by equity financing activities in related to the issuance of million common stock shares and warrants in a private placement for net proceeds of approximately million  and issuance of  common stock shares for million 
under our development agreement with hitachi we received  million and million in  and  respectively

as of december  we did not have any available funding under financing lines 
net cash provided by financing activities was offset by payments related to our debt obligations of   and million in  and  respectively  and the acquisition of treasury stock in and we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in s k a ii 
at december   our outstanding contractual obligations included in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations other commitments total less than year years years thereafter debt obligations other long term liabilities a operating leases purchase commitments b standby letters of credit c total contractual obligations other commitments a in connection with the agreement entered into with hitachi in july and since terminated in  we are required to repay fifty percent of the total contributions made by hitachi 
payment amounts are determined as a percentage of our gross nanochip cartridge sales until the liability is paid in full 
the current portion of the long term liability remains immaterial as payment amounts due under this obligation are determined as a percentage of the company s gross nanochip cartridge sales which have not been significant to date 
as such  we have classified the entire balance of this liability as long term 
this liability is non interest bearing and survives the termination of the agreement in we have received a total of approximately million since july under this arrangement  of which approximately million is reflected as a long term liability 

table of contents b our manufacturing agreement with hitachi  ltd 
hitachi requires that we provide annual purchase commitments to hitachi for our next generation nanochip workstations  the nanochip as of december   we had commitments to purchase approximately  of nanochip workstations through february  future purchase commitments will be determined based on product demand and inventory levels 
c payments are not required under the standby letters of credit and expire at various dates and therefore the table above does not reflect payment information over the five year period 
we are a party to development site agreements with various entities whereby we may be obligated to pay license fees or royalties for any customer owned or licensed intellectual property used to develop any our commercial products 
none of these agreements individually are considered material 
future accounting requirements on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas r on july  as permitted by sfas  we currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and the assumptions for the variables which impact the computation 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share elsewhere in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively  and million and million of research and development tax credits available to offset future federal and state income taxes  respectively 
the federal and state nol carryforwards are subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by the tax authorities 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin expiring in  unless previously utilized  and the state tax loss carryforwards will continue to expire in  unless previously utilized 
the federal and state r d tax credit carryforwards will begin expiring in unless previously utilized 
our initial public offering combined with the concurrent private placement  which occurred in april  may be perceived as a change of ownership under federal income tax regulations 
we also experienced a change of ownership in and in  we acquired synx s and epoch s nols 
pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of the our net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be limited due to cumulative changes in ownership of more than over a year period 
we may be subject to similar limitations on its canadian losses acquired from synx 
we have not performed a formal analysis to quantify the amount of possible limitations 
currently the net operating losses reflected above have not been reduced by potential limitations  however  a full valuation allowance has been placed on all deferred tax assets and  therefore  there is no material impact on our financial statements 
similar limitations may also apply to utilization

however  such limitations may have a material impact on our ability to utilize the nols
