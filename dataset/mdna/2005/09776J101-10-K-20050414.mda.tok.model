the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with its variable rate facilities  the company has entered into a derivative financial transaction in the form of an interest rate swap 
this interest rate swap  used to hedge a portion of the underlying variable rate facilities  matures in february the accounts receivable facility and credit agreement expire in october and october  respectively 
the company anticipates that it will be able to renew or replace these agreements with agreements on substantially comparable terms

capital expenditures for fiscal are planned at a range of million to million 
the company anticipates increasing store selling space in fiscal by expanding existing store locations 
the company anticipates its cash flows from operations  supplemented by borrowings under its credit agreement and proceeds from its accounts receivable facility  will be sufficient to satisfy its operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows from operations are impacted by consumer confidence  weather in the geographic markets served by the company  and economic and competitive conditions existing in the retail industry 
a downturn in any single factor or a combination of factors could have a material adverse impact upon the company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to operate its business 
the company has not identified any probable circumstances that would likely impair its ability to meet its cash requirements or trigger a default or acceleration of payment of the company s debt 
contractual obligations and commitments the following tables reflect the company s contractual obligations and commitments contractual obligations payment due by period dollars in thousands total within year years years after years debt principal capital leases building maintenance operating leases totals debt within the years category includes million of amounts currently outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  which expires in in addition  the company expects to make cash contributions to its supplementary pension plans in the amount of million  million  million  million and million for fiscal    and  respectively  and million in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter 
note in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides a more complete description of the company s supplementary pension plans 

table of contents commitments amount of expiration per period dollars in thousands total within year years years after years import merchandise letters of credit standby letters of credit surety bonds totals import letters of credit are primarily issued to support the importing of merchandise  which includes the company s private brand goods 
standby letters of credit are primarily issued as collateral for obligations related to general liability and workers compensation insurance

off balance sheet arrangements the company engages in securitization activities involving the company s proprietary credit card portfolio as a source of funding 
off balance sheet proprietary credit card securitizations provide a significant portion of the company s funding and are one of its primary sources of liquidity 
at january   off balance sheet securitized receivables represented of the company s funding 
gains and losses from securitizations are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the company relinquishes control of the transferred financial assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 and other related pronouncements 
the gain or loss on the sale of financial assets depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of sale 
based on the term of the securitization agreement less than one year and the fact that the credit card receivables that comprise the retained interests are short term in nature  the company has classified its retained interests as a current asset 
the company sells undivided percentage ownership interests in certain of its credit card accounts receivable to unrelated third parties under a million accounts receivable facility  which is described in further detail below and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the unrelated third parties  referred to as the conduit  have purchased a million interest in the accounts receivable under this facility at january  the company is responsible for servicing these accounts  retains a servicing fee and bears the risk of non collection limited to its retained interests in the accounts receivable 
associated off balance sheet assets and related debt were million at january  and million at january  upon the facility s termination  the conduit would be entitled to all cash collections on the accounts receivable until its investment million at january  and accrued discounts are repaid 
accordingly  upon termination of the facility  the assets of the facility would not be available to the company until all amounts due to the conduit have been paid in full 
based upon the terms of the accounts receivable facility  the accounts receivable transactions qualify for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles 
this treatment requires the company to account for transactions with the conduit as a sale of accounts receivable 
table of contents instead of reflecting the conduit s net investment as debt with a pledge of accounts receivable as collateral 
absent this sale treatment  the company s balance sheet would reflect additional accounts receivable and debt  which could be a factor in the company s ability to raise capital  however  results of operations would not be significantly impacted 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to merchandise returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  financings  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially lead to materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes its critical accounting policies are described below 
for a discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
the company continually monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience  how delinquent accounts ultimately charge off  aging of accounts and any specific customer collection issues identified eg  bankruptcy 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected defaults or bankruptcies  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be materially reduced 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
inventory valuation as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the retail inventory method using a last in  first out lifo cost basis 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and resulting gross margin is derived by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry 
use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are taken timely as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation at cost and resulting 
table of contents gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  result in individual inventory components with cost above related net realizable value 
factors that can lead to this result include applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost  selling price relationship and turnover  or applying the retail inventory method to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 
in addition  failure to take timely markdowns can result in an overstatement of cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
management believes that the company s retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation that approximates cost and results in carrying inventory in the aggregate at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records an adjustment for excess or old inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of merchandise demand for the selling season 
demand for merchandise can fluctuate greatly 
a significant increase in the demand for merchandise could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future merchandise demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may have understated or overstated the adjustment required for excess or old inventory 
if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued in the future  the company would be required to recognize such costs in costs of goods sold and reduce operating income at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is later determined to be undervalued  the company may have overstated the costs of goods sold in previous periods and would recognize additional operating income when such inventory is sold 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future merchandise demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or in economic conditions within the company s markets could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and reported operating results 
as is currently the case with many companies in the retail industry  the company s lifo calculations have yielded inventory increases in recent years due to deflation reflected in price indices used 
this is the result of the lifo method whereby merchandise sold is valued at the cost of more recent inventory purchases which the deflationary indices indicate to be lower  resulting in the general inventory on hand being carried at the older  higher costs 
given these higher values and the promotional retail environment  the company reduced the carrying value of its lifo inventories to a net realizable value nrv 
these reductions totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
inherent in these nrv assessments are significant management judgments and estimates regarding future merchandise selling costs and pricing 
should these estimates prove to be inaccurate  the company may have overstated or understated its inventory carrying value 
in such cases  the company s operating results would ultimately be impacted 
vendor allowances as is standard industry practice  the company receives allowances from merchandise vendors as reimbursement for charges incurred on marked down merchandise 
vendor allowances are generally credited to costs of goods sold  provided the allowance is collectable  for merchandise either permanently marked down or sold  not predicated on a future purchase  not predicated on a future increase in the purchase price from the vendor  and authorized by internal management 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the company reflects the allowances as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory 
additionally  the company receives allowances from vendors in connection with cooperative advertising programs 
the company reviews advertising allowances received from each vendor to ensure reimbursements are for specific  incremental and identifiable advertising costs incurred by the company to sell the vendor s products 
if a vendor reimbursement exceeds the costs 
table of contents incurred by the company  the excess reimbursement is recorded as a reduction of cost purchases from the vendor and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
all other amounts are recognized by the company as a reduction of the related advertising costs that have been incurred and reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves the company summarizing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items eg  allowance for doubtful accounts for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and  to the extent the company does not believe recovery of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance in a period  an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the statement of income 
net deferred tax assets were million and million at january  and january   respectively 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  the company considered whether it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  or a portion thereof  will not be realized 
the company considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code section 
as a result  the company concluded that a valuation allowance against a portion of the net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
a total valuation allowance of million and million was recorded at january  and january   respectively 
the valuation allowance increase was due to final purchase accounting adjustments during the third quarter of fiscal and the impact of general operations and tax deductions in fiscal if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company may need to adjust its valuation allowance  which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
the company recorded million of net deferred tax assets in connection with the october  acquisition of elder beerman  a valuation allowance of million was established against these deferred tax assets 
any future reduction to the valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of elder beerman would first reduce intangible assets and then  to the extent the valuation allowance reduction exceeds the current book value of intangible assets approximately million at january   would reduce the current income tax provision 
as of january   the company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of million and million  respectively  which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income subject to certain limitations imposed by section these net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in fiscal through fiscal the company acquired federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of million and million  respectively  in connection with the acquisition of elder beerman 
as of january   the company had alternative minimum tax credits and general business credits in the amount of million and million  respectively 
both credits are also subject to the limitations imposed by section the alternative minimum tax credits are available indefinitely  and the general business credits expire in fiscal and fiscal the company acquired these alternative minimum tax credits and general business credits in connection with the acquisition of elder beerman 

table of contents legislative changes currently proposed by certain states in which the company operates could have a materially adverse impact on future operating results of the company 
these legislative changes principally involve state income tax laws 
long lived assets property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in the company s business model or capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s estimates 
in cases where the company determines that the useful life of property  fixtures and equipment should be shortened  the company depreciates the net book value in excess of the salvage value over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or leasehold improvements could also result in shortened useful lives 
net property  fixtures and equipment amounted to million and million at january  and january   respectively 
the company assesses  on a store by store basis  the impairment of identifiable long lived assets primarily property  fixtures and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance of stores relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of assets or overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends for a sustained period 
sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 requires the company to recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the company s best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
estimates of fair value represent the company s best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
should cash flow estimates differ significantly from actual results  an impairment could arise and materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
given the seasonality of operations  impairment is not conclusive  in many cases  until after the holiday period in the fourth quarter is concluded 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type  store location  current marketplace awareness of the company s private label brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results 
if conditions prove to be substantially different from the company s expectations  the carrying value of new stores long lived assets may ultimately become impaired 
in fiscal and  the company evaluated the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  impairment losses of approximately million and million were recorded in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal and  respectively 
included in the impairment loss in fiscal is million related to the write down of an intangible asset at one store location 

table of contents in fiscal  a charge of million was recorded in depreciation and amortization expense for the write off of duplicate information systems software due to the acquisition of elder beerman 
this charge arose due to the decision to use elder beerman s point of sale system in all of the company s stores 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill was million at january  and january  intangible assets are principally comprised of lease interests that relate to below market rate leases acquired in store acquisitions completed in fiscal years through  which were adjusted to reflect fair market value 
these lease related interests are being amortized on a straight line method 
at january   these lease related interests had average remaining lives of seventeen years for amortization purposes 
net intangible assets totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 the company reviews goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
the company determines fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis methodology  which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability of acquired businesses 
it is the company s policy to conduct impairment testing based on its most current business plans  which reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
if actual results prove inconsistent with company assumptions and judgments  the company could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
the company completed a review of the carrying value of goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 at january  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
securitizations a significant portion of the company s funding is through off balance sheet credit card securitizations via sales of certain accounts receivable through an accounts receivable facility the facility 
the sale of receivables is to the bon ton receivables partnership  lp btrlp  a special purpose entity as defined by sfas no 
btrlp is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
btrlp may sell accounts receivable with a purchase price up to million through the facility to a conduit on a revolving basis 
the company sells accounts receivable through securitizations with servicing retained 
when the company securitizes  it surrenders control over the transferred assets and accounts for the transaction as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange 
the company allocates the previous carrying amount of the securitized receivables between the assets sold and retained interests  based on their relative estimated fair values at the date of sale 
securitization income is recognized at the time of the sale  and is equal to the excess of the fair value of the assets obtained principally cash over the allocated cost of the assets sold and transaction costs 
during the revolving period of each accounts receivable securitization  securitization income is recorded representing estimated gains on the sale of new receivables to the conduit on a continuous basis to replenish the investors interest in securitized receivables that have been repaid by the credit card account holders 
fair value estimates used in the recognition of securitization income require certain assumptions of payment  default  servicing costs direct and indirect and interest rates 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  the impact is recognized as a component of securitization income 
the company estimates the fair value of retained interests in securitizations based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the cash flows of the interest only strip are estimated as the excess of the weighted average finance charge yield on each pool of receivables sold over the sum of the interest rate paid to the note holder  the servicing fee and an estimate of future credit losses over 
table of contents the life of the receivables 
cash flows are discounted from the date the cash is expected to become available to the company 
these cash flows are projected over the life of the receivables using payment  default  and interest rate assumptions that the company believes would be used by market participants for similar financial instruments subject to prepayment  credit and interest rate risk 
the cash flows are discounted using an interest rate that the company believes a purchaser unrelated to the seller of the financial instrument would demand 
as all estimates used are influenced by factors outside the company s control  there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates  making it reasonably possible that they could change in the near term 
any adverse change in the company s assumptions could materially impact securitization income 
the company recognized securitization income of million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in income in fiscal relative to fiscal was principally due to increased sales of accounts receivable through the facility  resulting in a million finance charge income increase  largely offset by higher interest costs  credit losses  and servicing fees 
the decreased securitization income in fiscal relative to fiscal was principally a reflection of decreased sales of accounts receivable  resulting in a million decrease in finance charge income  partially offset by a million reduction in interest costs 
operating leases the company leases a majority of its retail stores under operating leases 
many of the lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and contingent rent provisions or some combination of these items 
the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the accounting lease term  which includes cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
in calculating straight line rent expense  the company utilizes an accounting lease term that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
additionally  the commencement date of the accounting lease term reflects the earlier of the date the company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date the company takes possession of the building for initial construction and setup 
in a february letter to the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec clarified its position regarding certain lease accounting practices 
the sec s letter specifically addressed the depreciable life of leasehold improvements  rent holidays and landlord tenant incentives 
similar to other retailers  the company reviewed its historical treatment of these lease issues 
after assessing its findings using the guidelines in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 the company recorded a cumulative pre tax expense of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded that restatement of the company s financial statements for prior years would not be required

sfas no 
r also requires that benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the company is unable to estimate what those amounts will be in the future as they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
based on the variable rate facilities outstanding at january   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million charge to interest expense 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with its variable rate facilities  the company entered into a derivative financial transaction in the form of an interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap is used to hedge a portion of the underlying variable rate facilities 
the swap is a qualifying hedge and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap 
the company currently holds a variable to fixed rate swap with a notional amount of million with one financial institution 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  rather  it is used as the basis to calculate amounts due and to be received under the rate swap 
during fiscal and  the company did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following table provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at january  for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average pay and receive interest rates by expected maturity date 
for additional discussion of the company s interest rate swap  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements

see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the company s quarterly results for fiscal and due to the fixed nature of certain costs  selling  general and administrative expenses are typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first half of each fiscal year 

table of contents because of the seasonality of the company s business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
in addition  quarterly operating results are impacted by the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores and the closing and remodeling of existing stores 
the company does not believe inflation had a material effect on operating results during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflationary adjustments in the future
