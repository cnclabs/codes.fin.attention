item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  compared to and compared to 
competition the company competes in a market characterized by technological innovation  extensive research efforts and significant competition 
in general  the theraseed and i seed devices compete with conventional methods of treating localized cancer  including  but not limited to  radical prostatectomy rp and external beam radiation therapy ebrt which includes intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt  as well as competing permanent devices 
rp currently represents the most common medical treatment for early stage  localized prostate cancer 
ebrt is also a well established method of treatment and is widely accepted for patients who represent a poor surgical risk or whose prostate cancer has advanced beyond the stage for which surgical treatment is indicated 
management believes that if general conversion from these treatment options or other established or conventional procedures to brachytherapy treatment does occur  such conversion will likely be the result of a combination of equivalent or better efficacy  reduced incidence of side effects and complications  lower cost  other quality of life issues and pressure by health care providers and patients 
in addition  a third party study commissioned by the company indicated the direct historical correlation between fair reimbursement for brachytherapy and the number of brachytherapy procedures performed see also item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  medicare developments 
several companies produce and distribute palladium and iodine seeds  which compete directly with the theraseed and i seed devices 
management believes that theragenics has competitive advantages over these companies including  but not limited to i its proprietary production processes that have been developed and patented  ii its record of reliability and safety in its manufacturing operations  iii the time and resources required for competitors production capabilities to ramp up to commercial production on a scale comparable to theragenics  iv outsourcing of the company s cancer information center to healthcare specialist  telerx  a subsidiary of merck pharmaceutical and v its direct sales force  the non exclusive distribution agreements that the company currently has in place  and the strategic alliance with international urology network  which allow it to leverage multiple distribution channels and access multiple marketing approaches and philosophies 
at any point in time  management of theragenics and or its non exclusive distributors may change their respective pricing policies for the theraseed or i seed in the case of theragenics device in order to take advantage of market opportunities or respond to competitive situations 
responding to market opportunities and competitive situations  including but not limited to competitor selling tactics  could have an adverse effect on the prices of the theraseed or i seed device and or could have a favorable effect on market share and volumes  while failure to do so could adversely affect market share and volumes although per unit pricing could possibly be maintained 
in addition to the competition from the procedures and companies noted above  many companies  both public and private  are researching new and innovative methods of preventing and treating cancer 
in addition  many companies  including many large  well known pharmaceutical  medical device and chemical companies that have significant resources available to them  are engaged in radiological pharmaceutical and device research

theragenics is the world s largest producer of palladium  the radioactive isotope that supplies the therapeutic radiation for its theraseed device 
physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers  primarily located in the united states  utilize the theraseed device 
the theraseed device has also been approved for marketing throughout the member countries of the european union by obtaining its ce mark 
sales of the theraseed device in europe have not been significant 
the majority of sales are channeled through two third party distributors 
the company also sells its theraseed devices directly to physicians 
early in the company diversified its product line with the purchase of the us iodine prostate brachytherapy business of bebig isotopen und medizintechnik gmbh bebig  formerly distributed by isotope products laboratories both subsidiaries of a publicly traded german company  eckert ziegler ag 
the purchase gives theragenics exclusive us manufacturing and distribution rights to an fda cleared iodine based medical device for the treatment of prostate cancer 
theragenics began distribution of the iodine based medical device early in  and subsequently began to produce i seed the theragenics iodine based medical device early in  utilizing the automated production equipment procured in the business acquisition 
the company sells the i seed device directly to physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers 
the non exclusive distributors of the theraseed device have no distribution rights for the i seed device 
non exclusive rights to distribute the theraseed device in europe were granted to bebig as part of the transaction 
the company believes that the ability to provide both theraseed and i seed devices enhances the company s ability to market to direct customers who seek a single source for both palladium and iodine brachytherapy seeds 
the product line and equipment purchase will not affect the company s existing non exclusive distribution agreements for the theraseed device 
the us department of energy doe has granted theragenics access to unique doe technology  known as plasma separation process or psp  for use in production of isotopes  including palladium the psp operation 
the company has constructed a facility in oak ridge  tennessee to house the equipment  infrastructure and work force necessary to support the production of isotopes  including palladium  using this doe technology 
the building and the psp became operational during the latter half of the company also has access to and has made investments in other unique doe resources 
additional equipment in the amount of million  which is physically located within doe facilities in oak ridge  has not yet been placed in service and is recorded as construction in progress on the accompanying balance sheets 
due to delays by the doe s primary contractor in oak ridge  the company currently anticipates that this additional equipment will become operational during the first half of as a result of the sensitive nature of the psp equipment and other unique doe resources and facilities  the specialized technology involved and the restrictions on access to unique doe operated facilities  the company has contracted with the doe s primary contractor for its oak ridge facilities to handle certain technical and operational services that are critical to the operation  including designing and fabricating new parts and modifications to the equipment and doe facilities  operating and providing ongoing access to doe facilities  and providing access to other doe resources 
the success of the psp operation is  in part  dependent on the continued cooperation of the doe and its primary contractor  which could be adversely affected by future changes in governmental program priorities and funding 
if there are problems with the operation or modification of the doe operated facilities  problems with access to other doe resources  or if unforeseen challenges arise  the psp operation may not be successful or the costs or availability associated with the psp operation could be adversely affected 
additionally  as a result of the sensitive nature of the psp equipment and the specialized technology involved  the doe is able to terminate the company s access in the event of national emergency or in the interest of national defense  or require the company to perform programmatic work involving use of the technology for the doe in connection with carrying out its governmental mission 
the company would be entitled to compensation in the event of termination in connection with national emergency or defense or for programmatic use of the technology for the doe 
use of the psp by theragenics is also subject to classification and export control restrictions imposed by the doe and the us government 
in connection with the company s ongoing program targeted at diversifying its future revenue stream  the company continues to explore new applications for psp technology 
among other things  the psp technology enables the company to conduct feasibility runs designed to validate isotope usage in various diverse industries and potential markets 
the company is actively looking at other opportunities for utilization of the psp  including  but not limited to  being active in the federal budget process  and working to ensure that the psp s capabilities are known to federal agencies such as the departments of defense and energy 
in the first quarter of the company s oak ridge operations began to enrich palladium  which can be activated in a nuclear reactor to produce palladium the enriched palladium  along with access to specialized reactor and related capabilities  could potentially supply the palladium radioisotope to support theraseed production  if necessary 
in addition  the production of palladium allowed the company to study the psp and its interaction with palladium in order to calibrate the psp and determine predictable yields generated by the psp 
the company completed psp production of palladium at the oak ridge facility during october  and completed chemical recovery and processing in december the company sold the excess palladium metal remaining after the production of palladium for approximately  in november  which reduced the carrying value of inventory by this amount 
as a result of the cessation of production of palladium at the oak ridge facility  in the company will cease capitalization of all of the palladium production costs 
the company s diversification program also includes a clinical trial using a palladium device  called the therasource intravascular brachytherapy system  designed to prevent restenosis or renarrowing of arteries following treatment of peripheral vascular disease by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty 
following the approval of the investigational device exemption granted by the u 
s 
food and drug administration fda in august to initiate the therap clinical trial  theragenics began a clinical trial using a palladium device patent pending early in theragenics closed enrollment in the therap trial early in the second quarter of at patients 
eighteen patients have progressed to the six month endpoint and two patients have elected to discontinue follow up in the trial 
none of the twenty patients treated with the therasource device has experienced a device related adverse event 
the company is currently assessing the results of the trial to determine the most appropriate course of action going forward 
during the second quarter of  the company filed an investigational device exemption ide with the fda to begin a human clinical trial for the therasight ocular brachytherapy system  a device intended to treat exudative wet age related macular degeneration amd  a disease that leads to loss of eyesight and in some cases complete blindness 
the ide was approved by the fda on july   and enrollment commenced in the fourth quarter of to test the safety and feasibility of the therasight device 
the company has patents pending on the therasight device and plans to run the trial at six separate clinical sites and expects to treat approximately patients 
the first three patients were treated in the therasight trial at emory eye center in atlanta  georgia 
the company continues to be mindful of the potential competition in this market  including but not limited to  existing treatments and other on going clinical trials in this area 
research and development expenditures are likely to continue as our diversification initiatives are pursued 
the company has also identified potential opportunities  utilizing its cyclotrons  for production of radiochemical products  which are typically used in medical nuclear imaging procedures 
during  the company began regular shipments to customers of two radiochemicals  produced on the company s cyclotrons 
the revenue recognized during the twelve months ended december  was not material 
the company has received a drug master file for these products from the fda  which will potentially allow access to a wider range of customers 
the company also continues to assess the markets for other radiochemicals it is able to produce using the existing cyclotrons 
these developments could  if pursued  increase research and development expenses 
radiochemical product sales are not expected to have a material impact on revenue during the company is also searching for  reviewing and evaluating external opportunities for diversification in the form of joint ventures  partnerships  and or acquisitions of technologies  products and companies 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decline in revenue was primarily due to an decrease in unit sales of the theraseed device  partially offset by  of revenue recognized during for ancillary services to one distributor 
i seed unit sales represented approximately of total unit sales in both and the average selling price of the theraseed device was consistent during when compared to the average selling price during during  the company sold approximately of total unit sales of the company s palladium theraseed device and iodine i seed device directly to customers compared to of total unit sales theraseed and i seed directly to customers during total revenue from sales to direct customers theraseed and i seed was of total product revenue during compared to of total product revenue during revenue from distributors  including the  of revenue generated from ancillary services  decreased approximately during compared to currently  the company has non exclusive distribution agreements in place with two companies for the distribution of the theraseed device  a reduction from the four distributors in place at the beginning of during  cr bard acquired two of the other three non exclusive distributors of the theraseed device 
comparing unit sales to cr bard during to the same three distributor s unit sales during on a combined basis shows a increase for the twelve months ended december  compared to the corresponding period of cr bard has exercised its option to extend its distribution agreement with the company through december the domestic and international distribution agreements with the other distributor  oncura  allow each party the right to give notice of non renewal of the agreements at the end of december  which would be effective december  during december  the company was notified by oncura that it would not be renewing its distribution agreements effective december  sales to oncura during declined by compared to the corresponding period of the company believes that sales through oncura have been adversely affected by the distributor s efforts to market prostate cancer treatments other than the theraseed device or brachytherapy 
the company and oncura are currently arbitrating claims arising in connection with the company s non exclusive distribution agreement with oncura 
oncura claims that the company has not addressed oncura s concerns about pricing by renegotiating pricing in good faith 
oncura is seeking a change in the pricing terms of the distribution agreement through the arbitration proceeding  and has indicated that it will seek to recover a portion of payments previously made 
the company filed a counterclaim against oncura alleging that oncura breached its obligations under the distribution agreement concerning marketing brachytherapy products and the use of the company s trademarks 
the arbitrators have been appointed and the parties are conducting discovery 
management believes that oncura s claims are without merit and is opposing them vigorously 
management believes the company has meritorious counter claims against oncura 
in addition to the impact of disappointing performance by one of the two distributors of theraseed  management believes that the brachytherapy industry continues to be affected by competition from alternative therapies  changes in medicare reimbursement  declining prices for iodine and palladium seeds  competitors selling tactics and the effects of consolidation in the industry 
at any point in time  theragenics and or its non exclusive distributors may change their respective pricing policies for the theraseed or i seed in the case of theragenics device in order to take advantage of market opportunities or respond to competitive situations 
responding to market opportunities and competitive situations could have an adverse effect on the prices of the theraseed or i seed device and could have a favorable effect or prevent an unfavorable effect on market share and volumes 
conversely  the company and its non exclusive distributors could individually and independently decide to maintain per unit pricing under certain competitive situations that could adversely affect current or potential market share and volumes 
the company s licensing fees revenue represents licensing payments for the company s therasphere technology 
such licensing fees are not expected to become material in the foreseeable future 
cost of sales was million during compared to million in gross profit was approximately of revenue in  compared to in the increase in gross profit percentage in compared to was largely due to the capitalization of costs associated with the first production of palladium material using the psp technology at the company s oak ridge  tennessee facility 
total production costs capitalized were approximately million during the total cost of the inventory  including the material and production costs capitalized  is million and is included in work in process inventory in the accompanying december  balance sheet 
the company completed psp production of palladium at the oak ridge facility during october  and completed chemical recovery and processing in december the company sold the excess palladium metal remaining after the production of palladium for approximately  in november  which reduced the carrying value of inventory by this amount 
as a result of the cessation of production of palladium at the oak ridge facility  in the company will cease capitalization of all of the palladium production costs 
the gross margin in was also favorably impacted by  of revenue from ancillary services to one distributor during the twelve months ended december  gross margin during was negatively impacted by the considerable fixed cost component of theragenics operations in combination with lower revenue during the twelve months ended december  compared to the corresponding period of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in  compared to  was due primarily to costs incurred to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  an increase in professional fees for assistance in various key strategic initiatives  an increase in marketing and advertising costs and an increase in compensation and related expenses due primarily to the expansion of the direct sales force 
r d expenses increased to million  or of revenue in  from million  or of revenue in the increase in research and development expense during was primarily attributable to an increase in costs to support the company s peripheral vascular and macular degeneration programs and include the cost of palladium produced for use in r d initiatives see overview above 
other income  primarily comprising interest income  was million in compared to  in the increase during is primarily the result of better returns on the company s investments as a result of higher interest rates in the company s investments consist primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality corporate and municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
funds available for investment have and will continue to be utilized for the company s current and future expansion programs  r d activities  and strategic opportunities for growth and diversification 
as funds continue to be used for these programs and activities  and as interest rates continue to change  management expects other income to fluctuate accordingly 
the company s effective income tax rate was a benefit of during the twelve months ended december  compared to a benefit of during the twelve months ended december  the company s income tax rate in each period differed from statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits generated by the company s investments in its expansion projects  research activities and tax exempt interest income 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decline in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of the theraseed device 
theraseed sales direct to customers and to third party distributors remained comparable as a percentage of total theraseed sales in and although the average selling price of theraseed remained steady in when compared to  the overall decrease in revenues is the direct result of the decrease in total unit sales  both direct and to third party distributors 
the company has non exclusive distribution agreements in place with two companies for the distribution of the theraseed device  a reduction from the four distributors in place at the beginning of during  one of the non exclusive distributors of the theraseed device acquired two of the other three non exclusive distributors of the theraseed device 
sales to this acquiring distributor  combined with sales to the distributors it acquired  decreased approximately in as compared to the company believes that the decrease in unit sales throughout the year was a combination of several factors including disappointing sales by the company s non exclusive distribution partners  consolidation and ownership changes in the brachytherapy market  continued deep discounting in the market by many competitors  including iodine seeds throughout the year and palladium seeds in the latter part of the year  and uncertainty related to changing rules for medicare reimbursement see medicare developments below 
the company diversified its product line in with the introduction of i seed  an iodine based brachytherapy device see overview above 
the company believes the ability to provide both devices  ie  theraseed and i seed  will allow access to direct customers otherwise not available 
i seed sales represented approximately of total brachytherapy product sales during the non exclusive distributors of the theraseed device have no distribution rights for the i seed device 
the company s licensing fees revenue represents licensing payments for the company s therasphere technology 
such licensing fees are not expected to become material in the foreseeable future 
at any point in time  theragenics and or its non exclusive distributors may change their respective pricing policies for the theraseed device in order to take advantage of market opportunities or to respond to competitive situations 
responding to market opportunities and competitive situations could have an adverse effect on the prices of the theraseed device and could have a favorable effect or prevent an unfavorable effect on market share and volumes 
failure to respond to market opportunities and competitive situations in order to maintain per unit pricing could adversely affect current or potential market share and volumes and or result in a decrease in margins 
cost of sales was million during compared to million in gross profit was approximately of revenue in  compared to in the decrease in gross profit percentage in compared to was largely due to the considerable fixed cost component of theragenics operations  partially offset by the transfer of material and resources to support research and development initiatives and the completion of depreciation  early in  of the first cyclotron placed in service 
approximately million of operating expenses related to the psp facility  including approximately million of depreciation  were recognized in cost of sales during compared to million during the second half of in addition  as a result of the purchase of the us iodine prostate brachytherapy business of bebig early in see overview above  approximately  of operating expenses were included in cost of sales during for direct costs related to the i seed device 
the i seed production line at the company s buford facility became operational early in as a result  depreciation and costs incurred to support this production line will be included in cost of sales during selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in  compared to  was due primarily to an increase in headcount and expenses associated with the direct sales force as a result of hiring brachytherapy specialists to promote the theraseed brand 
sg a expenses were also higher during as a result of outsourcing the company s cancer information center to healthcare specialist  telerx  a subsidiary of merck pharmaceutical  and a significant increase in directors and officers liability insurance premiums 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the start up expenses related to the psp facility  which became operational in the second half of see overview above and liquidity and capital resources below 
r d expenses increased to million  or of revenue in  from million  or of revenue in the increase in r d expenses in was a result of the company s diversification initiatives geared to expand the application of palladium to other oncological and non oncological uses  and to explore options for using the company s expertise and capabilities in other areas 
the bulk of these expenses were associated with the company s peripheral vascular and macular degeneration programs and include the cost of palladium produced for use in r d initiatives see overview above 
other income  primarily comprising interest income  was  in compared to  in the company s investments consist primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
funds available for investment have been and will continue to be utilized for the company s current and future expansion programs and r d activities  and may be used for the acquisition of technologies  products or companies consistent with the goals of theragenics 
as funds continue to be used for these programs and activities  and as interest rates continue to change  management expects other income to fluctuate accordingly 
the company s effective income tax rate was a benefit of in  primarily due to permanent differences related to tax exempt interest income on municipal and government securities  compared to an expense of in the company s income tax rate in each period differed from statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits generated by the company s investments in its expansion projects  research activities  and tax exempt interest income 
critical accounting policies the financial statements of theragenics corporation are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
the company s estimates can result in differences from the actual useful lives of certain assets 
the company currently owns and operates cyclotrons  the first of which entered service in each of the company s cyclotrons is depreciated using an estimated year life 
management s estimate of the useful life of these cyclotrons is based on the company s experience to date with these cyclotrons 
based on experience gained relative to the operation  refurbishment  and maintenance of the cyclotrons  management believes there is a substantive basis for the current depreciable lives of the cyclotrons 
although the older cyclotrons require increased maintenance  all the cyclotrons remain in service  including fully depreciated cyclotrons  because the material produced by each machine is required for ongoing operations and the company s current research and development initiatives 
the psp equipment was placed in service during the second half of and is depreciated using an estimated fifteen year life 
the psp equipment utilizes specialized  unique technology 
management will continue to periodically examine estimates used for depreciation for reasonableness 
if the company should determine that the useful life of property  plant or equipment should be shortened or lengthened  depreciation expense would be adjusted accordingly for the remaining useful life lives of the identified asset s 
a significant portion of the company s depreciable assets is utilized in the production of its product 
management assesses the impairment of its depreciable assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
in the event the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
management believes that no impairment of depreciable assets exists as of december  it is possible  however  that management s estimates concerning the realizability of the company s depreciable assets could change in the future 
goodwill 
early in the company entered into an agreement to purchase the brachytherapy business of bebig isotopen und medizintechnik gmbh bebig  a subsidiary company of eckert ziegler ag 
a total of approximately million was paid in connection with the acquisition and the payments were allocated between the fair value of the assets in the amount of million and million to goodwill 
the equipment became operational during the first quarter of the company has determined that the production line will be amortized over a fifteen year life 
the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to expense and must be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the company operates as one reporting unit and therefore compares its book value to market value market capitalization plus a control premium 
if fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if book value exceeds market value  the second step of the impairment test is preformed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for this step the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of november  and determined that goodwill was not impaired and no impairment charge was recorded 
intangible assets with definite lives are being amortized and this amortization is included in the accompanying statements of operations

medicare developments previously  theragenics theraseed device and other brachytherapy seeds fell within various transitional pass through codes  which were separate from the procedure payment codes that comprise much of medicare s outpatient prospective payment system opps 
on april   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms implemented changes in hospital payments for brachytherapy and other services provided under medicare s opps for the remainder of through december   cms bundled a portion of pass through reimbursement for all brachytherapy seeds and other devices with the associated procedure codes  thereby effectively sheltering seeds from pro rata reductions that would otherwise have applied under medicare law 
to the extent that these pass through device costs exceeded the bundled amount  the remaining cost was subject to a pro rated reduction in reimbursement 
during  cms further revised its policies by bundling the costs of the prostate brachytherapy procedure  as well as the costs for catheters  needles and all seeds  into two new codes for prostate brachytherapy one for palladium and one for iodine 
by creating two codes and setting separate reimbursement amounts for palladium seed brachytherapy including the theraseed device and iodine seed brachytherapy including the i seed device  cms made an important  positive change in its final rule for compared to its initial proposal published on august  specifically  the per patient reimbursement amount under the final rule for palladium prostate brachytherapy exceeded the original payment amount proposed in august for both palladium and iodine the final per patient amount for palladium prostate brachytherapy also exceeded the payment amount for iodine prostate brachytherapy 
to the extent that the brachytherapy costs for either seed  for an individual patient exceeded the bundled payment amount during  the remaining costs could not be submitted for additional reimbursement 
on december   the president signed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of into law that provides for improved reimbursement and coding policies in and beyond for brachytherapy seeds sources under medicare s opps 
to reflect the changes in the statute  cms revised its november  final rule by publishing a new interim final rule for on january  the brachytherapy provisions in the medicare legislation  which went into effect on january   require medicare to unbundle the cost of the seeds from the costs of the brachytherapy procedure  catheters and needles under the opps 
more specifically  the medicare legislation requires medicare to reimburse hospitals for each brachytherapy seed source furnished between january  to december  based on the hospital s costs for each patient calculated from the hospital s charges adjusted by the hospital s specific cost to charge ratio 
this means that hospital reimbursement is no longer limited to or dictated by the reimbursement amounts assigned to the brachytherapy codes  which cms used in with respect to coding  the legislation requires the medicare program to create and use coding that classifies brachytherapy seeds sources separately from all the other services and items reimbursed under the opps 
these separate codes for brachytherapy seeds sources must be used in a manner that reflects the type of radioactive isotope for example  palladium  the radioactive intensity and the number of brachytherapy seeds sources used to treat each patient 
depending on the number of seeds needed to treat each prostate cancer patient  the total reimbursement for the combination of the unbundled procedure codes and seeds for the payment methodology in place until at least december  may be higher than the bundled payment amounts 
the legislation enacted in also directs the us general accounting office gao to conduct a study examining future payment policies for brachytherapy seeds 
the company believes its efforts in assisting policymakers in formulating and revising medicare policies to recognize the unique aspects of classification and reimbursement that apply to brachytherapy devices such as theraseed were pivotal to the enactment of the improved medicare legislation for brachytherapy seeds sources 
the company plans to continue working to assist policymakers regarding these important issues in the future 
the company believes that the significant number of proposed and actual changes in medicare coding and reimbursement policy in the years preceding and during  created confusion for hospitals and doctors  which may have had a detrimental impact on sales in and see results of operations above 
in addition  due to the fact that the medicare rules governing coding of brachytherapy seeds sources have undergone significant change during the past few years  the company believes that medicare reimbursement may continue to create confusion for hospitals and doctors going forward 
in that regard  management continues to closely monitor any effects of the reimbursement structure on the brachytherapy market as it continues to evaluate pricing  marketing and distribution strategies 
the company continues to engage a consulting firm specializing in reimbursement practices to help communicate brachytherapy reimbursement guidelines to customers
