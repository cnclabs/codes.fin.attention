industry trends industry analyst frost and sullivan in their recent world web conferencing market report separates the web conferencing vendor community into three distinct groups total service providers tsps  web conferencing software providers  and resellers of tsp and software providers 
the difference between tsps and software providers is that the tsps only offer web conferencing as an asp service 
software providers offer web conferencing as solutions that can be purchased and owned by customers whether the software is installed internally or purchased by customers and hosted by the provider 
ilinc competes in the software provider market 
although most of our major competitors compete only in the tsp market including webex  live meeting  and raindance  the web conferencing software market is the faster growing segment  representing about million of the current web conferencing market 
this market s projected growth is about cagr between and as compared with the service provider market which is growing about compound annual growth rate cagr for the same time period and is forecast to outgrow the service provider market by the end of as with many technologies that achieve mainstream success  the decision to purchase web conferencing is shifting from individual departments to it 
several factors are driving this shift  including the need for organizations to centralize on one vendor instead of having several different vendors for web or audio conferencing services for different parts of the organization 
the requirements of the it organization are often distinctly different from the purchase requirements of a department such as sales or marketing 
to successfully sell to the market as it continues to mature  vendors need to be able to provide solutions that can scale and can meet customer needs at any point of their adoption cycle whether their specific organization is just beginning to use web conferencing in one part of the organization or if they are ready to deploy an enterprise wide solution 
another important trend in the industry is the convergence of communication technologies such as audio and web conferencing and the increase in demand for a single source for both of these capabilities 
frost and sullivan has noted in a separate report on audio conferencing that the demand for integrated audio  web  and video conferencing solutions continues to surge as end user needs for easy to use  single source solutions swell 
developing and providing a truly converged user environment and experience  including the integration of audio  web and video conferencing technologies is essential 
with the addition of audio conferencing capabilities from our acquisition of glyphic communications  we have been able to provide a single source for deeply integrated web  audio  video as well as voice over ip 
increasingly  the option a vendor chooses for web conferencing determines their selection for audio conferencing 
ilinc has already made significant progress in selling audio conferencing to the ilinc customer base and we actively cross sell all of our products and services to all customers 
we believe that another benefit of the integrated conferencing approach is customer retention 
according to the same frost and sullivan report  when web conferencing and audio conferencing are sold together as an integrated package there is a significant increase in retention of the audio conferencing service 
we are continuing to create incentives for our audio customers to be both web and audio customers to drive this retention 
market position differentiators we view our position in the market as the best solution for the enterprise wide buyer that has already adopted web conferencing  as well as organizations that believe their usage of web conferencing will grow quickly 
as mentioned earlier  a growing number of these organizations are using four or more different vendors for web or audio conferencing services and  therefore  not realizing the economies of scale that consolidating to one or two vendors for these services can provide 
there are also other important considerations revolving around web conferencing such as security and bandwidth availability that are forcing the buying decision for web and audio conferencing out of the business units and into the it department 
we believe that our solution uniquely maps to critical it requirements among these mature buyers in five important areas 
first  we offer web conferencing software with flexible licensing options that allows organizations to pay a one time license fee to install the software inside of their environment  or to purchase perpetual licenses and have those licenses hosted in our co location facility 
we find this flexibility to be an important differentiator to address the needs of customers that are ready to make an enterprise wide decision as well as customers that think their usage may grow throughout their organization 
this licensing structure also enables us to maintain a consistent revenue stream of smaller sized purchases while also winning larger enterprise wide deals that help substantially increase revenue growth 
second  as noted earlier  we provide a completely integrated web  audio  video and voice over ip conferencing solution with what we believe to be a rich feature set 
according to web conferencing analysts  as the industry moves beyond the boundaries imposed by the term web conferencing to more of a rich media communications environment  those vendors that are ahead of the curve in terms of features and functionality will be around for the long term survival 
vendors offering a me too solution are not expected to be active long term competitors and are expected to disappear in the form of consolidation  acquisitions  or all together exit the market because of shrinking profits 
third  we offer the highest level of data security commercially available 
we believe that we are the only web conferencing provider that offers a customer hosted solution with a purchase license option and true point to point security with our unique combination of advanced encryption standard aes and secure socket layer ssl 
all information within a session can be transmitted between meeting attendees securely without any reduction in performance 
this aspect of our software has been extremely attractive to government  military  and financial organizations as well as to the companies that supply to these entities 
we also believe that this solution combined with other aspects of our software enables us to be a more reliable solution than our web conferencing software competitors 
our customers report that they are able to get more people into web conferencing session regardless of whether they are connecting users from directly inside of a network or outside of a network 
importantly  the ilinc software also works in locked down environment and is very successful getting through firewalls 
fourth  our solution is suitable and scalable for enterprise wide deployment 
the ilinc suite contains four modes that address the most common needs for business collaboration within the enterprise 
we offer virtual classroom software with our learnlinc mode  presentation and sales demonstration capabilities with meetinglinc  customer support with supportlinc  and a mode for web casts and marketing events with conferencelinc 
each of these modes shares a common interface enabling users of one mode to easily understand any of our other modes 
this reduces the learning curve for web conferencing enterprise wide roll out and we believe increases adoption success 
all users can have access to all four modes of the suite 
this is an important differentiation because our competition typically charges separate licensing fees for the use of separate modes 
giving users access to the full suite supports the natural migration of web conferencing usage from department to department 
each of the modes has functionality built specifically for a particular type of activity 
the most comprehensive feature set is included in learnlinc  which we believe to be one the best virtual classroom training tools on the market 
learnlinc defeated every other major web conferencing provider at the only synchronous software shootout ever held at the online learning expo 
at this event  training professional selected learnlinc as the first place winner when judged on overall capabilities and ease of use 
industry analyst bersin and associated also recently noted learnlinc as the first virtual classroom technology ever developed and still a technology leader today in a may study 
fifth  we provide what we believe to be an exceptional total cost of ownership value 
our software and services are competitively priced  but unlike our competitors  a customer s installation of our product is a very short and non labor intensive process 
maintenance of our software also requires minimal attention from an it perspective 
most of our web conferencing software competitors require very complex and costly implementations 
we believe that all of these factors make our solution compelling to organizations that have already adopted the practice of web conferencing as a best practice as well as companies that are just starting to use web conferencing  but anticipate that their usage will grow quickly 
we recognize that in order to grow our market share we need to develop products that are easy to implement and that scale with our customer needs 
sales and marketing focus to leverage these advantages  our organization continually creates new marketing and sales campaigns that focus in four target markets 
o we sell to prospects that are using other web conferencing service providers that are ready to migrate to web conferencing software 
we find that these organizations appreciate the cost and feature advantages that our technology offers 
o we target organizations that have a natural fit for highly secure  web conferencing software such as government  military  and financial organizations as well as the companies that supply to these entities 
o we target organizations looking to deploy live  web based training 
our software was originally built for training and we have maintained a competitive technology advantage in this area 
o we continue to cross sell all of our products and services to our large database of existing customers 
results of operations as of march   we provide integrated web and audio conferencing software and services with what we believe to be a very robust feature set that includes integrated video and voice over ip 
the ilinc suite includes learnlinc which permits live instructor led training and education over the internet to remote students replicating the instructor led environment  meetinglinc which facilitates more effective and economical communication through online meetings using voice over ip technology to avoid the expense of travel and long distance charges  conferencelinc which delivers your message more consistently in a one to many format replicating professionally managed conferencing events  and supportlinc which gives customer service organizations the ability to provide remote  hands on support for products  systems  or software applications 
the ilinc suite is available in both a periodic license rental model and perpetual license purchase model 
since its beginnings in  learnlinc and meetinglinc have been installed and operational in corporate  government  and educational organizations in the united states and internationally 
our ilinc suite of products includes the ability to use integrated voice over ip and two way live video 
we have also completely integrated together audio conferencing services into the web conferencing products 
these services supplement the web product but can also be purchased separately 
on june   the company executed an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of and assume certain liabilities of glyphics communications  inc  a utah based private company 
the acquisition had a stated effective date of june  and was fully consummated on june  the purchase price totaled million depending upon contingencies in the purchase agreement that are based on a multiple of the glyphics estimated annual audited net audio conferencing business revenues 
the purchase price was paid with the assumption of approximately million in specific liabilities  with the balance paid using the company s common stock at the fixed price of per share  or an estimated million shares 
twenty percent of the consideration due is being held in escrow 
the consideration held in escrow is in the form of  shares of the company s common stock 
shares held in escrow will be available to the company to satisfy contingent claims and seller s indemnification obligations 
shares held in escrow also may be returned to the company in the event that audio conferencing revenues obtained by the company during the month period beginning june  do not exceed the audited revenues earned by glyphics during the calendar year ending december  due to the company assuming obligations of  greater than scheduled in the purchase agreement  the company believes that it has a claim of return against approximately  of the shares held in escrow 
individuals and entities participating in this transaction who are shareholders receiving the company s common stock have the right to demand registration of the common stock issued therefrom upon written notice  one year from the date of the transaction  to the company and also have piggyback registration rights should the company file a registration statement before the shares are otherwise registered 
the operations of the company involve many risks  which  even through a combination of experience  knowledge  and careful evaluation  may not be overcome 
these risks include the fact that the market for web conferencing products and services is in the early stages of development and may not grow to a sufficient size or at a sufficient rate to sustain the company s business 
the company also faces intense competition from other web conferencing and audio conferencing providers and may be unable to compete successfully 
many of the company s existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  and other resources and therefore may be able to more quickly respond to changing opportunities or customer requirements 
new competitors are also likely to enter this market in the future due to the lack of significant barrier to entry in the market share

we plan to expand where appropriate with external growth by acquisition  with those acquisitions including providers of audio conferencing as well as web conferencing products and services

a portion of the company s plans to address these issues includes further reductions in overhead or the negotiation of payables from acquisitions 
although we continue to pursue these plans  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining sufficient revenues from its web conferencing and audio conferencing products and services to provide adequate cash flows to sustain our operations

the senior notes bear interest at a rate of per annum and accrued interest was due and payable on a quarterly basis beginning july   with principal due at maturity on july  the senior notes are redeemable by the company at of the principal value at any time after july  the senior notes are unsecured obligations of the company but are senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the company 
on june   the company executed an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of and assume certain liabilities of glyphics communications  inc  a utah based private company 
the acquisition had a stated effective date of june  and was fully consummated on june  the purchase price totaled million depending upon contingencies in the purchase agreement that are based on a multiple of the glyphics estimated annual audited net audio conferencing business revenues 
the purchase price was paid with the assumption of approximately million in specific liabilities  with the balance paid using the company s common stock at the fixed price of per share  or an estimated million shares 
twenty percent of the consideration due is being held in escrow 
the consideration held in escrow is in the form of  shares of the company s common stock 
shares held in escrow will be available to the company to satisfy contingent claims and seller s indemnification obligations 
shares held in escrow also may be returned to the company in the event that audio conferencing revenues obtained by the company during the month period beginning june  do not exceed the audited revenues earned by glyphics during the calendar year ending december  due to the company assuming obligations of  greater than scheduled in the purchase agreement  the company believes that it has a claim of return against approximately  of the shares held in escrow 
individuals and entities participating in this transaction who are shareholders receiving the company s common stock have the right to demand registration of the common stock issued therefrom upon written notice  one year from the date of the transaction  to the company and also have piggyback registration rights should the company file a registration statement before the shares are otherwise registered 
contractual obligations the following schedule details all of the company s indebtedness and the required payments related to such obligations at march  in thousands due in due in years less than due in due in year four and due after total one year year two three five five years long term debt    capital lease obligations interest expense     operating lease obligations  base salary commitments under employment agreements  total contractual obligations       critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the more significant areas requiring use of estimates relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and notes receivable valuation reserves  realizability of intangible assets  realizability of deferred income tax assets  and the evaluation of contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of such estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are generally classified into three main categories license revenue  software and audio service revenue and maintenance and professional service revenue 
license revenue is generated from the sale of our ilinc suite of web conferencing software on a software purchase model basis and from the sale of our off the shelf courseware  primarily the online bridge mini mba program 
software and audio service revenue is generated from the sale of our ilinc suite of web conferencing software on an application service provider asp model basis  the sale of our ilinc suite software on a per minute basis  and includes all revenue from the provision of audio conferencing services  as well as  all service contracts that might include hosting and training services 
maintenance and professional service revenue is generated from the sale of maintenance contracts related to our ilinc suite of web conferencing software on a purchase model basis  when hosted by the customer  and from the sale of professional services that are associated with our custom content development services 
sales of software licenses because we offer the ilinc suite software in one of two forms  the first being a purchase model and the second being an asp or per minute model  we have separate revenue recognition policies applicable to each licensing model 
with each sale of our web conferencing products and services  we execute written contracts with our customers that govern the terms and conditions of each software license sale  hosting agreement  maintenance and support agreement  and other services arrangements 
we do not typically execute written agreements for the sale of audio conferencing services 
in connection with the company s sales of software licenses  whether on a purchase model basis or periodic license basis  the company adopted statement of position sop as issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
in accordance with sop  the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses if all of the following conditions are met first  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  second  the product has been delivered to the customer  third  the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and  fourth  collection of the fee is probable 
each of these factors  particularly the determination of whether a fee is fixed and determinable and the collectability of the resulting receivable  requires the application of the judgment and the estimates of management 
therefore  significant management judgment is utilized and estimates must be made in connection with the revenue we recognize in any accounting period 
we analyze various factors  including a review of the nature of the license or product sold  the terms of each specific transaction  the vendor specific objective evidence of the elements required by sop  any contingencies that may be present  our historical experience with like transactions or with like products  the creditworthiness of the customer  and other current market and economic conditions 
changes in our judgment based upon these factors and others could impact the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize  and ultimately the results of operations and our financial condition 
therefore  the recognition of revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
at the time of the sale of our software license on a purchase license basis  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction before recording immediate revenue recognition  assuming all other elements of revenue recognition are present 
billings to our customers are generally due within to days  with payment terms up to days available to certain credit worthy customers 
we believe that we will have sufficient history of collecting all amounts within these normal payment terms and to conclude that the fee is fixed or determinable at the time of the perpetual license sale 
under certain circumstances  we have offered payment terms greater than days and up to as much as months to certain customers  for sales involving our web conferencing perpetual license products where license revenue would normally be recognized upon delivery of the product 
however  we currently do not believe that we have sufficient history of selling the ilinc suite of products under perpetual license arrangements with extended payment terms exceeding days  and therefore will record revenue when the payments from the customer are due  rather than immediately upon delivery of the product and collection is probable  assuming all other elements of revenue recognition are present 
beginning in fiscal  we began offering payment terms of days and anticipate continuing using those day payment terms related to sales of our perpetual license products 
while we do not at this time believe that we have sufficient history of selling perpetual licenses with day payment terms to determine that such fees are fixed and determinable  we do expect to consider those day payment terms to be normal payment terms for certain well capitalized customers when we have such a history  and accordingly  at that time will include those sales in revenue when the perpetual license sale occurs again assuming all other aspects of revenue recognition are present 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than days not to be fixed or determinable and for arrangements involving the extended payment terms exceeding days  revenue recognition occurs when payments are due and collection is probable  assuming all other elements of revenue recognition are present 
in addition  in assessing whether collection is probable or not for a given transaction  and therefore whether we should recognize the revenue  we make estimates regarding the creditworthiness of the customer 
initial creditworthiness is assessed through internal credit check processes  such as credit applications or third party reporting agencies 
creditworthiness for transactions to existing customers primarily relies upon a review of their prior payment history 
we do not request collateral or other security from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of payment or other change in circumstance 
sales of concurrent licenses on an asp and per minute basis historically and on a continuing basis  a majority of our license revenue has been generated under the software purchase model basis  with revenue recognized based on a one time sale of a perpetual license 
in addition to that purchase model software sale  we also offer a more flexible concurrent connection seat license and a pay per minute usage based model 
under our asp model  a customer may subscribe to a certain number of concurrent connections or seats for a fixed period  often a year 
under this asp method  we recognize the revenue associated with these monthly  fixed fee subscription arrangements each month on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
other customers choose to avoid annual commitments and instead use our web conferencing and audio conferencing products and services based upon a per minute or usage based pricing model 
per minute customers may also include those customers on an asp model that incur overage fees for usage in excess of the permitted number of seats or minutes in excess of the minimum commitment 
the per minute fees that include overage fees are charged at the end of each month and recorded as revenue at the end of each month as the services are provided 
customers with contractually established minimum per minute fees are assessed the greater of the established minimum or the actual usage at the end of each month 
customers wishing to avoid monthly commitments may use the e commerce portion of our web site that permits the use of our web conferencing services on a pay per use basis  with no monthly minimum  purchasing the services and paying for those services online by credit card 
sales of maintenance  hosting  and other related services the company offers with each sale of its software products a software maintenance  upgrade  and support arrangement 
these contracts may be elements in a multiple element arrangement or may be sold in a stand alone basis 
revenues from maintenance and support services are recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the term that the maintenance service is provided 
maintenance contracts typically provide for month terms with maintenance contracts available up to months 
the company typically charges to for a month contract with discounts available for longer term agreements 
the company also typically charges to for hosting of purchase model software sales for customers who do not wish to install and host the ilinc suite on their own premises or that of a co location facility 
charges for hosting are likewise spread ratably over the term of the hosting agreement  with the typical hosting agreement having a term of months  with renewal on an annual basis 
revenues from consulting  training  and education services are recognized either as the services are performed  ratably over a subscription period  or upon completing a project milestone if defined in the agreement 
these consulting  training  and education services  are not considered essential to the functionality of our products as these services do not alter the product capabilities  do not require specialized skills  and are often performed by the customer or our var s customers without access to those services 
implementation  consulting  training  translation  and other event type services may also be sold in conjunction with the sale of our software products 
those services are generally recognized as the services are performed or earlier when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
although the company may provide implementation  training  and consulting services on a time and materials basis  a significant portion of these services have been provided on a fixed fee basis 
should the sale of our software involve an arrangement with multiple elements for example  the sale of a software license along with the sale of maintenance and support to be delivered over the contract period  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
we defer revenue from the arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the remaining amount at the time of the delivery of the product or when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based upon separate sales of renewals of maintenance contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other customers 
thus  these types of arrangements require us to make judgments about the fair value of undelivered arrangements 
sales of custom content development services a component of our maintenance and professional services revenue is derived from custom content development services 
the sale of custom content development services often involves the execution of a master service agreement and corresponding work orders describing the deliverable due  the costs involved  the project milestones  and the payments required 
for contracts and revenues related exclusively to custom content development services  the company recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on custom content service contracts using the percentage of completion method 
this method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs as each job progresses throughout the relevant contract period 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a custom content service contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the custom content service contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
customers sometimes request modifications to projects in progress which may result in significant revisions to cost estimates and profit recognition  and the company may not be successful in negotiating additional payments related to the changes in scope of requested services 
should this arise  the provision for any estimated losses on uncompleted custom content service contracts are made in the period in which such losses become evident 
there were no such losses at march  for any custom content development services 
for arrangements requiring customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the earlier of the end of the acceptance period or until written notice of acceptance is received from the customer 
sales by var s and agents the company has engaged organizations within the united states of america and in other countries that market and sell its products and services through their sales distribution channels that are value added resellers var s 
the var s primarily sell  on a non exclusive basis  our ilinc suite of web conferencing products and predominately sell purchase model perpetual licenses for installation and hosting by the var s customer 
the company s var contracts have terms of one to two years and are automatically renewed for an additional like term unless either party terminates the agreement for breach or other financial reasons 
each var purchases the product from the company and resells the product to its customers 
under those var agreements  the company records only the amount paid by the var as revenue and recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company also engages organizations that act as mere agents or distributors of its products agents  without title passing to the agent and with the agent only receiving a commission on the consummation of the sale to our customer 
the company records revenue on sales by agents on a gross basis before commissions due to the agent and only when all revenue recognition criteria are met as would be with a sale by the company directly to a customer not involving an agent 
sales reserves the sales reserve is an estimate for losses on receivables resulting from customer credits  cancellations and terminations and is recorded  if at all  as a reduction in revenue at the time of the sale 
increases to sales reserve are charged to revenue  reducing the revenue otherwise reportable 
the sales reserve estimate is based on an analysis of the historical rate of credits  cancellations  and terminations 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the rate of future credits  cancellations  and terminations being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of actual credits  cancellations  and terminations is different than the historical rate  revenue would be different from what was reported 
as of march   we believe that an accrual for sales reserves was appropriate  and will continue to assess the adequacy of the sales reserve account balance on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for losses on accounts receivable due to customer credit risk 
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to general and administrative expense as bad debt expense 
losses on accounts receivable due to financial distress or failure of the customer are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance estimate is based on an analysis of the historical rate of credit losses 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the future rate of credit losses being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of future credit losses is greater than the historical rate  then the allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to provide for actual credit losses 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is  as of march    and is based on our historical collection experience 
any adjustments to these accounts are reflected in the income statement for the current period  as an adjustment to revenue in the case of the sales reserve and as a general and administrative expense in the case of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
software development costs the company accounts for software development costs in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  whereby costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs are capitalized 
technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model 
costs of maintenance and customer support are charged to expense when related revenue is recognized or when those costs are incurred  whichever occurs first 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant to date  and all software development costs have been charged to research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
intangible assets on april   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and as a result  the company s goodwill is no longer amortized 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
upon initial application of sfas no 
 the company determined there was no impairment of goodwill 
the company has established the date of march on which to value its goodwill 
the company has made acquisitions of companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus and has recorded goodwill and other intangible assets associated with its acquisitions 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying acquired operations could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company  based on a third party full scope valuation with a valuation date of march   indicated that impairment of that goodwill and intangible assets was not required 
based upon that third party valuation and further analysis performed  the company s management believes no such impairment exists at march  debt issuance costs are amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the related debt obligations 
other intangibles primarily consist of the quisic and learnlinc purchase consideration that was allocated to purchased software and customer relationship intangibles 
such other intangibles are amortized over their expected benefit period of to months 
income taxes the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred taxes are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted marginal tax rates currently in effect when the differences reverse 
the company has recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its net deferred tax assets because it has concluded that it is more likely than not that it will not be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such a determination was made 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to sfas no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method on accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the company has adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and accordingly the implementation of sfas no 
did not have a material affect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under this new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and to recognize the expense over the service period 
sfas r will be effective for periods beginning after june  and allows for several alternative transition methods 
the company expects to adopt sfas r in its second quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis  which will require recognition of compensation expense for all stock option or other equity based awards that vest or become exercisable after the effective date 
we are currently assessing the impact of this proposed statement on our share based compensation programs  however  we expect that the requirement to expense stock options and other equity interests that have been or will be granted to employees will increase our operating expenses and result in lower earnings per share 
guarantees and indemnifications in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fin the following is a summary of the company s agreements that the company has determined are within the scope of fin no 
the company provides a day warranty for certain of its products 
historically  the company s performance under the warranty has been minimal  and as such  no warranty accrual has been provided for in the company s consolidated financial statements 
under its bylaws  the company has agreed to indemnify its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officers or directors serving in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  the company has a director and officer liability insurance policy that limits its exposure and enables it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of its insurance policy coverage  the company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of march  the company enters into indemnification provisions under i its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business  typically with business partners  contractors  and customers  landlords and ii its agreements with investors 
under these provisions the company generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the company s activities or  in some cases  as a result of the indemnified party s activities under the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
the company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  the company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of march  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under this new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and to recognize the expense over the service period 
sfas r will be effective for periods beginning after june  and allows for several alternative transition methods 
the company expects to adopt sfas r in its second quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis  which will require recognition of compensation expense for all stock option or other equity based awards that vest or become exercisable after the effective date 
we are currently assessing the impact of this proposed statement on our share based compensation programs  however  we expect that the requirement to expense stock options and other equity interests that have been or will be granted to employees will increase our operating expenses and result in lower earnings per share 
additional risk factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business 
we have a limited operating history in the web conferencing and audio conferencing business 
while the organizations that we have acquired have been engaged in their respective business for over five years  we only recently acquired those assets and have undertaken to integrate their assets into our operations at varying levels 
since the acquisition of these businesses  we have made significant changes to our product mix and service mix  our growth strategies  our sales and marketing plans  and other operational matters 
as a result  it may be difficult to evaluate an investment in our company 
given our recent investment in technology  we cannot be certain that our business model and future operating performance will yield the results that we intend 
in addition  the competitive and rapidly changing nature of the web conferencing and audio conferencing markets makes it difficult for us to predict future results 
our business strategy may be unsuccessful and we may be unable to address the risks we face 
we face risks inherent in internet related businesses and may be unsuccessful in addressing these risks 
we face risks frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as web conferencing and audio conferencing 
we may fail to adequately address these risks and  as a consequence  our business may suffer 
to address these risks among others  we must successfully introduce and attract new customers to our products and services  successfully implement our sales and marketing strategy to generate sufficient sales and revenues to achieve or sustain operations  foster existing relationships with our existing customers to provide for continued or recurring business and cash flow  and  successfully address and establish new products and technologies as new markets develop 
we may not be able to sufficiently access  address  and overcome risks inherent in our business strategy 
our quarterly operating results are uncertain and may fluctuate significantly 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter and are likely to continue to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which we cannot control 
factors that may adversely affect our quarterly operating results include the size and timing of product orders  the mix of revenue from custom services and software products  the market acceptance of our products and services  our ability to develop and market new products in a timely manner and the market acceptance of these new products  the timing of revenues and expenses relating to our product sales  and  the timing of revenue recognition 
expense levels are based  in part  on expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
to the extent we are unable to predict future revenue accurately  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
we have significant operating losses  have limited financial resources  and may not become profitable 
we have incurred substantial operating losses and have limited financial resources at our disposal 
we have long term obligations that we will not be able to satisfy without additional debt and or equity capital and or ultimately generating profits and cash flows from our web conferencing and audio conferencing operations 
if we are unable to achieve profitability in the near future  we will face increasing demands for capital and liquidity 
we may not be successful in raising additional debt or equity capital and may not become profitable in the short term or not at all 
as a result  we may not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy our obligations as they come due in the short term 
our auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that we will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
we have a significant working capital deficiency  and have historically suffered substantial recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations 
these factors  among others  have caused our auditors to conclude in their report that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
our plans with regard to these factors include continued development  marketing  and licensing of our web conferencing and audio conferencing products and services through both internal growth and acquisition and the obtainment of additional capital 
although we continue to pursue these plans  there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient revenues from our products and services to provide adequate cash flows to sustain operations 
our continuation is dependent on our ability to raise additional equity or debt capital  to increase our web conferencing and audio conferencing revenues  to generate positive cash flows from operations and to achieve profitability 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
listing qualifications may not be met 
the american stock exchange s continued listing standards require that the company maintain stockholder s equity of at least million if the company has losses from continuing operations and or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years 
the company has sustained losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years and therefore must maintain at stockholder s equity of at least million 
as of the date of this report  the company did not have at least million in stockholder s equity 
if now or in the future  the company fails to maintain a sufficient level of stockholder s equity in compliance with those and other listing standards of the american stock exchange then the company would be required to submit a plan to the american stock exchange describing how it intended to regain compliance with the requirements 
dilution to existing stockholders is likely to occur upon issuance of shares we have reserved for future issuance 
on march    shares of our common stock were issued  of which  were held in treasury  and  additional shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance 
the issuance of these additional shares will reduce the percentage ownership of existing stockholders in the company 
the existence of these reserved shares coupled with other factors  such as the relatively small public float  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and our ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities 
the loss of the services of our senior executives and key personnel would likely cause our business to suffer 
our success depends to a significant degree on the performance of our senior management team 
the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 
we do not maintain key person life insurance for any officers or key employees other than on the life of james m 
powers  jr  our chairman  president and ceo  with that policy providing a death benefit to the company of million 
our success also depends on the ability to attract  integrate  motivate and retain additional highly skilled technical  sales and marketing  and professional services personnel 
to the extent we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of additional skilled personnel  our business will suffer 
our intellectual property may become subject to legal challenges  unauthorized use or infringement  any of which could diminish the value of our products and services 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  the value of these rights  and consequently  the value of our products and services to our customers  could diminish substantially 
it may be possible for third parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or trade secrets without our authorization  and it may also be possible for third parties to independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property 
currently  we do not have patent protection in place related to our products and services 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
while we have not received any notice of any claim of infringement of any of our intellectual property  from time to time we may receive notice of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
such claims could result in costly litigation and could divert management and technical resources 
these types of claims could also delay product shipment or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which agreements  if required  may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
competition in the web conferencing and audio conferencing services market is intense and we may be unable to compete successfully  particularly as a result of recent announcements from large software companies 
the markets for web conferencing and audio conferencing products and services are relatively new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
competition in our market will continue to intensify and may force us to reduce our prices  or cause us to experience reduced sales and margins  loss of market share and reduced acceptance of our services 
many of our competitors have larger and more established customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  broader service offerings  more employees and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations  and distribution resources than we do 
we expect that we will face new competition as others enter our market to develop web conferencing and audio conferencing services 
these current and future competitors may also offer or develop products or services that perform better than ours 
in addition  acquisitions or strategic partnerships involving our current and potential competitors could harm us in a number of ways 
future regulations could be enacted that either directly restrict our business or indirectly impact our business by limiting the growth of internet based business and services 
as commercial use of the internet increases  federal  state  and foreign agencies could enact laws or adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy  content  and taxation of products and services 
if enacted  such laws or regulations could limit the market for our products and services 
although they might not apply to our business directly  we expect that laws or rules regulating personal and consumer information could indirectly affect our business 
it is possible that such legislation or regulation could expose us to liability which could limit the growth of our web conferencing and audio conferencing products and services 
such legislation or regulation could dampen the growth in overall web conferencing usage and decrease the internet s acceptance as a medium of communications and commerce 
we depend largely on one time sales to grow revenues which make our revenues difficult to predict 
while audio conferencing provides a more recurring revenue base  a high percentage of our revenue is attributable to one time purchases by our customers rather than long term recurring conferencing asp type contracts 
as a result  our inability to continue to obtain new agreements and sales may result in lower than expected revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to achieve or sustain operations or profitability on a consistent basis  which could also cause our stock price to decline 
further  because we face competition from larger better capitalized companies  we could face increased downward pricing pressure that could cause a decrease in our gross margins 
additionally  our sales cycle varies depending on the size and type of customer considering a purchase 
potential customers frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision makers within their company and may evaluate competing products and services before deciding to use our services 
our sales cycle  which can range from several weeks to several months or more  combined with the license purchase model makes it difficult to predict future quarterly revenues 
our operating results may suffer if we fail to develop and foster our value added reseller or distribution relationships 
we have an existing channel and distribution network that provides growing revenues and contributes to our high margin software sales 
these distribution partners are not obligated to distribute our services at any particular minimum level 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict the amount of revenue we will derive from our distribution partners in the future 
the inability of our distribution partners to sell our products to their customers and increase their distribution of our products could result in significant reductions in our revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
sales in foreign jurisdictions by us and our international distributor network may cause costs that are not anticipated 
we continue to expand internationally through our value added reseller network and oem partners 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete effectively in international markets 
we face certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  such as o our inability to establish and maintain effective distribution channels and partners  o the varying technology standards from country to country  o our inability to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or the code to our software  o our inexperience with inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions  o language and cultural differences  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  o our inability to effectively collect accounts receivable  or o our inability to manage sales and other taxes imposed by foreign jurisdictions 
the growth of our business substantially depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new services and features in a timely manner 
we acquired our web conferencing software and business in november of and we acquired our audio conferencing business in june of with our focus on those products and services  our growth depends on our ability to continue to develop new features  products  and services around that software and product line 
we may not successfully identify  develop  and market new products and features in a timely and cost effective manner 
if we fail to develop and maintain market acceptance of our existing and new products to offset our continuing development costs  then our net losses will increase and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
if we fail to offer competitive pricing  we may not be able to attract and retain customers 
because the web conferencing market is relatively new and still evolving  the prices for these services are subject to rapid and frequent changes 
in many cases  businesses provide their services at significantly reduced rates  for free or on a trial basis in order to win customers 
due to competitive factors and the rapidly changing marketplace  we may be required to significantly reduce our pricing structure  which would negatively affect our revenue  margins and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
we have an existing channel and distribution network that provides growing revenues and contributes to our high margin software sales 
these distribution partners are not obligated to distribute our services at any particular minimum level 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict the amount of revenue we will derive from our distribution partners in the future 
the inability of our distribution partners to sell our products to their customers and increase their distribution of our products could result in significant reductions in our revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
if we are unable to complete our assessment as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley of  the securities and exchange commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include in their annual reports on form k a report of management on their company s internal control over financial reporting  including management s assessment of the effectiveness of their company s internal control over financial reporting as of the company s fiscal year end 
in addition  the accounting firm auditing a public company s financial statements must also attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as well as the operating effectiveness of the company s internal controls 
there is a risk that we may not comply with all of its requirements 
if we do not timely complete our assessment or if our internal controls are not designed or operating effectively as required by section  our accounting firm may either disclaim an opinion as it is related to management s assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls or may issue a qualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal controls 
if our accounting firm disclaims its opinion or qualifies its opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls  then investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we may acquire other businesses that could negatively affect our operations and financial results and dilute existing stockholders 
we may pursue additional business relationships through acquisition which may not be successful 
we may have to devote substantial time and resources in order to complete acquisitions and we therefore may not realize the benefits of those acquisitions 
further  these potential acquisitions entail risks  uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business 
for example  we may not be able to successfully integrate a company s operations  technologies  products and services  information systems  and personnel into our business 
these risks could harm our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 
our current stock compensation expense negatively impacts our earnings  and when we are required to report the fair value of employee stock options as an expense in conjunction with the new accounting standards  our earnings will be adversely affected  which may cause our stock price to decline 
under our current accounting practice  stock compensation expense is recorded on the date of the grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price 
beginning with the fiscal quarter ended september   we will be required to report all employee stock options as an expense based on a change in the accounting standards and our earnings will be negatively impacted  which may cause our stock price to decline and increase our anticipated net losses 
we are exposed to risks relating to the effectiveness of our internal controls on august   the company s independent registered public accountants orally notified the company s audit committee that they had identified significant deficiencies regarding the company s internal controls 
the deficiencies noted were lack of sufficient management oversight over and the proper segregation of duties of the accounting department 
on november   the company s independent registered public accountants orally notified the company s audit committee that they had identified a material weakness regarding the company s internal controls 
the material weakness noted was the lack of sufficient control over the sales order and revenue recognition process 
following the august  notification regarding significant deficiencies in accounting controls related to management oversight and proper segregation of duties in the accounting department  the company took the following actions o the company hired a new cfo and a new controller replacing the interim cfo and replacing the vp of finance  o the company hired a new a p clerk and added a dedicated a r clerk to supplement the accounting staff  further segregating functions to the extent possible in a small organization  o the company restructured the roles of the new controller in combination with a change in the reporting procedures for the a p clerk and a r clerk to strengthen the reporting structures and internal control procedures  o the company implemented new sign off procedures for sales agreements to require multiple party sign off from both the sales and finance departments  and o the company added to its crm software the ability to gain access to view sales contracts and recorded purchase information in that system as well as the accounting systems 
in response to the november  notification regarding the material weakness regarding the company s internal controls  the company implemented steps to prevent failure to communicate changes in standard forms of customer contracts in the future and strengthen the company s internal controls related to contract management and its impact on revenue recognition 
the company has put procedures into place to prevent modification of its standard form of software license agreements without due and proper notice to all parties  including the company s accounting group 
those steps to correct and prevent this in the future include o new controls over the modification of electronic contracts adding limited password protection  o the electronic receipt of contracts from customers directly to both the sales and accounting groups simultaneously  o the numbering of contracts and order forms to provide a stronger audit trail  o the electronic storage of all customers contracts providing real time access  o the notification of the accounting department by the sales or legal departments should modification occur  and o remedial training of the sales group on the impact of changes to the software license agreement 
o a further segregation of duties was also implemented to better control contract workflow as follows o a supervisor from the sales team must approve all sales orders before they are accepted by the sales department  and a supervisor from the accounting group must approve all orders that exceed  in amount before they are accepted as a valid sale of the company  o an order processing clerk verifies that the appropriate customer and company authorizations have been obtained  o the approved sales order is transmitted to the customer service department for order fulfillment  o notification of fulfillment of the order is sent to both the sales and accounting departments  and o before revenue is recognized on any sales order  the controller verifies that the sales order was properly approved by the customer and the company  verifies that changes  if any  to the standard license agreement have been properly documented in writing and in the customer s electronic file and thereafter records revenue based upon the approved and verified documentation 
the company believes that the steps it has taken adequately address the significant deficiencies and material weaknesses identified by the company s independent registered public accountants 
however  we may experience control deficiencies or weaknesses in the future  which could adversely impact the accuracy and timeliness of our future financial reporting and reports and filings we make with the sec 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have not traded or otherwise bought and sold derivatives nor do we expect to in the future 
we also do not invest in market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
sales are predominately made in us dollars  however  we have sold products that were payable in euros and canadian dollars 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products and services less competitive in foreign markets 
the primary objective of the company s investment activity is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of money market funds 
as of march   the carrying value of our outstanding convertible redeemable subordinated notes and unsecured senior notes was approximately million at fixed interest rates of to 
in certain circumstances  we may redeem this long term debt 
our other components of indebtedness bear interest rates of to 
increases in interest rates could increase the interest expense associated with future borrowings  if any 
we do not hedge against interest rate increases
