item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview kimball international  inc provides a variety of products from its two business segments the furniture and cabinets segment and the electronic contract assemblies segment 
the furniture and cabinets segment provides furniture for the office and hospitality industries  all sold under the company s family of brand names 
the furniture and cabinets segment also provides engineering and manufacturing services which utilize common production and support capabilities on a contract basis to customers in the residential furniture and cabinets  office furniture and retail infrastructure industries  as well as forest products 
the electronic contract assemblies segment provides engineering and manufacturing services which utilize common production and support capabilities to a variety of industries globally 
management currently considers the following events  trends and uncertainties to be most important to understanding its financial condition and operating performance competitive pricing continues to put pressure on the company s operating margins in both segments  especially for suppliers of electronic contract assemblies to customers in the transportation industry 
the nature of the contract electronics manufacturing industry is such that the start up of new programs to replace departing customers or expiring programs occurs frequently and the new programs often carry lower margins 
the success of the electronic contract assemblies segment is dependent on the successful replacement of such customers or programs 
such changes usually occur gradually over time as old programs phase out of production while newer programs ramp up 
increased costs of several key components used in furniture and cabinets segment products  primarily commodities such as steel and wood composite sheet stock  are a continuous challenge 
in turn  the company has increased prices of certain end products which have been impacted by the commodity cost increases 
results continue to be hindered by manufacturing inefficiencies at select contract furniture and cabinets operations 
the company is continually assessing excess capacity and developing plans to better utilize manufacturing operations 
as end markets dictate  certain operations with excess capacity have been exited with the remaining business transferred to other business units 
the company exited the branded residential furniture market and a veneer slicing operation during fiscal year as both were operating at a loss 
management did not anticipate that either of these businesses would generate positive earnings in the foreseeable future 
the company will focus its resources in the future on its core businesses 
the company s net cash position from an aggregate of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  less short term borrowings totaled million at june  and the company continued to generate positive operating cash flow to fund operations 
the preceding statements are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  a significant change in economic conditions  loss of key customers or suppliers  or similar unforeseen events

the consolidation is expected to be complete by december during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company s board of directors approved a restructuring plan comprised of incremental cost scaling actions to more closely align the company s operating capacities and capabilities with reduced demand levels related to the prolonged nature of the global economic slowdown in many of the company s markets and the resulting continuation of underutilized manufacturing capacity within both of the company s segments 
the company has successfully executed the restructuring activities and the final restructuring expenses pursuant to this plan were recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year in june  the company s board of directors approved a plan to restructure certain operations to more closely align the company s capabilities and capacities with changing market requirements and economic conditions as well as position the company with a more competitive cost structure vital for overall long term success

at june  and june  the reserve for returns and allowances was million and million  respectively

income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
