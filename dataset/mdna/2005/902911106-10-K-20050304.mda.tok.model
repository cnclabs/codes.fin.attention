the company carries significant amounts of leaf tobacco along with bulk and bottled wine inventories as a result of the aging process required for the production of moist smokeless tobacco products and wine  respectively 
the increases in inventories over the past several years related primarily to in process and finished goods wine inventory resulting from factors in the marketplace  including an oversupply of grapes and cheaper imported wines 
as indicated in critical accounting policies and estimates  management reviews these inventories and has determined that they are saleable and appropriately carried at the lower of cost or market 
total expenditures for leaf tobacco over the last three years were million 
total costs of grapes harvested and purchased and purchases of bulk wine were million in and million over the last three years 
investing activities the increase in net cash used in investing activities was due to higher purchases of property  plant and equipment compared to over the last three years  capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment have averaged approximately million per year

capital expenditures for equipment in the smokeless tobacco segment over the past three years were primarily related to assuring manufacturing capabilities  new product innovations and product line extension capabilities 
wine segment capital expenditures during that period were primarily for increased capacity and expansion 
financing activities the company had net cash used in financing activities of million in compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in cash dividends paid in were higher than those in due to a percent increase in the dividend rate approved by the board of directors  partially offset by lower common shares outstanding 
although consistent through the first three quarters of and  comparatively  payments for the repurchase of company common stock in were higher than those made in based on management s decision to increase repurchases in the fourth quarter of proceeds from the issuance of common stock were higher than those received in primarily as a result of an increase in the number of stock options exercised and the higher average exercise price of such options exercised during the amount of net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the company s utilization of billion of funds held in restricted deposits  used to substantially pay the aforementioned antitrust judgment  and million in proceeds from the issuance of stock  partially offset by dividend payments of million and payments for the repurchase of company common stock of million

this new credit facility was executed primarily to support commercial paper borrowings 
the company had no direct borrowings under the new credit facility or commercial paper borrowings at december  fees of approximately million associated with the establishment of the new credit facility have been capitalized

in july  amounts outstanding under this loan facility were repaid 
the company s working capital decreased to million at december  as compared to million at december  the working capital decrease in was mainly attributable to the reclassification of the million current portion of long term debt and decreased deferred income tax assets  offset by increased cash and cash equivalents in and the decrease in the liabilities associated with the antitrust litigation

purchase commitments under contracts to purchase grapes for periods beyond one year are subject to variability resulting from potential changes in market price indices 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses recognized and incurred during the reporting period then ended 
in addition  estimates affect the determination of contingent assets and liabilities and their related disclosure 
the company bases its estimates on a number of factors  including historical information and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates in the event there are changes in related conditions or assumptions 
the development and selection of the disclosed estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the following accounting policies are deemed to be critical  as they require accounting estimates to be made based upon matters that are highly uncertain at the time such estimates are made 
the company carries significant amounts of leaf tobacco as well as bulk and bottled wine as a result of the aging process required in the production of its moist smokeless tobacco and wine products  respectively 
the carrying value of these inventories includes management s assessment of their estimated net realizable values 
management reviews these inventories to make judgments for potential write downs for slow moving  unsaleable or obsolete inventories  to reflect such inventories at the lower of cost or market 
factors considered in management s assessment include  but are not limited to  evaluation of cost trends  changes in customer demands  product pricing  physical deterioration and overall product quality 
amounts recognized in the financial statements for the company s noncontributory defined benefit pension plans are determined using actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including those for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used in calculating the applicable benefit obligation 
the company evaluates these assumptions on an annual basis and considers adjustments to the applicable long term factors based upon current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
changes in the related pension expense may occur in the future as a result of changes in these assumptions 
pension expense was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on average  over the past three years  approximately percent of pension expense was reflected in selling  advertising and administrative expenses  while the remainder was included in cost of products sold 
the decrease in pension expense for was primarily a result of increased returns on a higher asset base  due to contributions made in the prior year  partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate from percent to percent and a decrease in expected return on plan assets from percent to percent 
the company believes the long term rate of return is reasonable based upon the plans asset composition and information available at the time  along with consideration of historical trends 
the company used a discount rate of percent to calculate 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis continued its pension liabilities at december  this rate approximates the rate at which current pension liabilities could effectively be settled 
at december   unrecognized actuarial losses  associated with pension plan asset performance  were approximately million 
these losses will be amortized over the applicable remaining service period which is approximately years 
the company did not contribute to its qualified pension plans in the impact of a lower discount rate  partially offset by lower actuarial losses is expected to result in higher pension expense for the following provides a sensitivity analysis  which demonstrates the effects that adverse changes in actuarial assumptions would have on pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense by approximately million  while the same basis point decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase of approximately million 
the company maintains a number of other postretirement welfare benefit plans which provide certain medical and life insurance benefits to substantially all full time employees who have completed specified age and service requirements upon retirement 
amounts recognized in the financial statements in connection with these other postretirement benefit plans are determined utilizing actuarial valuations 
the key assumptions inherent in these valuations include health care cost trend rates and the discount rate used in calculating the applicable postretirement benefit obligation  each of which are evaluated by the company on an annual basis 
future changes in the related postretirement benefit expense may be impacted by changes in these assumptions 
the company used a discount rate of percent to calculate its postretirement benefit obligation at december   which approximates the rate at which current postretirement benefit liabilities could effectively be settled 
the health care cost trend increase used in calculating the postretirement benefit obligation at december  is assumed to be percent in and is expected to decrease gradually to percent by and remain level thereafter 
a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the impact that a basis point increase or decrease in these rates would have on both the postretirement benefit obligation and the related expense is disclosed in the employee benefit and compensation plans note to the consolidated financial statements 
expense related to these plans was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s primary business  moist smokeless tobacco  sells products with freshness dates 
it is the company s policy to accept sales returns from its customers for products that have exceeded such dates 
the company s assumptions regarding sales return accruals are based on historical experience  current sales trends and other factors  and there has not been a significant fluctuation between assumptions and actual return activity on a historical basis 
actual sales returns represented approximately percent  percent and percent of annual moist smokeless tobacco can sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
however  significant changes in moist smokeless tobacco can sales  promotional activities  new product introductions  product quality issues and competition could affect sales returns in the future 
the company is subject to various threatened and pending litigation claims and discloses those matters in which the probability of an adverse outcome is other than remote  in the notes to its consolidated financial statements 
the assessment of probability with regards to the outcome of litigation matters is made with the consultation of external counsel 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of the legal actions  proceedings or claims could ultimately be decided against the company 
any unfavorable outcome of such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
see the contingencies note to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the company s assessment related to pending litigation matters 
the company s income tax provision takes into consideration pretax income  statutory tax rates and the company s tax profile in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities reflect its best estimate of the future tax benefit and costs it expects to realize when such amounts are included in its tax returns 
quantitative and probability analysis  which incorporates management s judgment  is required in determining the company s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
notwithstanding the fact that all of the company s tax filing positions are supported by the requisite tax and legal authority  accruals are established in accordance with sfas no 
 contingencies  when the company believes that these positions are likely to be subject to challenge by a tax authority 
the internal revenue service and other tax authorities audit the company s income tax returns on a continuous basis 
depending on the tax jurisdiction  a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the 
table of contents k company has established an accrual is audited and ultimately resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the timing of tax audits and their final outcome  the company believes that its accruals reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
however  the final resolution of any such tax audits could result in either a reduction in the company s accruals or an increase in its income tax provision  both of which could have a significant impact on the results of operations in any given period 
the company continually and regularly evaluates  assesses and adjusts these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  which could cause the effective tax rate to fluctuate from period to period 
the company s management believes that no one single item that includes an assumption or estimate made by management will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  with the exception of litigation matters  if actual results are different from that assumption or estimate 
the company exercises judgment when evaluating the use of assumptions and estimates  which may include the use of specialists and quantitative and qualitative analysis 
management believes that all assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of these financial statements are reasonable based on information currently available 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking information the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking information made on behalf of the company 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts  which address activities or actions that the company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future  and growth of the company s operations and other such matters are forward looking statements 
to take advantage of the safe harbor provided by the act  the company is identifying certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by the company 
any one  or a combination  of these factors could materially affect the results of the company s operations 
these factors include competitive pressures  changes in consumer preferences  wholesaler ordering patterns  consumer acceptance of new product introductions and other marketing initiatives  uncertainties associated with ongoing and future litigation  legal and regulatory initiatives including those described under items and of the company s annual report on form k  in current reports on form k and in quarterly reports on form q  and conditions in the capital markets 
forward looking statements made by the company are based on knowledge of its business and the environment in which it operates  but because of the factors listed above  as well as other factors beyond the control of the company  actual results may differ from those in the forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements speak only as to the date when they are made 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis continued item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk  primarily in the form of interest rate risk 
the company routinely monitors this risk  and has instituted policies and procedures to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on its net earnings and cash flows 
to manage borrowing costs  the company uses fixed rate debt and derivative instruments  primarily interest rate swaps and treasury locks 
all derivative contracts are for non trading purposes  and are entered into with major reputable financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing counterparty risk 
at december  and  respectively  the company had billion in fixed rate senior notes and million in floating rate senior notes outstanding 
the fixed rate senior notes outstanding at december  and were comprised of long term notes of million with an interest rate of percent and million at percent  and notes of million at percent designated as short term as of december  on the consolidated statement of financial position 
in order to hedge the interest rate risk on the million floating rate senior notes  the company entered into an interest rate swap to pay a fixed rate of interest percent and receive a floating rate of interest on the notional amount of million 
this swap fixes the interest rate on the million in long term floating rate senior notes at percent 
the following provides a sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk and the effects of hypothetical sudden changes in the applicable market conditions on the succeeding year s earnings  based upon year end positions 
computations of the potential effects of the hypothetical market changes are based upon various assumptions  involving interest rate levels and other variables 
the fair values of the company s fixed rate senior notes payable are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
based upon an immediate basis point increase in the applicable interest rate at december   the fair value of the company s fixed rate senior notes would decrease by approximately million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in that rate would increase the fair value of these notes by million 
these hypothetical changes and assumptions may be different from what actually takes place in the future  and the computations do not take into account management s possible actions if such changes actually occurred over time 
considering these limitations  actual effects on future earnings could differ from those calculated above 
taking into account the company s floating rate senior notes payable and interest rate swap outstanding at december   each basis point increase or decrease in the applicable market rates of interest  with all other variables held constant  would not have any effect on interest expense 
this is due to the full correlation of the terms of the notes with those of the swap  which results in interest rates on all debt outstanding being fixed at december  in addition  from time to time  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows associated with foreign currency payments 
such payments are primarily made in connection with purchases of barrels for the company s wine operations 
there were no such contracts outstanding at december  or the company routinely invests portions of its cash in short term instruments 
it is the company s policy to ensure that these instruments are comprised of only investment grade securities as determined by a third party rating agency which mature in three months or less 
these factors  along with continual monitoring of the credit status of the investee companies and securities  reduce the company s exposure to investment risk associated with these securities 
at december   the company had approximately million invested in short term instruments
