item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview privatebancorp was organized as a delaware corporation in to serve as the holding company for a chicago based de novo start up bank 
our flagship downtown chicago location opened in we expanded to wilmette in north suburban cook county in and the oak brook facility in west suburban dupage county was established in we established the st 
charles office in january  in connection with our purchase of towne square financial corporation a company which was in the process of forming a de novo  or start up bank on august  on february   we consummated our acquisition of johnson bank illinois adding two additional locations in lake forest and winnetka  illinois 
during the second quarter  we received regulatory approval to create a new banking subsidiary and on june   privatebancorp capitalized the privatebank st 
louis 
in may  the privatebank chicago opened a second branch in the fox valley area in geneva  illinois 
in december  the privatebank chicago acquired an controlling interest in lodestar investment counsel llc  a chicago based investment adviser with million of assets under management at december  on june   the company formed a new subsidiary  the privatebank mortgage company  as a result of the acquisition of corley financial corporation  a chicago based mortgage banking firm 
on july   the company opened a new chicago banking office in the historic palmolive building at the corner of north michigan avenue and walton place in chicago s affluent gold coast neighborhood 
the company plans to open a new banking office in wisconsin to operate as the privatebank at n 
water street in downtown milwaukee in the third quarter of the privatebank wisconsin will commence operations in a temporary location in march we completed our initial public offering in june of since year end to december   we have grown our asset base at a compound annual rate of to billion 
during the same period  loans have grown at a compound annual rate of to billion  deposits at a compound annual rate of to billion and core deposits at a compound annual rate of to billion 
wealth management assets under management grew at a compound annual rate of to billion 
diluted earnings per share eps have grown at a compound annual rate of to split adjusted since year end for financial information regarding our four separate lines of business  the privatebank chicago  the privatebank st 
louis  wealth management services and holding company activities  see operating segments results beginning on page and note operating segments to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included on page f the profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of interest earning assets as compared to the amounts and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio  management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  loss experience  as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of net security gains and wealth management fee income  and to a lesser extent  fees for ancillary banking services 
non interest income from fees and deposit service charges are below peer group levels 
this is largely the result of the profile of our typical client 
our clients tend to have larger deposit account balances than customers of traditional banks 
because average balances tend to be high  we do not earn high service charge income typical of many retail banks 

table of contents non interest expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of operations 
our growth directly affects the majority of our expense categories 
critical accounting policies generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting  reporting and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions and estimates to apply these principles where actual measurements are not possible or practical 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
reference should also be made to our significant accounting policies set out in the notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such estimates may have a significant impact on the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has reviewed the application of these policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
for privatebancorp  inc  accounting policies that are viewed as critical to us are those relating to estimates and judgments regarding the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the estimation of the valuation of goodwill and the useful lives applied to intangible assets 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based on a review of available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
our allowance for loan losses is reassessed monthly to determine the appropriate level of the allowance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined based on a variety of factors  including assessment of the credit risk of the loans in the portfolio  volume of loans in the portfolio  delinquent loans  impaired loans  evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area  actual charge offs and recoveries during the period and historical loss experience 
the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
management adjusts the allowance for loan losses by recording a provision for loan losses in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance at the level determined appropriate 
loans are charged off when deemed to be uncollectible by management 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was as of december  compared to as of december  goodwill and intangible assets during  the privatebank chicago recorded approximately million in goodwill in connection with the johnson bank illinois acquisition 
during  the company recorded million of goodwill and million in customer intangibles in connection with the acquisition of lodestar 
during  the company recorded million of goodwill in connection with the acquisition of corley financial corporation 
intangible assets are amortized over an estimated useful life of years 
effective january   the company adopted fas no 
 which requires that goodwill and 
table of contents intangible assets that have indefinite lives no longer be amortized but be reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
prior to the adoption of fas no 
 goodwill was being amortized using the straight line method over a period of years 
the company did not incur any goodwill impairment in in adopting fas an annual impairment test of goodwill is performed each year by the company 
impairment losses on recorded goodwill will be recorded as operating expenses 
goodwill at december  was million and million at december  amortization expense related to the lodestar customer intangible assets is expected to be recorded in the amount of  each year for years 
the customer intangible balance as of december  was million 

table of contents consolidated results of operations net income our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our diluted earnings per share increased as compared to the prior year earnings per share 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our earnings per share increased as compared to the prior year earnings per share 
the increase in net income for is primarily attributable to growth in the balance sheet  particularly increases in loans  which were funded by growth in deposits and stabilization of our net interest margin 
increased fee income  mainly from increases in wealth management revenue  also contributed to the improvement in net income during the increase in earnings from operations for as compared to is primarily attributable to growth in the balance sheet  particularly in loans and investment securities  funded by growth in deposits and improvement in our net interest margin 
increased fee income  mainly from increases in wealth management revenue  and income from the sale of residential real estate loans in the secondary market  also contributed to the improvement in income 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets and interest expense and amortization of fees on deposits and borrowings 
interest income includes amortization of loan origination fees recorded from loans 
interest expense includes amortization of prepaid fees on brokered deposits and issuance costs of trust preferred securities 
net interest margin represents the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets during the period 
net interest margin reflects the spread between average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
the volume of non interest bearing funds  largely comprised of demand deposits and capital  also affects the net interest margin 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of

our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
during  increased volumes of interest earning assets at higher rates were offset by increased interest rates on liabilities 
our cost of funds was greater during than  compared to  respectively  and our earning assets yielded in compared to in non interest bearing funds impact net interest margin since they represent non interest bearing sources of funds that are deployed in interest bearing assets 
non interest bearing funds positively impacted net interest margin by at december  and by at december  during  our net interest margin was impacted by increases in the costs of our average interest bearing liabilities throughout the year 
we lengthened the maturity of funding sources  with a resulting increase in our cost of funds 
the increase in cost of funds was primarily due to increases in 
table of contents money market deposit rates  some of which are tied to prime  as well as higher rates paid on short term borrowings and federal home loan bank advances 
the increase in our cost of funds was partially offset by improvements in our yield on earnings assets  which were positively impacted by the increases in the prime rate of interest 
approximately two thirds of the loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate of interest or otherwise adjusts with other short term interest rates 
the rising interest rate environment that we experienced in increased the impact of our non interest bearing funds on our overall net interest margin and also offset the decline in net interest spread on a year over year basis

we made significant changes to funds borrowed during the second half of the year  prepaying a million  fixed rate fhlb advance that was scheduled to mature on december  we replaced the advance with two new fhlb advances totaling million with substantially longer maturities and lower interest rates than the original advance 
late in the third quarter we repaid million outstanding on a line of credit 
during the fourth quarter of we added an additional million of borrowings through the fhlb at market rates or at lower rates of interest than the debt that was refunded 
margin was further improved by a one half percentage point increase on the third quarter fhlb dividend to  the fhlb paid annualized dividends of for the first  second and fourth quarters of a changing interest rate environment has an effect on our net interest margin 
a large portion of our loan portfolio is based on floating interest rates and may reprice faster than our deposits and floating rate borrowings 
for  we expect our net interest margin to decrease slightly if interest rates remain unchanged 
we expect to renew our maturing funding sources at higher rates than what we are currently recognizing 
margin also will be compressed because of reduced dividends on our investment in fhlb chicago stock 
the company s annualized yield on this investment was for the fourth quarter  and will be a maximum of for the first quarter in the event the fhlb chicago substantially reduces the dividend payable on its stock  our interest income and  accordingly  our earnings  may be adversely affected 
during the fourth quarter of  dividends received on our investment in fhlb chicago stock represented million  or  of our interest income on a tax equivalent basis  for the quarter 
we closely monitor the activities of the fhlb chicago  and continue to believe the fhlb chicago stock is a prudent investment for the company 
we expect our net interest margin to remain stable or improve slightly if market interest rates increase relative to levels 
alternatively  if market interest rates decrease  we expect our net interest margin to experience pressure

table of contents the following table shows our allocation of the allowance for loan losses by specific category at the dates shown

december  amount of loans to total loans amount of loans to total loans amount of loans to total loans amount of loans to total loans amount of loans to total loans commercial real estate commercial construction residential real estate personal home equity unallocated total loan quality is continually monitored by management and reviewed by the loan committees of the board of directors of the banks on a monthly basis 
the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses  which is charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses  is determined based on a variety of factors  including assessment of the credit risk of the portfolio  delinquent loans  evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area  actual charge offs during the year and historical loss experience 
the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is supported by all available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
under our methodology  the allowance for loan losses is comprised of the following components specific component of the reserve the specific component of the reserve is determined on a loan by loan basis as part of a regular review of our loan portfolio 
we utilize a loan rating system to assist in developing an internal problem loan identification system watch list as a means for identifying and reporting non performing and potential problem loans 
these loans are allocated specifically identified reserves based on the loan ratings assigned to individual loans 
the specific reserve is based on a loan s current book value compared to the present value of its projected future cash flows  collateral value or market value  as is relevant for the particular loan 
the portion of the provision related to the specific component of the reserve was  during  compared to million in  resulting in an increase in this component of approximately  after giving effect to  in charge offs during the period

table of contents the reserve consists of individual credit relationships that have been allocated specifically identified reserves based on the loan ratings assigned to individual loans and other extensions of credit 
allocated inherent component of the reserve the allocated portion of the inherent component of the reserve is based on management s review of historical and industry charge off experience as well as its judgment regarding loans in each loan category over a period of time that management determines is adequate to reflect longer term economic trends 
loss factors are evaluated by management and adjusted based on current facts and circumstances 
loss factor adjustments reflect management s assessment of the credit risk inherent in each loan category 
the portion of the provision related to the allocated inherent component of the reserve was million during  compared to million during the increase  in  in the allocated portion of the reserve reflects higher loan volumes in every category  particularly commercial  commercial real estate and construction loans 
unallocated inherent components of the reserve the unallocated portion of the inherent component of the reserve is based on management s review of other factors affecting the determination of probable losses inherent in the portfolio  which are not necessarily captured by the application of loss factors 
this portion of the reserve analysis involves the exercise of judgment and reflects consideration such as management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
the portion of the provision related to the unallocated inherent component of the reserve was million in  compared to million in the growth and complexity of the loan portfolio exposes us to larger individual charge offs and is the primary reason for the increase in unallocated reserves 
management s application of the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses resulted in a reserve for credit losses of million at december  compared with million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was as of december   compared to as of december  net charge offs for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively

table of contents it is our policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan for which there exists reasonable doubt as to the payment of interest or principal 
nonaccrual loans are returned to an accrual status when the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the payment of principal or interest 
other than those loans reflected in the table above  we had no significant loans for which the terms had been renegotiated or restructured  or for which there were serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with repayment terms 
we did not have any other real estate owned as of any of the dates shown 
potential problem loans 
in addition to those loans reflected in the table above  we have identified some loans through our problem loan identification process which exhibit a higher than normal credit risk 
loans in this category include loans with characteristics such as past maturity more than days  those that have recent adverse operating cash flow or balance sheet trends  or loans that have general risk characteristics that management believes might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments 
the balance in this category at any reporting period can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections  renegotiations and renewals 
the principal amount of loans in this category as of december  was million 
at december   there were no significant loans which were classified by any bank regulatory agency that are not included above as nonaccrual  past due or restructured

loan concentrations 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
at december   our commercial real estate loans totaled approximately million or of our total loan portfolio 
commercial real estate typically involves higher loan principal amounts  and the repayment of these loans generally is dependant  in large part  on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan 
these loans may be more adversely affected by general conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy

risk management we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
during  we began to hedge interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool 
interest rate risk we use a combination of financial instruments  including medium term and short term financings and variable rate debt instruments and  to a lesser extent  interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related cash flows 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  in we entered into our first interest rate swap transaction in which we agreed to receive a fixed rate in exchange for payment of a floating rate based on an agreed upon notional amount 
the fair value of the swap associated with this fair value hedge was  on december  as market interest rates continued to decline to historic lows in the second half of  the value of our long term tax exempt bank qualified municipal bond portfolio increased

the company and its banking subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors  and the regulators can lower classifications in certain areas 
failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
the prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized  although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition 
if a banking subsidiary is not well capitalized  regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits

liquidity liquidity measures our ability to meet maturing obligations and our existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund our operations and to provide for our clients credit needs 
our liquidity principally depends on our cash flows from our operating activities  investment in and maturity of assets  changes in balances of deposits and borrowings and our ability to borrow funds in the money or capital markets 
liquidity management involves planning to meet anticipated funding needs at a reasonable cost 
liquidity management is guided by policies  formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks asset liability committees  which take into account the marketability of assets  the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments 
our principal sources of funds are deposits  short term borrowings and capital contributions by privatebancorp to the banks funded by proceeds from draws on our line of credit or through new capital 
our core deposits  the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long term relationships generally established with our clients  are available to provide long term liquidity 
at december   of our total assets were funded by core deposits  compared to at december  core deposits for purposes of this ratio are defined as to include all deposits including time deposits but excluding brokered deposits and public funds 
time deposits are included as core deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us 
over the past several years  our clients have chosen to keep the maturities of their time deposits short 
in the event that certain of these certificates of deposit are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the bank  unless those deposits are replaced with other core deposits  brokered deposits  borrowed money or capital  we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs 
we have continued to use fhlb advances and brokered deposits as alternative methods of funding growth 
during  we first utilized brokered deposits as a funding tool to enhance liquidity in anticipation of increasing loan demand 
during and we maintained our brokered deposits program in order to fund liquidity of the privatebank st 
louis and the privatebank st 
louis 
in we expect to continue to rely on brokered deposits together with increased fhlb advances as alternative methods of funding growth and may increase the level of both brokered deposits and fhlb advances 
our asset liability management policy currently limits our use of brokered deposits to levels no more than of total deposits 
we do not expect our threshold limitation to limit our ability to implement our growth plan 
we will first look toward internally generated deposits as funding sources  but plan to supplement our funding needs with wholesale funding sources as needed 
consistent with this policy  brokered deposits to total deposits were of total deposits at december   compared to of total deposits at december  subject to the waiver of the required notice period upon redemption  our investment in fhlb chicago stock is a source of liquidity for us

we are required to maintain a ratio of of fhlb borrowings to fhlb stock 
as of december   we had million dollars in advances from the fhlb million from the fhlb chicago and million from the fhlb des moines 
we were required to hold million in fhlb chicago stock at december  and the remaining million of fhlb chicago stock can be redeemed 
fhlb chicago has communicated to us that a substantial amount of stock can be redeemed immediately upon a request by us  however  fhlb can legally require six months advance notice of the stock sale before the stock is actually liquidated for cash at its par value 
alternatively  fhlb can redeem  at any time  any fhlb stock we own  in excess of the required minimum 
as a result of strong loan growth and to take advantage of increasing yields available in other earning assets  on january   the company redeemed million of its fhlb chicago stock  reducing this investment to million 
the fhlb chicago paid a annualized dividend in the first  second and third quarters of and a annualized fourth quarter dividend  and will pay a maximum of for the first quarter of fhlb dividends are generally paid one and a half months subsequent to each quarter end 
the company closely monitors the activities of the fhlb chicago  and continues to believe the fhlb chicago stock is a prudent investment for the company 
in a press release dated june   the fhlb chicago announced that it had entered into a written agreement with its regulator agreeing to implement various changes to enhance its risk management  capital management  governance and internal control practices 
the fhlb chicago agreed to limit their growth rate as well as maintain a capital ratio of versus a regulatory minimum of  which may impact the future level of dividends the fhlb chicago may pay 
on february   a three year business and capital management plan for the fhlb chicago was accepted by its regulator  fulfilling a key requirement of the bank s written agreement 
under the plan  the bank committed to reduce the amount of excess  or voluntary  stock owned by its member financial institutions  measured as a percentage of regulatory capital 
as of december   about billion of the bank s capital stock  or  was held by its members voluntarily  beyond the amount they were required to hold as a condition of membership 
the business plan calls for that percentage to be gradually reduced to or less by the end of the bank has also committed to adopt a new dividend policy requiring its dividend payout ratio in a given quarter not to exceed of its adjusted core net income for that quarter 
while the written agreement remains in effect  quarterly dividends of greater than on an annualized basis will require regulatory approval 
during the twelve months ended december   we increased the level of fhlb advances while the level of brokered deposits decreased 
the fhlb advances that we have entered into in are at longer maturities and higher interest rates relative to the maturing fhlb advances 
these higher costing advances will compress net interest margin in the short term and reflect the impact of a flattening yield curve during and into during  we expect to continue to utilize fhlb advances as a funding source to the extent that rates on fhlb advances are more attractive than other sources of funding

our total availability of overnight fed funds borrowings is not a committed line of credit  and is dependent upon lender availability 
in addition  we currently have available borrowing capacity of million under the million credit facility at the holding company 
we utilize this credit facility from time to time for general business purposes 
however  at december   we held no borrowings outstanding under the revolving line 
impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry 
under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our financial strategy  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
asset liability management policy is established by our investment committee of our board of directors and is monitored by management 
our asset liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate 
these standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations  liquidity  loan limits as a percentage of funding sources  exposure to correspondent banks and brokers  and reliance on non core deposits 
the policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors 
the investment policy complements the asset liability management policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities 
these criteria include approved types of securities  brokerage sources  terms of investment  quality standards  and diversification 
we measure the impact of interest rate changes on our income statement through the use of gap analysis 
the gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods 
during any given time period  if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets  a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time 
conversely  a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates 
we have structured our assets and liabilities to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment 
we manage our gap position at the one year horizon 
depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over 
table of contents the short and long term  we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset liability management policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk 
our policy states that we shall maintain a rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities position at the one year horizon between and 
our position at december  was and was within the guidelines of our policy 
we have continued to maintain our gap position set by our policy guidelines and expect to continue to operate in this manner as long as the general rate structure of the economy and our business opportunities remain consistent 
therefore  generally speaking  a short term rise in interest rates will negatively impact our earnings  while a short term drop in interest rates would positively impact our earnings 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our income statement 
for example  a rapid drop in interest rates might cause our loans to repay at a more rapid pace and certain mortgage related investments to prepay more quickly than projected 
this could mitigate some of the benefits of falling rates that are expected when negatively gapped 
conversely  a rapid rise in rates could give us an opportunity to increase our margins and slow the rate of repayment on our mortgage related loans  which would increase our returns

the simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis 
assets and liabilities then reprice based on their terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period 
the model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred 
december  december  basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points percentage change in net interest income due to an immediate and basis point change in interest rates over a one year time horizon this table shows that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points on december   net interest income would increase by over a one year period  as compared to a net interest income increase of if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift of basis points at december  due to current market interest rates  a basis point shift is presented for december  as a more reasonable illustration of possible rate changes 
the measurement of a basis point instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve at december  would result in an increase in net interest income of over a one year period as compared to measured on the basis of the december  portfolio 
at december  
table of contents  if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of  we would have suffered a decline in net interest income of  as compared to decline measured on the basis of the december  portfolio 
changes in the effect on net interest income from a and basis point movement at december   compared to december  are due to the timing and nature of the repricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame 
the preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  changes in deposit levels  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change 
we continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets  sell investment securities  or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk
