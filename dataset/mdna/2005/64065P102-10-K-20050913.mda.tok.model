back to index item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide software  services and solutions to enable thin client computing  which is a computing architecture for business customers that is designed to be easier to manage  more secure  more reliable  and more cost effective solution than traditional pc based  client server computing 
our software and management tools secure  power and manage a new generation of smart thin client appliances that utilize the benefits of open  industry standard technologies used in the pc industry to create new alternatives to full function personal computers and green screen terminals used in business 
our software runs on thin client appliances and personal computers  and enables these devices to be secured and centrally managed  as well as to connect to mainframes  midrange  unix  linux and host systems 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of thin client appliance systems  which include the appliance device and related software and to a lesser extent from teemtalk host access software for servers and pcs  ezremote manager central management software  neoware image manager software and services such as training and integration 
to date  sales of standalone software products and services have not exceeded of our consolidated revenues for any period 
we sell our products and services worldwide through our direct sales force  distributors  our alliances with ibm and 
lenovo and other indirect channels  such as resellers and systems integrators 
in addition to our headquarters in the united states  we maintain offices in the uk  germany  france  austria  sweden  australia  and the netherlands 
our international sales of thin client products are primarily made through distributors and resellers and are collectible primarily in us dollars  while the associated operating expenses are payable in foreign currencies 
revenues from europe  the middle east and africa emea  based on the location of our customers  were as follows emea revenues    percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period strategy the market for thin client appliances is part of the enterprise personal computer pc market 
we market our thin client appliances as alternatives to pcs in certain target markets 
our strategies are to focus on selling thin client software and appliance products that compete effectively with pcs  increasing sales to large enterprise customers  primarily through our relationships with ibm and lenovo  and secondarily through other resellers and directly to end users  and to execute marketing initiatives designed to grow the thin client segment of the pc industry 
we utilize third parties that we believe have strong market positions in the server based computing market to expand our sales and marketing efforts  which allows us to develop new customer relationships as well as gain access to new markets 
we expect to continue to grow our business organically and through acquisitions 
our acquisition strategy is focused on enhancing our geographic reach  enhancing our channels of distribution  as well as acquiring businesses with products that can be sold through our existing channels to the same end user customers  leveraging our existing organization 
we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and partnerships in the future 

back to index starting in the september quarter  we will begin recording stock based compensation expense as calculated under fas no 
r 
while we have not yet completed our analysis  we expect the non cash impact of stock based compensation expense during fiscal to be in the range of to million before income taxes 
such amounts may change as a result of additional grants  forfeitures  modifications in assumptions and other factors 
the statement regarding anticipated fiscal expenses below do not include any impact related to expensing of stock options according to sfas no 
r 
in april  in connection with the sale of ibm s personal computing division to lenovo group limited  we entered into an agreement with lenovo  under which lenovo can purchase our products under the same terms as ibm 
our agreement with ibm remains in effect 
acquisitions on april   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of qualystem technology sas  a provider of software that streams windows and application components on demand from a server to other servers  personal computers  and thin clients 
as a result of the qualystem acquisition  we acquired intellectual property and technology and non compete agreements 
on march   we acquired the thintune thin client business of esesix computer which included customer lists  intellectual property and technology  and also entered into reseller  supplier and non competition agreements and on march  acquired all of the outstanding shares of esesix tech  esesix computer s development and engineering affiliate 
esesix computer together with esesix tech are collectively referred to as the thintune thin client business 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of mangrove systems sas  a provider of linux software solutions 
as a result of the mangrove acquisition  we acquired customer lists  intellectual property and technology and non compete agreements 
on january  we entered into an asset purchase agreement which was amended on june  to acquire the televideo thin client business including all thin client assets  certain contract obligations  a trademark license  product brands  customer lists  customer contracts and non competition agreements 
the acquisition is expected to close in october we also entered into a reseller agreement with televideo as of january  that named neoware as its exclusive distributor and sales agent and we commenced selling of the televideo products on that date 
on september   we acquired the thin client business of visara  including customer lists  intellectual property and technology  and also entered into reseller  supplier and non competition agreements our acquisition strategy is to fully integrate acquired businesses into our core business to generate increased sales  as well as synergies for the company as a whole 
this generally involves transitioning channel partners and end customers to our core products and utilizing acquired development and sales resources to support our core development  sales and marketing activities 
accordingly  we do not believe that it is meaningful to separately report revenue from our acquired businesses 
financial highlights net revenue  gross profit margin  and earnings per share are key measurements of our financial results 
for the fiscal year  net revenue was million  an increase of from fiscal gross profit margins were for fiscal as compared to in fiscal the revenue increase and gross profit margin percentage decrease is consistent with our previously announced strategy to introduce new lower priced products that compete more effectively with personal computers and to pursue large enterprise customers 
diluted earnings per share increased to for fiscal  compared to in fiscal  as a result of increased earnings from revenue growth and the impact of a write off in fiscal of million of costs related to acquisitions that were not completed 

back to index for fiscal  net revenue was million  an increase of from fiscal gross profit margins were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal diluted earnings per share decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  as a result of the write off in fiscal of million of costs related to acquisitions that were not completed as well as and an additional  diluted shares outstanding primarily from the sale of stock in july partially offset by increased earnings from revenue growth 
in fiscal our operating results were affected by several factors  including  lack of growth in the pc market  changes in the competitive landscape and contributions from the teemtalk acquisition 
in fiscal  we grew more slowly than in prior years  and responded by changing our strategy by introducing new lower priced products that compete more effectively with personal computers and to pursue large enterprise customers 
as of june   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  compared to million at june  we used million of cash in fiscal for acquisitions  plus million of stock for the mangrove acquisition and generated million of cash from operations and received million of cash from the exercise of stock options 
we depend upon a limited number of sole source suppliers for our thin client appliance products and for several of the components in them 
one of our suppliers that provides a substantial portion of our thin client products informed us in late fiscal that it was experiencing cash liquidity constraints and was evaluating and undertaking financial restructuring actions 
in december  we agreed to accommodate the supplier by purchasing products for inventory in advance of our contractual obligations and we anticipated continuing this practice until such time as the supplier s cash liquidity situation was resolved 
in the quarter ended march   this supplier s liquidity improved and we reduced our advance purchase of inventory 
however  in the event that this supplier were to experience future cash liquidity constraints  we could be requested to make advance purchases which would decrease our cash balance 
additionally  we could face an interruption in the supply of a substantial portion of our products 
although we have identified alternative suppliers that could produce comparable products  it is likely there would be an interruption of supply during any transition  which would limit our ability to ship product to fully meet customer demand 
if this were to happen  our revenue would decline and our profitability would be adversely impacted 
one new domestic supplier required an advance payment of million at june   which was recorded as a prepaid expense  to fund a portion of the initial start up production quantities related to a larger order 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill accounting for income taxes these policies and estimates and our procedures related to these policies and estimates are described in detail below and under specific areas within the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations 
please refer to note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s accounting policies and estimates 

back to index revenue recognition for each type of arrangement  we make judgments regarding the fair value of multiple elements contained in our arrangements  judgments regarding whether fees are fixed or determinable  judgments regarding whether collectability is probable  and judgments related to accounting for potential distributor stock rotation rights and price protection 
these judgments  and their effect on revenue recognition  are discussed below 
multiple element arrangements net revenues include sales of thin client appliance systems  which include the appliance device and related software  maintenance and technical support 
we follow aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  for revenue recognition because the software component of the thin client appliance system is more than incidental to the thin client appliance systems as a whole 
these products and services are sold either separately or as part of a multiple element arrangement 
revenue is recognized on product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue related to post contract support services is generally recognized with the initial product sale when the fee is included with the initial product fee  post contract services are for one year or less  the estimated cost of providing such services during the arrangement is insignificant  and unspecified upgrades and enhancements offered during the period are expected to continue to be minimal and infrequent 
otherwise  revenue from extended warranty and post contract support service contracts is recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized over the term of the related support period 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of these amounts is determined by the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
the fee is fixed or determinable we make judgments at the outset of an arrangement regarding whether the fees are fixed or determinable 
the majority of our payment terms are within to days after invoice date 
we review arrangements that have payment terms extending beyond days on a case by case basis to determine if the fee is fixed or determinable 
if we determine at the outset of an arrangement that the fees are not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the fees become due and payable 
collection is probable we make judgments at the outset of an arrangement regarding whether collection is probable 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have had a history of successful collections 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process to evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay 
if we determine at the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable  revenue is recognized upon receipt of payment 
stock rotation rights and price protection we provide certain distributors with stock rotation rights and price protection 
stock rotation rights are generally limited to a maximum amount per quarter and require a corresponding order of equal or greater value at the time of the stock rotation 
we provide price protection as a rebate in the event that we reduce the price of products that our distributors have yet to sell to end users 
we estimate potential stock rotation and price protection claims based on historical experience and the level of inventories in the distribution channel and reduce current period revenue accordingly 
if we cannot reasonably estimate claims related to stock rotations and price protection at the outset of an arrangement  we recognize revenue when the claims can be reasonably estimated 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions  we allocate portions of the purchase price to intangible assets  consisting of acquired technology  distributor and customer relationships  non compete agreements and trade names based on independent appraisals  with the remainder allocated to goodwill 

back to index we assess the realizability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are required to perform a sfas no 
impairment test at least annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we have determined that the reporting unit level is our sole operating segment 
the test for goodwill is a two step process first  we compare the carrying amount of our reporting unit  which is the book value of the entire company  to the fair value of our reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we have to perform the second step of the process 
if not  no further testing is needed 
if the second part of the analysis is required  we would allocate the fair value of our reporting unit to all assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
we would then compare the implied fair value of our reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit s goodwill exceeded its fair value  we would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess 
we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles  for impairment when events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we determine that one or more impairment indicators are present for an asset  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  we compare the fair value to the book value of the asset 
if the fair value is less than the book value  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
some of the events that we consider as impairment indicators for our long lived assets  including goodwill  are our significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  our net book value compared to our market capitalization  significant adverse economic and industry trends  significant decrease in the market value of an asset  the extent that we use an asset or changes in the manner that we use it  and significant changes to an asset since we acquired it 
we have not recorded an impairment loss on goodwill or other long lived assets 
at june   goodwill and intangible assets are million and million  respectively 
a decrease in the fair value of our business could trigger an impairment charge related to goodwill and or intangible assets 
accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each federal  state and international jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires that we estimate the current tax expense as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities  including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our balance sheet and results of operations 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on our assessment  establish a valuation allowance  if required 

back to index results of operations net revenues in thousands net revenue    percentage change over prior period we derive revenues primarily from the sale of thin client appliances  which include an appliance device and related software 
the percentage increase in net revenues in fiscal reflects increases in revenue from our thin client appliance products representing points of the increase and software point compared to increases in sales of thin client appliances points and software points in fiscal the increase in thin client appliance systems revenue in fiscal was driven by a increase in unit sales from increasing market acceptance of our thin client products  the increase in our customer base from our core sales activities and those from recent acquisitions and our alliance with ibm and lenovo 
the increase in net revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to a increase in unit sales of our thin client appliance products sold as a result of the increasing acceptance in the marketplace of thin client technology and our increased access to customers as a result of our greater market share  our alliance with ibm  and our larger sales organization 
such increases in both years are partially offset by a decline in the average selling prices due to changes in product mix and increased competition 
software revenues increased in fiscal over fiscal due to the impact of the teemtalk acquisition 
cost of revenues and gross profit margin in thousands cost of revenue    percentage change over prior period gross profit margin cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of thin client appliances  which include an appliance device and related software  and  to a lesser extent  overhead including salaries and related benefits for personnel who fulfill product orders  delivery services  amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions and distribution costs 
the increase in cost of revenues in fiscal is primarily the result of unit sales growth and to a lesser extent to increased amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions completed in fiscal and increases in inventory and warranty reserves due to higher unit sales volume 
the increase in cost of revenues in fiscal is primarily the result of sales growth offset by lower material costs 
cost of revenues in fiscal include  of amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal we continue to benefit from manufacturing efficiencies and component cost reductions achieved through our outsourcing model 
this model depends on high volume production of our thin client appliance products using components commonly used in personal computers 
we have also benefited from license fee expense reductions due to the acquisition of the teemtalk software business  which we previously licensed prior to fiscal under a royalty fee agreement  and reductions in other software license fees 
the change in gross profit margin in fiscal is the result of increased sales to high volume large enterprise customers which generally provide a lower selling price and the impact of competition 
the change in gross profit margin in fiscal is attributable to the increased sales of higher margin software  as well as component and license fee cost reductions 
gross margins for fiscal are projected to be in the to range  including approximately  per quarter of amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions 
gross margins will likely vary from this range by one or two percentage points in any particular quarter 
gross margins are expected to fluctuate in the future due to changes in product mix  including our e product  which carry higher selling prices but lower average percentage gross margins  reduction in sales prices due to increased sales to large enterprise customers and increased price competition  the percentage of revenues derived from thin client appliance systems  and software and changes in the cost of thin client appliances  memory and other components 

back to index sales and marketing in thousands sales and marketing    as a percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  commissions  advertising  direct marketing  the cost of trade shows  amortization of intangibles related to customer and distribution relationships and other costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts 
sales and marketing expense declined as a percentage of revenue in fiscal as we primarily used our existing sales and marketing infrastructure to cover the larger customer base generated from our internal growth and acquisitions 
amortization of acquisition related intangibles was million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal this increase was partially offset by reductions in labor costs and third party marketing costs  both related to improved management of the sales and marketing activities 
the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal is primarily the result of increasing our organizational investments in the united states and europe  including personnel additions and targeted marketing initiatives designed to stimulate growth in the thin client segment of the pc market 
the increase in fiscal also reflects amortization of intangibles related to customer relationships resulting from the acquisition in fiscal of the teemtalk software business 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal to increase as a percentage of revenue at the beginning of fiscal  but to remain in the same range as fiscal as percentage of revenues as revenues grow 
spending levels in any one quarter will vary depending upon the timing of individual marketing initiatives 
research and development in thousands research and development    as a percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  and other engineering related costs 
the increase in research and development expense in fiscal and fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in staff levels  including additional personnel from acquisitions and a write off of  of acquisition related in process research and development 
we believe that a significant level of research and development investment is required to remain competitive and expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal to increase as a percentage of revenue at the beginning of fiscal  but to remain in the same range as fiscal as a percentage of revenues as revenues grow 
general and administrative in thousands general and administration    as a percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  corporate insurance  such as director and officer liability insurance  fees related to the obligations of a public company and fees for legal  audit and tax services 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in staffing levels  increases in compensation levels and added costs for legal  accounting and compliance activities associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the increase in fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in staffing levels  increases in compensation levels  increases in fees associated with our eie tax benefit discussed below and increases in director and officer liability insurance 
the increase in staffing levels reflects additional personnel related to our organizational investments in executive management and other positions 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal  but decline slightly as a percentage of revenues as revenues grow 

back to index abandoned acquisition costs during fiscal and fiscal  we wrote off  and million  respectively  in direct and incremental costs  which were previously deferred  related to acquisitions that were not consummated 
these costs consisted primarily of advisory  legal  third party due diligence and accounting fees 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions and  if we do not complete them  the cost of pursuing acquisitions will impact our profitability 
income taxes in thousands income taxes benefit    effective tax rate our effective tax rate in fiscal and fiscal differed from the combined federal and state statutory rates due primarily to the tax benefit from the extraterritorial income exclusion eie 
the eie provides a tax benefit by excluding a portion of income from qualified foreign sales from gross income 
in fiscal we also benefited to a lesser extent from foreign income taxes in lower tax rate countries 
during fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of  from the recovery of eie deductions in prior years  which had an impact of percentage points on the effective tax rate 
in october the eie was repealed and will be phased out through calendar year as a result  we expect our effective tax rate to increase as the eie is phased out over the next two fiscal years  however  the impact of the manufacturing deduction for the jobs creation act has not been determined at this time and that  along with other initiatives we may undertake  could have a favorable impact on our effective income tax rate beginning in fiscal in addition  certain of our recent acquisitions are located in foreign tax jurisdictions which may have an impact on our overall effective tax rate 
based on these factors  we estimate that our effective tax rate will be for fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had net working capital of million 
our principal sources of liquidity include million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and an offering basis loan agreement with a bank under which we can request short term loan advances up to an aggregate principal amount of million 
upon such request  the bank would provide us with the interest rate  terms and conditions applicable to the requested loan advance 
the funds would be committed upon agreement of such terms by both parties 
unless otherwise agreed to by the bank  the term for any advance cannot exceed days 
there were no borrowings under the offering basis loan agreement during fiscal cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by million during fiscal  primarily as a result of cash used for acquisitions of businesses that totaled million  plus million of stock used for business acquisitions  partially offset by million of cash provided by operating activities and million of proceeds from financing activities  primarily from the exercise of stock options and other net financing  investing and foreign exchange activities 
we have entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the televideo thin client business which requires the payment of million upon consummation of the transaction which is expected to close in october in addition there are potential earn out amounts related to contingent consideration associated with the recent acquisitions completed by the company 
generally these earn outs are based on achieved levels of revenue during the twelve months subsequent to completion of the transaction 
cash flows provided by operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is payments from our customers for the purchase or license of our products 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the purchase of thin client appliances  software licenses  personnel related expenditures and marketing expenses 
cash flow from operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal is due to i a net decrease in cash from increases in accounts receivable and inventory resulting in a million net decrease in operating cash flows in versus required to fund the sales growth experienced in fiscal and ii a million decrease in the tax benefit from stock options exercises  partially offset by i increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting in a million net increase in cash from operating activities in verse as a result of the increase in sales volume and an increase in income tax payable and ii an increase of in net income exclusive of amortization of intangible assets  in process research and development and depreciation 
inventory also increased as a result of acquisitions made during fiscal and advance purchases of inventory to support the cash flow needs of a major supplier 
the increase in fiscal is primarily due to increased collections from customers  increased intangibles amortization due to the purchase of the teemtalk business  decreased payments to vendors  increases in prepaid income taxes  and decreases in deferred income taxes 

back to index cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal and fiscal included cash used for acquisitions of businesses totaling million in fiscal and million in fiscal additionally  we used million of stock for the mangrove acquisition 
other investing activities included purchases and sales of short term investments  which we typically purchase with surplus cash 
cash flows provided by financing activities cash flows from financing activities included million and  from the exercise of employee stock options in fiscal and  respectively 
financing activities in fiscal also included issuance of million shares of common stock in a private placement that provided million cash  net of transaction costs 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of june  in thousands total and and and thereafter product purchase obligations   operating and capital leases  other purchase obligations the above table excludes potential amounts under contractual earn out related to our recent acquisitions and contingent amounts payable pursuant to arrangements with executive officers which provide for severance obligations in the event of a change in control of up to million 
we expect to fund current operations and other cash expenditures through the use of available cash  cash from operations  funds available under our credit facility and  potentially  new debt or equity financings 
management believes that we will have sufficient funds from current cash  operations and available financing to fund operations and cash expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  we may seek additional sources of funding in order to fund acquisitions  including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our million shelf registration  which was declared effective by the sec on september  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first annual period beginning after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include the modified prospective and modified retrospective methods 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under current accounting rules 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
total cash flow will remain unchanged from cash flow as it would have been reported under prior accounting rules 
we are in the process of determining the impact of sfas no 
r  which will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
the actual effects of adopting sfas r will depend on numerous factors including the amounts of share based payments granted in the future  modifications to existing awards  the valuation model used  changes in valuation assumptions and forfeitures

 accounting for electronic waste obligations sfas no 
 which requires an entity to recognize an asset retirement liability for its obligation to dispose of electronic equipment for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after june  we have no obligations with respect to historical waste at june  unless it replaces equipment in the future 
the european union eu has adopted two directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment sold in the eu 
the first of these is the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive  which directs eu member states to enact laws  regulations and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electrical and electronic equipment are financially responsible for specified collection  recycling  treatment  and environmentally sound disposal of products placed on the market after august   and from products in use prior to that date that are being replaced 
the eu has also adopted the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive 
the rohs directive restricts the use of lead  mercury  and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on the market in the european union after july  we are currently evaluating the impact of these directives 
similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other areas  including in the united states  the cumulative impact of which could be significant in the future if we are unable to recover these costs in the price of our products 
factors affecting neoware and future operating results operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and  therefore  prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition include  but are not limited to  the following our future results may be affected by industry trends and specific risks in our business 
some of the factors that could materially affect our future results include those described below 
during the past two years  we have increased operating expenses significantly as a foundation for us to stimulate growth in our market  and we expect to increase our operating expenses during fiscal if we do not increase revenues or appropriately manage further increases in operating expenses  our profitability will suffer 
our business has grown through both internal expansion and business acquisitions  and this has put pressure on our infrastructure  internal systems and managerial resources 
the number of our employees increased from employees at august  to employees at august  our new employees include a number of senior executive officers and other key managerial  technical  sales and marketing personnel  as well as foreign employees 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our infrastructure  including operating and administrative systems and controls  and continue managing and integrating our personnel in an efficient manner 
our business may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively and coordinate among our executive  engineering  finance  marketing  sales  operations and customer support organizations 
in addition  because of the growth of our foreign operations  we now have facilities located in multiple countries  and we have limited experience coordinating a geographically separated organization 

back to index although we have generated operating profits for the past four fiscal years  we have a prior history of losses and may experience losses in the future  which could result in the market price of our common stock declining 
although we have generated operating profits in the past four fiscal years  we incurred net losses in prior periods 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses 
our operating expenses may increase in the future reflecting the hiring of additional key personnel as we continue to implement our growth strategy  including our plan to introduce new products to compete with pc based solutions and other thin client companies  and our planned investment in continuing to commercialize the technology we have acquired 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to maintain profitability 
if we do not maintain profitability  the market price for our common stock may decline 
our financial resources may not be enough for our capital and corporate development needs  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing 
a failure to maintain and increase our revenues would likely cause us to incur losses and negatively impact the price of our common stock 
our gross margins can vary significantly  based upon a variety of factors 
if we are unable to sustain adequate gross margins we may be unable to reduce operating expenses in the short term  resulting in losses 
our gross margins can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on average selling prices  fixed costs in relation to revenue levels and the mix of our business  including the percentage of revenues derived from thin client appliances  software  third party products and consulting services 
our gross profit margin also varies in response to competitive market conditions as well as periodic fluctuations in the cost of memory and other significant components 
the pc market in which we compete remains very competitive  and although we intend to continue our efforts to reduce the cost of our products  there can be no certainty that we will not be required to reduce prices of our products without compensating reductions in the cost to produce our products in order to maintain or increase our market share or to meet competitors price reductions 
our marketing strategy is targeted at increasing the size of the thin client segment of the pc industry  in part by lowering prices to make thin clients more competitive with personal computers  and in addition by selling a larger percentage of products to large enterprise customers  who typically demand lower prices because of their volume purchases 
this strategy has resulted in  and may in the future result in  a decline in our gross margins 
additionally  we have recently introduced new products  including our neoware e product line  which has higher average selling prices but lower percentage gross margins than our traditional products 
if our sales do not continue to increase as a result of these strategies  our profitability will decline  and we may experience losses 
our business is dependent on customer adoption of thin client appliances as an alternative to personal computers  and a decrease in their rates of adoption could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues 
we are dependent on the growing use of thin client appliances to perform discrete tasks for corporate and internet based networks to increase our revenues 
if thin client appliances are not accepted by corporations as an alternative to personal computers  the result would be slower than anticipated revenue growth or even a decline in our revenues 
thin client appliances have historically represented a very small percentage of the overall pc market  and  if sales do not grow as a percentage of the pc market  or if the overall pc market were to decline  our revenues may not grow or may decline 
we may not be able to effectively compete against pc and thin client providers as a result of their greater financial resources and brand awareness 
in the desktop pc market  we face significant competition from makers of traditional personal computers  many of which are larger companies that have greater name recognition than we have 
in addition  we face significant competition from thin client providers  including hewlett packard  wyse technology and other smaller companies 
increased competition may negatively affect our business and future operating results by leading to price reductions  higher selling expenses or a reduction in our market share 
our strategy to seek to increase our share of the overall pc market by targeting our core markets may create increased pressure  including pricing pressure  on certain of our thin client appliance products 
while we believe that this will enable us to increase our revenues  there is no assurance that we will be successful in this approach 
in fact  our implementation of this strategy may result in reductions in margins as we compete to attract business 
our inability to successfully implement this strategy could have an adverse impact on our revenues 

back to index our future competitive performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to continually develop and introduce new products and services with better prices and performance than offered by our competitors  offer a wide range of products  and offer high quality products and services 
if we are unable to offer products and services that compete successfully with the products and services offered by our competitors  including pc manufacturers  our business and our operating results would be harmed 
in addition  if in responding to competitive pressures  we are forced to lower the prices of our products and services and we are unable to reduce our costs  our business and operating results would be harmed 
we may not be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions we may complete  which may materially adversely affect our growth and our operating results 
as part of our business strategy  we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding  and enter into agreements relating to  possible acquisitions  strategic alliances and outsourcing transactions in order to further our business objectives 
in order to pursue this strategy successfully  we must identify suitable candidates for these transactions  complete these transactions  some of which may be complex  and manage post closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees 
integration and other risks of acquisitions  strategic alliances and outsourcing transactions can be more pronounced for more complicated transactions  or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously 
however  if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives  we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally  we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses 
since june  we have completed eight acquisitions and entered into an alliance with ibm  and we may make additional acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
there is no assurance that we will successfully integrate the three european acquisitions we completed in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year or future acquisitions into our business 
we may be unable to retain key employees or key business relationships of the acquired businesses  consolidate it infrastructures  manage supply chain integration  combine administrative  research and development and other operations and combine product offerings  and integration of the businesses may divert the attention and resources of our management 
our failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
even if such acquisitions are successfully integrated  we may not receive the expected benefits of the transactions if we find that the acquired business does not further our business strategy or that we paid more than what the business was worth 
managing acquisitions and alliances requires management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
as a result  the effects of any completed or future transactions on financial results may differ from our expectations 
during fiscal  we spent approximately million pursuing acquisitions that we did not complete 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions  and if we do not complete them  the cost of pursuing acquisitions will impact our profitability 
our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly sales is limited  although our costs are relatively fixed in the short term  and we expect our business to be affected by rapid technological change  which may adversely affect our quarterly operating results 
our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly sales is limited  which makes it difficult to predict the quarterly revenues that we will recognize 
in addition  most of our costs are for personnel and facilities  which are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we have a shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses  we may be unable to reduce our expenses quickly enough to avoid losses 
as a result  our quarterly operating results could fluctuate 

back to index future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations based on a wide variety of factors  including linearity our quarterly sales have historically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of sales occur in the last month of the quarter 
this pattern makes prediction of revenues and earnings for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition  significant orders we are subject to variances in our quarterly operating results because of the fluctuations in the timing of our receipt of large orders 
if even a small number of large orders are delayed until after a quarter ends  our operating results could vary substantially from quarter to quarter and net income could be substantially less than expected 
conversely  if even a small number of large orders are completed in an earlier quarter than that which was anticipated  our revenues and net income could be substantially higher than expected  making it possible that sales and net income in future periods may decline sequentially  and seasonality we have experienced seasonal reductions in business activity in some quarters based upon customer activity and based upon our partners seasonality 
this pattern has generally resulted in lower sales in our first and third quarters than in the prior sequential quarters 
stock based compensation expense starting in the quarter ending september   we will begin recording stock based compensation expense as calculated under fas no 
r 
while we have not yet completed our analysis  we expect the non cash impact of stock based compensation expense during fiscal to be in the range of to million 
such amounts may change as a result of additional grants  forfeitures  modifications in assumptions and other factors 
there are factors that may affect the market acceptance of our products  some of which are beyond our control  including the following the growth and changing requirements of the thin client segment of the pc market  the quality  price  performance and total cost of ownership of our products compared to personal computers  the availability  price  quality and performance of competing products and technologies  and the successful development of our relationships with software providers  original equipment manufacturers and existing and potential channel partners 
we may not succeed in developing and marketing our software and thin client appliance products and our operating results may decline as a result 
because some of our products use embedded versions of microsoft windows as their operating system  an inability to license these operating systems on favorable terms could impair our ability to introduce new products and maintain market share 
we may not be able to introduce new products on a timely basis because some of our products use embedded versions of microsoft windows as their operating system 
microsoft provides windows to us  and we do not have access to the source code for certain versions of the windows operating system 
if microsoft fails to continue to enhance and develop its embedded operating systems  or if we are unable to license these operating systems on favorable terms  our operations may suffer 
because some of our products use linux as their operating system  the failure of linux developers to enhance and develop the linux kernel could impair our ability to release new products and maintain market share 
we may not be able to release new products on a timely basis because some of our products use linux as their operating system 
the heart of linux  the linux kernel  is maintained by third parties 
if this group of developers fails to further develop the linux kernel  we would have to either rely on another party to further develop the kernel or develop it ourselves  which would increase our costs and slow our development efforts 

back to index actions taken by the sco group sco could impact the sale of our linux products  negatively affecting sales of some of our products 
sco has taken legal action against ibm and certain other corporations  and sent letters to linux customers alleging that certain linux kernels infringe on sco s unix intellectual property and other rights  and that sco intends to aggressively protect those rights 
while we are not a party to any legal proceeding with sco  since some of our products use linux as their operating system  sco s allegations  regardless of merit  could adversely affect sales of such products 
sco has brought claims against certain end user customers of the linux operating system and threatened to bring claims against other end users of linux for copyright violations arising out of the facts alleged in sco s lawsuit against ibm 
some of these claims could be indemnified under indemnities we have given or may give to certain customers 
in the event that claims for indemnification are brought against the customers that we have indemnified  we could incur expenses reimbursing the customers for their costs  and if the claims were successful  for damages 
because we depend on sole source  limited source and foreign source suppliers for the design and manufacture of our thin client products and for key components in our thin client appliance products  we are susceptible to supply shortages that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time  if at all  and result in lost sales 
in addition  our outsourcing activities for other function may fail to reduce costs and may disrupt operations 
we depend upon single source suppliers for the design and manufacture of our thin client appliance products and for several of the components in them 
we also depend on limited sources to supply several other industry standard components 
the third party designers and manufacturers of our thin client products have access to our intellectual property which increases the risk of infringement or misappropriation of this intellectual property 
we primarily rely on foreign suppliers  which subjects us to risks associated with foreign operations such as the imposition of unfavorable governmental controls or other trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  political instability and currency fluctuations 
a weakening dollar could result in greater costs to us for our components 
severe acute respiratory syndrome and similar medical crises could also disrupt manufacturing processes and result in quarantines being imposed in the future 
we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience shortages of  or difficulties in acquiring  certain components 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of thin client appliances that are bundled with our software 
third parties design and produce these thin client appliances for us  and we typically do not have long term supply contracts with them obligating them to continue producing products for us 
the absence of such agreements means that  with little or no notice  these suppliers could refuse to continue to manufacture all or some of our products that we require or change the terms under which they manufacture our products 
if our suppliers were to stop manufacturing our products  we might be unable to replace the lost manufacturing capacity on a timely basis 
if we experience shortages of these products  or of their components  we may not be able to deliver our products to our customers  and our revenues would decline 
if these suppliers were to change the terms under which they manufacture for us  our manufacturing costs could increase and our cost of revenues could increase  resulting in a decline in gross margins 
if we were unable to adequately address the supply issues  we might have to reengineer some products resulting in further costs and delays 
in addition  a failure of our suppliers to maintain their viability and financial condition could result in changes in payment and other terms of our relationships and their inability to produce and deliver our products on time and in sufficient quantities 
during fiscal year  we accommodated one of our suppliers by purchasing products for inventory in advance of our contractual obligations due to the supplier s cash liquidity constraints which increased inventory and decreased cash balances 
additionally  a new domestic supplier required an advance payment of million at june   which was recorded as a prepaid expense  to fund a portion of the initial start up production quantities to a larger order 
in addition to using third party suppliers for the manufacture of our products and supply of our components  to achieve additional cost savings or operational benefits  we have expanded  and may in the future expand  our outsourcing activities where we believe a third party may be able to provide those services in a more efficient manner 
in fiscal year  we entered into an agreement with a company located in india under which they provide software development services to us 
to the extent that we rely on partners or third party service providers for the provision of software development services and key business process functions  we may incur increased business continuity risks 
we may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of software development and the development  support or maintenance of operations and processes  including the internal controls associated with our business operations and processes  which could adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy  we may not realize cost structure efficiencies and our operating and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if our third party service providers experience business difficulties or are unable to provide the services as anticipated  we may need to seek alternative service providers or resume providing such services internally which could be costly and time consuming and have an adverse material effect on our operating and financial results 

back to index if we are unable to continue generating substantial revenues from international sales and effectively managing our international operations our business could be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from international sales primarily in europe  middle east and africa emea 
our emea activities accounted for approximately of revenues for the fiscal year 
in addition  a portion of our operations consists of manufacturing  software and product development  and sales activities outside of the us our ability to sell our products and conduct our operations internationally is subject to a number of risks 
general economic and political conditions in each country could adversely affect demand for our products and services in these markets 
we may also experience reduced intellectual property and contract rights protection as a result of different business practices in certain countries  which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 
although most of our international sales are denominated in us dollars  currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower demand for our products or lower pricing resulting in reduced revenue and margins  as well as currency translation losses 
in addition  a weakening dollar has resulted in increased costs for our international operations  and could result in greater costs for our international operations in the future 
changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business in these jurisdictions 
we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the united states 
in many foreign countries  particularly those with developing economies  it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by united states regulations applicable to us  such as the foreign corrupt practices act  and any violations of such laws by our employees or contractors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements subject us to additional regulation and may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market  and increase our operating costs 
in addition  our future results could be adversely affected by difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations  which have significantly expanded and become more complex as a result of the european acquisitions completed in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year because we rely on distributors and ibm and lenovo to sell our products  our revenues could be negatively impacted if these companies do not continue to purchase products from us 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract or retain distributors to market our products effectively or provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
none of our current distributors  including ibm  is obligated to continue selling our products or to sell our new products 
we cannot be certain that any distributors will continue to represent our products or that our distributors will devote a sufficient amount of effort and resources to selling our products in their territories 
we need to expand our indirect sales channels  and if we fail to do so  our growth could be limited 
a number of our distributors in turn distribute via their own networks of channel partners with whom we have no direct relationship 
our distribution channel could be affected by disruptions in the relationships of and with our channel partners and and their networks 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales made directly to ibm  and  going forward to lenovo  and through our other distributors 
a significant portion of our other revenue is derived from sales to resellers 
if our distributors were to discontinue sales of our products or reduce their sales efforts  it could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  there can be no assurance as to the continued viability and financial condition of our distributors 
as a result of our alliance with ibm and lenovo  we rely on the parties for distribution of our products to their customers 
sales directly to ibm accounted for of our net sales during fiscal ibm and lenovo are under no obligation to continue to actively market our products 
in addition to our direct sales to ibm and lenovo  ibm and lenovo can purchase our products through individual distributors and or resellers 
furthermore  ibm can influence an end user s decisions to purchase our products even though the end user may not purchase our products through ibm 
while it is difficult to quantify the net revenues associated with these purchases we believe that these sales could be significant and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 

back to index our business may suffer if it is alleged or found that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others 
in the course of our business  third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights 
we evaluate the validity of the claims and determine whether we will negotiate licenses to use the technology 
even if we believe that the claims are without merit  responding to such claims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
there is no assurance  in the event of such claims  that we would be able to enter into a licensing arrangement on acceptable terms or that litigation would not occur 
in the event that there were a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products  or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party  and we failed to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  certain products or technologies developed by us  including for example the linux based products  may incorporate so called open source software 
open source software is typically licensed for use at no initial charge  but certain open source software licenses impose on the licensee of the applicable open source software certain requirements to license or make available to others both the open source software as well as the software that relates to  or interacts with  the open source software 
our ability to commercialize products or technologies incorporating open source software may be restricted as a result of using such open source software because  among other reasons open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in being subject to unanticipated obligations regarding our products and technologies  competitors may have improved access to information that may help them develop competitive products  open source software cannot be protected under trade secret law  and it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the origin of the open source code and whether the open source software in fact infringes third party intellectual property rights 
thin client appliance products  like personal computers  are subject to rapid technological change due to changing operating system software and network hardware and software configurations  and our products could be rendered obsolete by new technologies 
the pc market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
our products could be rendered obsolete if products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge 
we may not be able to preserve the value of our products intellectual property because we do not have any patents and other vendors could challenge our other intellectual property rights 
our products are differentiated from those of our competitors by our internally developed technology that is incorporated into our products 
we rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries  and agreements with our employees  customers  suppliers and other parties  to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights 
however  any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  which could result in costly product redesign efforts  discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm 
further  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
therefore  in certain jurisdictions in which we operate or in which we have outsourced operations we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position and cause us to incur substantial legal fees 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  other vendors could sell products with features similar to ours  and this could reduce demand for our products  which would harm our operating results 

back to index we may repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries  which could result in additional income taxes that could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  if foreign countries currency policies limit our ability to repatriate the needed funds  our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
one or more of our foreign subsidiaries may hold a portion of our cash and cash equivalents 
if we need additional cash to acquire assets or technology  or to support our operations in the united states  and if the currency policies of these foreign countries allow us  we may repatriate some of our cash from these foreign subsidiaries to the united states 
depending on our financial results and the financial results of our subsidiaries at the time that the cash is repatriated  we may incur additional income taxes from the repatriation  which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  if the currency policies of these foreign countries prohibit or limit our ability to repatriate the needed funds  our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future earnings 
the european union eu has adopted two directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment sold in the eu 
the first of these is the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive  which directs eu member states to enact laws  regulations and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electrical and electronic equipment are financially responsible for specified collection  recycling  treatment  and environmentally sound disposal of products placed on the market after august   and from products in use prior to that date that are being replaced 
the eu has also adopted the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive 
the rohs directive restricts the use of lead  mercury  and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on the market in the european union after july  we are currently evaluating the impact of these directives 
similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other areas  including in the united states  the cumulative impact of which could be significant if we are unable to recover these costs in the price of our products 
we may not be able to attract software developers to bundle their products with our thin client appliances 
our thin client appliances include our own software  plus software from other companies for specific markets 
if we are unable to attract software developers  and are unable to include their software in our products  we may not be able to offer our thin client appliances for certain important target markets  and our financial results will suffer 
in order to continue to grow our revenues  we may need to hire additional personnel 
in order to continue to develop and market our line of thin client appliances  we may need to hire additional personnel 
competition for employees is significant and we may experience difficulty in attracting qualified people 
future growth that we may experience will place a significant strain on our management  systems and resources 
to manage the anticipated growth of our operations  we may be required to improve existing and implement new operational  financial and management information controls  reporting systems and procedures  hire  train and manage additional qualified personnel  and establish relationships with additional suppliers and partners while maintaining our existing relationships 
we rely on the services of certain key personnel  and those persons knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
our products  technologies and operations are complex and we are substantially dependent upon the continued service of our existing personnel 
the loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business and profits and slow our product development processes 
except for our chairman and ceo  we generally do not have employment agreements with our key employees 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 

back to index recent and proposed regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel and affect our operating results 
we have historically used stock options as a key component of our employee compensation program 
we believe that stock options and other long term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long term stockholder value  and  through the use of vesting  encourage employee retention and allow us to provide competitive compensation packages  although in recent periods many of our employee stock options have had exercise prices in excess of our stock price  which could affect our ability to retain or attract present and prospective employees 
the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first annual period beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal and expect that it will have a material impact on our financial statements in addition  new regulations implemented by the nasdaq national market requiring stockholder approval for all stock option plans  as well as new regulations implemented by the new york stock exchange prohibiting nyse member organizations from voting on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions  could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
as a result of these new regulations  it may be more difficult or expensive for us to grant options to employees  we will incur increased cash compensation costs  and we may change our equity compensation strategy  which may make it more difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
in the event we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls over financial reporting  or if these internal controls are not effective  our business and financial results may suffer 
the sarbanes oxley act of and newly enacted rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the national association of securities dealers impose new duties on us and our executives  directors  attorneys and independent registered public accountants 
in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and such new rules and regulations  we have recently completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls over financial reporting 
as a result  we have incurred additional expenses and diversion of management s time  which has materially increased our operating expenses and accordingly reduced our net income 
while our evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of june  our internal controls over financial reporting were effective  we cannot be certain as to the outcome of our testing in future periods 
if our independent registered public accounting firm are not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented  designed  operated or reviewed  or if our independent registered public accounting firm s interpretation of the requirements  rules or regulations are different than ours in the future  then they may decline to attest to management s assessment or issue an adverse opinion on management s assessment and or our internal controls over financial reporting 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our shares 
we license our teemtalk and mangrove software to other thin client providers who may choose to license alternative products from other suppliers who are not their competitors 
we license our teemtalk and mangrove software to certain of our competitors  including wyse technology  hewlett packard and vxl 
although it is our strategy to continue to generate sales of this software by licensing it to other thin client vendors  these vendors may seek alternative products from suppliers who are not their direct competitors 
if we were to lose one or more of these customers  our revenue and profits would decline 
errors in our products could harm our business and our operating results 
because our software and thin client appliance products are complex  they could contain errors or bugs that can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
although many of these errors may prove to be immaterial  any of these errors could be significant 
detection of any significant errors may result in 
back to index the loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased maintenance and warranty costs 
these problems could harm our business and future operating results 
occasionally  we have warranted that our products will operate in accordance with specified customer requirements 
if our products fail to conform to these specifications  customers could demand a refund for the purchase price or assert claims for damages 
moreover  because our products are used in connection with critical distributed computing systems services  we may receive significant liability claims if our products do not work properly 
our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
however  these limitations may not preclude all potential claims 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
any such claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and our business 
if our contracts with citrix and other vendors of software applications were terminated  our it services business would be materially adversely affected 
we depend on third party suppliers to provide us with key software applications in connection with our it services business 
if such contracts and relationships were terminated  our revenues would be negatively affected 
our stock price can be volatile 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  can be volatile 
for example  our stock price can be affected by many factors such as quarterly increases or decreases in our revenues or earnings  changes in revenues or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  speculation in the investment community about our financial condition or results of operations and changes in revenue or earnings estimates  announcement of new products  technological developments  alliances  acquisitions or divestitures by us or one of our competitors or the loss of key management personnel 
in addition  general macroeconomic and market conditions unrelated to our financial performance may also affect our stock price 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of your shares 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
the issuance of additional equity securities may have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders and could lead to a decline in the price of our common stock 
any additional issuance of equity securities  including for acquisitions  may have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders 
in addition  the perceived risk associated with the possible sale of a large number of shares could cause some of our stockholders to sell their stock  thus causing the price of our stock to decline 
subsequent sales of our common stock in the open market or the private placement of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock could also have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares 
if our stock price declines  it may be more difficult or we may be unable to raise additional capital

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we earn interest income from our balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this interest income is subject to market risk related to changes in interest rates which primarily affects our investment portfolio 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
as of june  and  cash equivalents and short term investments consisted primarily of corporate notes and government securities  certificates of deposit  auction rate securities and other specific money market instruments of similar liquidity and credit quality 
due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
we have operations in the united kingdom  germany  france  austria  sweden and australia that are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of the foreign entities statements of operations from local currencies to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results
