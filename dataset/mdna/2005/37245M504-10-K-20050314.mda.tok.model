item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in february  genta has devoted its principal efforts toward drug discovery and research and development 
genta s strategy is to build a product and technology portfolio primarily focused on its cancer related products 
genta has been unprofitable to date and expects to incur substantial operating losses due to continued requirements for ongoing and planned research and development activities  pre clinical and clinical testing  manufacturing activities  regulatory activities and establishment of a sales and marketing organization 
from our inception to december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million 
we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we expect that these fluctuations in revenues  expenses and losses will continue 
our financial results in have been and will continue to be significantly affected by fda action with respect to genasense 
in late we filed a nda for genasense to be used in combination with dacarbazine for the treatment of patients with melanoma who have not previously received chemotherapy 
in the absence of increased survival  the fda oncology drugs advisory committee voted that the evidence presented did not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness  as measured by response rate and progression free survival  to outweigh the increased toxicity of administering genasense for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma who have not received prior chemotherapy 
on may  the company announced that it had withdrawn its nda 
on the same day  the company initiated a series of steps that were designed to conserve cash in order to focus on genasense 
the company reduced its workforce by employees  or approximately  including its field sales employees 
the company also significantly reduced its marketing support of ganite  its only marketed product 
in august  genta closed its research facility in salt lake city  utah  with a further reduction of employees 
in november  the company reported results from a randomized phase clinical trial of genasense in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll 
two hundred forty one patients were randomized to receive standard chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with or without genasense 
the primary objective of the study was to evaluate whether the addition of genasense would increase the proportion of patients who attained major objective responses defined as complete remission or a nodular partial remission  as determined by review of clinical data and bone marrow biopsies using experts who were blinded as to treatment assignment 
analysis of study results has shown that the addition of genasense to chemotherapy was associated with a statistically significant increase in the major objective response rate compared with the rate observed in patients who were treated with chemotherapy alone 
a significant increase in disease free survival was also observed 
no difference was observed in overall response rate  time to disease progression  or overall survival 
the incidence of certain serious adverse reactions  including but not limited to nausea  fever and catheter related complications  was increased in patients treated with genasense 
adverse events irrespective of relation to study drugs during treatment or within days from last dose of treatment that resulted in death occurred in patients treated with genasense plus chemotherapy compared with patients treated with chemotherapy alone 
the percentage of patients who experienced serious adverse events was increased in the genasense arm  however  the percentages of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events were equal in the treatment arms 
in november  genta reported that the company s randomized phase clinical trial of genasense in patients with multiple myeloma did not meet its primary endpoint 
the trial had been designed to evaluate whether the addition of genasense to standard therapy with high dose dexamethasone could increase the time to development of progressive disease in patients who previously had received extensive therapy 
as a result of the outcome of the phase trial  the company has virtually eliminated activities on this indication 
a significant source of funds during the last several years has been provided by the company s collaboration with aventis  regarding the development and commercialization of genasense 
the key financial aspects of the collaborative agreement were the following aventis committed to provide up to million in initial payments  milestone payments and for the purchase from us of equity and convertible notes 
if genasense received marketing approval from the fda  we would have been entitled to royalties on aventis exclusive worldwide net sales of genasense 
aventis agreed to pay of the development costs related to any us nda incurred by either us or aventis subsequent to the execution of our collaborative agreement  and substantially all other development  marketing  and sales costs incurred worldwide 
aventis agreed to reimburse a portion of our expenses in building our sales force to market in the united states 
on november  the company received from aventis notice of termination of the agreements between genta and aventis 
pursuant to those agreements  aventis will continue to support the development of genasense for a six month period lasting until may  results of operations summary operating results for the years ended december  thousands increase decrease increase decrease revenues license fees and royalties    development funding      product sales net    total revenues      cost of goods sold provision for excess inventory   total cost of goods sold   gross margin      costs and expenses research and development including non cash compensation expense related to certain stock options issued in and of  and for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively     selling  general and administrative including non cash compensation expense related to certain stock options issued in and of  and for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively    loss on disposition of equipment   total costs and expenses gross    less aventis reimbursement     total costs and expenses net     gain on extinguishment of debt   other expense income  loss before income taxes     income tax benefit expense net loss      total revenues total revenues  consisting of license fees  development funding and product sales were million in compared to million in and million in license fees and development funding revenues are generated by the initial million licensing fee and million development funding received from aventis in under the collaborative agreement see note to our financial statements  along with non exclusive sub license agreements involving antisense technology 
on november  aventis gave notice to genta that it was terminating its collaborative agreement with the company regarding the development and commercialization of genasense 
under the terms of the collaborative agreement  aventis will continue to fund ongoing development activities through may  the company had previously determined that  due to the nature of the ongoing development work related to the collaborative agreement  the end of the development phase and the fair value of the undelivered elements were not determinable 
accordingly  we deferred recognition of the initial licensing fee and up front development funding received from aventis and recognized these payments on a straight line basis over the original estimated useful life of the related first to expire patent of months 
as a result of the notice of termination of the collaborative agreement  the company has determined that the period over which the remaining deferred revenue should be recognized will be through may  on november  we began to recognize the remaining deferred revenue over a six month period  resulting in increased revenue of million for in october  the company launched the commercial product ganite for the treatment of cancer related hypercalcemia that is resistant to hydration  generating million in product sales in in may  the company eliminated its sales force and significantly reduced its marketing support for ganite 
after evaluating various options  we decided during the third quarter of to continue selective marketing support of the product 
in december  a wholesaler contacted the company to return a significant portion of its inventory of ganite 
the company agreed to the return of this product and recorded a provision for sales returns  as well as provided for potential returns from other wholesalers 
our provision for sales returns increased by million in  resulting in net sales of 
million for total revenues for of million increased million from the prior year period 
as we entered into the collaborative agreement in april  annual results included the recognition of eight months of license fee and development funding revenue received from aventis  while annual results included the recognition of twelve months of revenue 
in october  the company launched ganite  generating million in product sales 
cost of goods sold during we recorded provisions for excess ganite inventory of million 
research and development expenses research and development expenses before reimbursement were million in compared to million in and million in approximately million or of research and development expenses before reimbursement were incurred on the genasense project for the twelve months ended december  research and development expenses in include million related to the expensing of vialed genasense product and genasense bulk drug substance  much of which had been originally produced and acquired to be commercial inventory and other expenses related to the manufacturing and purchase of genasense bulk drug substance 
research and development expenses in include a million write off of acquired in process research and development resulting from the august acquisition of salus therapeutics  inc in august  genta completed the closure of its research facility in salt lake city  which had originated from the acquisition of salus therapeutics  inc excluding these items  research and development expenses declined million in  primarily resulting from our decision in may to reduce staff and reduce most non genasense related programs  as well as from the comparison to a prior year period where expenses were significantly higher resulting from genasense phase clinical trials and nda preparation activities 
research and development expenses incurred on the genasense project in were approximately million  representing of research and development expenses after excluding the write off of acquired in process research and development expenses 
during  we purchased substantial amounts of drug substance to be used in genasense phase clinical trials  leading to higher research and development expenses 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete projects in development are not reasonably estimable 
results from clinical trials may not be favorable 
data from clinical trials are subject to varying interpretation and may be deemed insufficient by the regulatory bodies reviewing applications for marketing approvals 
as such  clinical development and regulatory programs are subject to risks and changes that may significantly impact cost projections and timelines 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in in  a higher rate of spending in the first half of the year  in anticipation of approval and launch of genasense  was more than offset by the impact of the may elimination of the sales force  reduction of other administrative positions and substantial reduction of marketing support for ganite 
this net decrease was partially offset by the recognition of million of legal expenses related to a shareholder class action suit and three shareholder derivative suits see note to our financial statements 
during  expenses substantially increased from due to the creation of a sales force  ganite launch activities  a larger administrative staff and higher general corporate expenses driven by business growth 
loss on disposition of property and equipment in august  we completed the closure of our research facility in salt lake city  sold all related equipment and assigned our lease on the facility to another company 
additionally  we disposed of excess equipment at corporate headquarters 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a loss on disposition of property and equipment of approximately million

in  million of reimbursement due to genta was applied to the balance of the line of credit 
net expense reimbursement from aventis of million for the year ended december  increased from million for the year ended december  due to the following factors the comparison of twelve months of activity in compared to eight months in  greater activity and expenses resulting from the nda filing for genasense and reimbursement for and drug substance purchases used in phase clinical trials

income tax benefit expense new jersey has enacted legislation permitting certain corporations located in new jersey to sell state tax loss carryforwards and state research and development credits 
during  new jersey allowed the company to sell million of its net operating loss carryforwards and we received million from the sale  which we recognized as income tax benefit 
if still available under new jersey law  the company will attempt to sell its tax loss carryforwards in we cannot be assured that the new jersey program will continue next year  nor can we estimate what percentage of our saleable tax benefits new jersey will permit us to sell  how much money will be received in connection with the sale  or if the company will be able to find a buyer for its tax benefits 
net loss genta incurred a net loss of million  or per share  for  million  or per share  for and a net loss of million  or per share  for in  the improvement in net loss and per share net loss to common shareholders was primarily due to accelerated recognition of the initial licensing fee and up front development funding previously received from aventis and the gain on extinguishment of debt as described above

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates are most significant in connection with our critical accounting policies  namely those of our accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following represent its critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
our policy is to recognize revenues under license arrangements when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalties are recognized when earned 
consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  initial funding of ongoing development received from aventis  after the achievement of certain research and development milestones were being recognized on a straight line basis over the original estimated useful life of the related first to expire patent of months 
on november  we received from aventis notice of termination of the agreements between genta and aventis  with an effective termination date of may  accordingly  we are recognizing the remaining balance of the initial funding on a straight line basis over the time period from november  through may  see note to our financial statements 
genta recognizes revenue from product sales when title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer and we are reasonably assured of collecting payment for the sale 
all revenue from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for returns  rebates and other applicable discounts and allowances 
we allow return of our product for up to twelve months after product expiration 
in may the company eliminated its sales force and significantly reduced its marketing support for ganite 
after evaluating various options  we decided during the third quarter of to continue selective marketing support of the product 
in december  a wholesaler contacted the company to return a significant portion of its inventory of ganite 
the company agreed to the return of this product and recorded a provision for sales returns  as well as provided for potential returns from other wholesalers 
our provision for sales returns increased by million in research and development costs 
all such costs are expensed as incurred  including raw material costs required to manufacture drugs for clinical trials 
reimbursements for applicable genasense related costs under the collaborative agreement  will continue to be recorded as a reduction to expense see note to our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million  a decline of million from million at december  during cash flow used in operating activities was million  primarily resulting from a net loss of million and non cash reimbursements of research and development expenses of million 
partially offsetting this outflow  in december we raised million  net of issuance costs  from the issuance of common stock 
although no assurances can be expressed  management believes that at the current rate of spending  the company should have sufficient cash funds to maintain its present operations through at december   the company had million outstanding compared to million as of december  on the line of credit from aventis 
prior to june  the line of credit was classified as long term debt and beginning june   it was classified as short term debt 
during  as a result of certain non cash transactions  the company reduced amounts owed under the line of credit by million 
as a result of aventis purchase commitments to genta  in september we supplied million of vialed genasense drug product and genasense bulk drug substance to aventis 
this amount is included in the company s consolidated statement of operations as aventis reimbursement 
the companies agreed to offset amounts owed under the line of credit by million and accrued interest on the line of credit by million 
with the aventis notice of termination  genta cannot borrow additional funds and the line of credit must be repaid no later than may  all payments otherwise due to genta are applied against any balance on the line of credit until the line of credit is repaid 
in  million of reimbursement due to genta was applied to the balance of the line of credit 
under the terms of the collaborative agreement  aventis will continue to reimburse genta for ongoing genasense clinical trials and development activities during the six month notice period 
we expect that a substantial portion of the million outstanding on the line of credit will be repaid through the application of reimbursements 
after may   all genasense costs will be the responsibility of genta 
the terms of the line of credit provide for a favorable interest rate  which is set two days prior to the first day of each calendar quarter 
as security for the repayment of the line of credit  genta has granted aventis a security interest in all of its rights to payments under the collaborative agreement  as well as all inventory related to genasense 
at december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million declined million from million at december  during  cash flow used in operating activities was million  primarily resulting from a net loss of million and lower accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
partially offsetting this outflow were borrowings under the line of credit from aventis of million 
at december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million increased million from million at december  during  cash flow used in operating activities was million  primarily resulting from a net loss of million offset by the initial million licensing fee and million development funding received from aventis under our collaborative agreement in the company had proceeds of million from a private placement of common stock and million from the sale of convertible debt to aventis 
our principal expenditures relate to our research and development activities  primarily focused on genasense  which include our ongoing and future clinical trials 
we expect these expenditures to continue 
the company currently anticipates total company average monthly cash outflows to be in the million to million range 
although no assurances can be expressed  management believes that at the current rate of spending  the company should have sufficient cash funds to maintain its present operations through the company may also seek collaborative agreements and other financing arrangements with potential corporate partners and other sources 
however  there can be no assurance that any such collaborative agreements or other sources of funding will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
the company will need substantial additional funds before it can expect to realize significant product revenue 
if we obtain nda approval of genasense we anticipate seeking additional product development opportunities through potential acquisitions or investments 
such acquisitions or investments may consume cash reserves or require additional cash or equity 
our working capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including i the progress of our research and development programs  ii the timing and results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials  iii the level of resources that we devote to sales and marketing capabilities  iv technological advances  v the activities of competitors  vi our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others to fund certain research and development efforts  to conduct clinical trials  to obtain regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  to manufacture and market products and vii legal costs and the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings 
contractual obligations future contractual obligations at december  are as follows thousands total less than year years years more than years short term debt obligation   operating lease obligations     total     consists of amounts under our line of credit with aventis which are due on may  not included in the above table are any genasense bulk drug purchase obligations to avecia per the terms of the manufacturing and supply agreement entered into between avecia and genta in december the agreement calls for genta to purchase a percentage of our global genasense bulk drug requirements from avecia during the term of the agreement 
due to the uncertainties regarding the timing of any genasense approval and sales volume projections  specific obligation amounts cannot be estimated at this time 
due to past purchases of genasense bulk drug substance  the company has access to sufficient drug for its current needs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our carrying values of cash  marketable securities  accounts payable  accrued expenses and debt are a reasonable approximation of their fair value 
the estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies see note to our financial statements 
we have not entered into and do not expect to enter into  financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
we do not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments 
genta s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  which would impact interest income earned on such instruments 
we have no material currency exchange or interest rate risk exposure as of december  therefore there will be no ongoing exposure to material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation for sensitivity to changes in interest rates or to changes in currency exchange rates
