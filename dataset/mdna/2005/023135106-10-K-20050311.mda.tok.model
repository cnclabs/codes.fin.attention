overview our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers of our global websites 
the products offered on our websites include products we have purchased from distributors  publishers  and manufacturers and products offered by third parties on our websites 
generally  we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third parties 
our financial focus is on long term  sustainable growth in free cash flow free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures 
increases in operating income result from increases in sales through our websites and a focus on keeping our operating costs low  offset by investments we make in longer term strategic initiatives including hiring additional software engineers and computer scientists 
to increase sales  we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience  including lowering prices  improving availability  increasing selection  expanding product information  improving ease of use  and earning customer trust 
our price reductions take several forms we reduce the sales prices of products we sell  we recruit third party sellers to compete with us on product detail pages  and we reduce or eliminate the cost of shipping to the consumer 
we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes  such as financings and aligning employee interests with shareholders 
we moved to restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation in late because we believe they better align the interests of our shareholders and employees 
restricted stock units result in charges to our income statement based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date recorded over the underlying service periods 
total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were million at december   compared with million at december  and we seek to leverage our fixed customer experience costs and work to reduce our variable costs per unit 
our customer experience costs  specifically the costs necessary to build  enhance  and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers  are largely fixed in that they do not vary directly with sales 
the customer experience costs that remain variable as a percentage of sales include product costs  credit card processing fees  bad debt  picking  packaging  and preparing orders for shipment  transportation  customer service support  and most aspects of our marketing costs 
to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers  we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing  seek to maximize volume discounts available to us from suppliers  and focus on maintaining a lean culture  including by reducing defects in our processes 
free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets  including capitalized internal use software and website development  both of which are presented on our statements of cash flows 

table of contents because we are able to turn our inventory quickly  we have a negative operating cycle that is a source of cash flow on average  our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due 
inventory turnover was   for   and we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors  including our product mix  our mix of third party sales  our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability  our future investment in new geographies and product lines  and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers 
accounts payable days were   and for  and we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since it is affected by several factors  including the mix of product sales  the mix of third party sales  the mix of suppliers  and changes in payment terms over time  including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms 
our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency and enhance the customer experience on our websites 
we believe that advances in technology  specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power  the improved consumer experience of the internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broadband service to the home  and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people s lives 
our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology 
our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results  including trends 
for example  our total revenue  profit  and operating and free cash flow have recently benefited significantly from weakness in the us dollar in comparison to the currencies of our internationally focused websites 
while we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders  it is important to also evaluate our growth rates before the effect of currency changes 
for example  while our revenues increased during in comparison with the prior year  holding currency exchange constant with the prior year our growth would have been 
in the future  this trend may reverse  and our consolidated us dollar revenue growth rates would be less than our local currency growth rates 
we may have significant variation in our future reported results 
we believe that our reported net income for should not be viewed  on its own  as a material positive event  and the year over year increase in net income of million is not necessarily predictive of our future results for a variety of reasons 
for example  in we had a primarily non cash net benefit from income taxes of million resulting primarily from changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to continuing operations 
additionally  the remeasurement of our premium adjustable convertible securities peacs and intercompany balances resulted in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates 
accordingly  we encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate the effect on our operating trends of these items since future income taxes and changes in currency exchange rates may create significant variability in our future operating results
