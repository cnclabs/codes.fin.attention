item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview dmc s consolidated sales for the year ended december  increased by from those in due to a general strengthening in demand for clad metal plate manufactured by our explosion welding group 
explosive metalworking group sales increased by from to and include sales increases of and by the group s us clad metal division and nobelclad  respectively 
consolidated income from operations increased by to  in from  in due to a significant year to year improvement in the operating results of the explosive metalworking group that was partially offset by a decline in operating income at amk welding 
we reported consolidated net income of  in as compared to a net loss of  in our reported net income was reduced by a loss from discontinued operations of  relating to the divestiture of our spin forge division that was completed on september  in  we reported a loss from discontinued operations of  that reflected the combined after tax operating losses of spin forge and the former pmp division  which was sold on october  after tax income from continuing operations increased to  in from  in our explosive metalworking group reported sales of  in versus sales of  and an increase in operating income to  in from  in the outlook for continued improvement in the group s sales performance and operating income for the full year is promising 
the explosive metalworking group s backlog  which had increased from million at december  to million at december  and million as of september   increased further to million as of december  this record backlog is the direct result of the strong flow of new orders during that exceeded our expectations and that included an order in excess of million for the ravensthorpe nickel project in australia  the majority of which shipped during with the exception of the large nickel hydrometallurgy project orders that we receive periodically  us demand for our clad metal products is largely driven by plant maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing  petrochemical processing and oil refining facilities 
postponed capital spending within these industries over the past few years  improved economic conditions and the clean fuels act appear to be working together to increase demand for our products in the us in contrast to the us market  demand for our clad products in europe is more dependent on large projects  such as the building of new purified terephthalic acid pta plants in different parts of the world  including china  and on sales of electrical transition joints that are used in the aluminum smelting industry 
european sales were strong in as nobelclad shipped product relating to orders in support of new pta plant construction and other large projects  including those being constructed in china  and continued to gain market share in the electrical transition joint business 
with a record backlog at the end of and what appear to be generally strong market conditions in most of the industries that we serve  the prospects for continued sales and operating income growth in our core explosive metalworking business during are encouraging 
historically  our aerospace group has been comprised of the amk welding  spin forge and pmp divisions 
since pmp and spin forge are now reported as discontinued operations due to the sale of pmp and the divestiture of spin forge in september  the aerospace group no longer exists and amk welding has been reported as a stand alone business segment in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   amk welding reported sales of  compared to sales of  in as a result of changes in product mix and increased operating expenses  amk welding reported operating income of  in compared to operating income of  in development work performed in on a new ground based turbine did not recur during and the absence of such work in is largely responsible for the decline in amk welding s operating income levels 
after an expected slow first quarter  prospects at amk welding for and beyond appear to be quite good as the new ground based turbine goes into production and the demand for commercial aircraft engines  which has been depressed since  continues to improve 
amk welding sales in are expected to exceed those of when amk welding reported sales of approximately million and operating income in excess of million 
for the years ended december     dmc generated cash flow from operations of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
with respect to the operating cash flow generated in  approximately million was used for capital expenditures and approximately million was used for scheduled principal payments under various long term debt obligations 
increases in our net working capital and the funding of operating losses incurred by our spin forge division required us to increase our bank line of credit borrowings by approximately million in with the expected improvement in sales and operating income and an anticipated stabilization of working capital levels  operating cash flow for should be strong 
a significant portion of the operating cash flow that we expect to generate in will be used to satisfy approximately million in principal payments that are due in under various long term debt agreements and to fund approximately million in planned capital expenditures at our us clad metal  nobleclad and amk welding operations  which will allow dmc to more effectively pursue new growth opportunities 
with the reductions to existing term debt that are scheduled to occur in  outstanding obligations under existing long term debt agreements will be reduced to approximately million by the end of from approximately million at the end of minimum annual principal payments on existing term debt will be less than  in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for increased to  from  in sales by our explosive metalworking group  which include explosion bonding of clad metal and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds  increased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the explosive metalworking sales increase reflects a increase in us clad sales and a smaller us dollar sales increase at nobleclad europe 
the noblelclad europe sales increase of approximately million includes a sales volume increase of approximately million and a favorable foreign exchange translation adjustment of approximately million relating to the decline in the value of the us dollar against the euro 
the large year to year increase in worldwide explosive metalworking welding group sales is principally attributable to the improved economic condition of the industries that the group serves as evidenced by an increase in backlog from million at december  to million as of december  amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
the relatively flat sales at amk welding were expected as amk waits for a customer to transition a new ground based turbine system from development into production 
gross profit 
gross profit for increased by to  from  in our consolidated gross profit margin rate of was the same as that for the gross profit margin for our explosive metalworking group increased from in to in  while the gross profit margin for amk welding decreased to in from in the gross margin increase for our explosive metalworking group reflects a small decrease in the us gross margin rate from in to in that was more than offset by an increase in the nobelclad s rate to in from in the gross margin decline at amk welding is principally attributable to unfavorable changes in product mix as higher development work performed in on a customer s new ground turbine did not recur at the same volume levels in and was replaced by lower margin aircraft engine work 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in the increase in general and administrative expense includes an approximate  increase in incentive compensation expense resulting from the large increase in pre tax earnings  increased tax consulting expenses of approximately  relating to special tax studies that were performed during to maximize our use of available us federal income tax credits and deductions  and an increase of approximately  in aggregate audit  legal and board of director fees that relates principally to the direct and indirect costs of complying with various aspects of the sarbanes oxley act 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in this decreased percentage is attributable to the significant increase in net sales 
selling expense 
selling expenses increased by to  in from  in selling expenses for our us operations increased from  in to  in  with this increase being partially offset by a reduction in nobelclad s selling expense from  in to  in the increase in selling expenses for our us operations reflects an approximate  increase in accrued bonus expense associated with the higher profitability of the us clad metal division in and increased spending in on business travel and outside consultants relating to the higher level of business activity and the pursuit of new business development opportunities 
the decline in selling expenses for our european operations relates principally to a decrease in commissions paid to third party agents that represent us in certain countries 
as a result of the significant increase in net sales  selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in income from operations 
dmc reported income from operations of  in  an increase of  from the  of operating income reported in our explosive metalworking group reported income from operations of  in as compared to  in this  or increase in our explosive metalworking group operating income is largely attributable to the sales increase discussed above 
amk welding reported income from operations of  in compared to  in development work performed in on a new ground based turbine did not recur at the same levels during and the absence of such higher margin work in is largely responsible for the decline in amk welding s operating income levels 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased by to  in from  in this increase in interest expense reflects an increase in average borrowings under our us bank line of credit to support the higher level of working capital required by the significant growth in production and sales levels in that offset the reduction in our outstanding term debt from  at december  to  at the end of the increase in interest expense also reflects higher average interest rates in the us on our variable rate line of credit and term debt borrowings 
related party interest expense totaled  and  in and  respectively 
income tax provision 
dmc recorded a consolidated income tax provision of  in on income from continuing operations as compared to a consolidated income tax provision of  in the effective tax rate decreased to in from in the and income tax provisions include  and  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to foreign taxes associated with the operations of nobelclad and its swedish subsidiary nitro metall 
income tax provisions on the and earnings of nobelclad and nitro metall have been provided based upon the respective french and swedish statutory tax rates 
the tax effective rate is much lower than an expected rate of approximately as a result of the recognition of us tax benefits aggregating more than  relating to research and development tax credits  extraterritorial income exclusions and foreign tax credits 
these tax credits and income exclusions were generated from business activities and transactions that occurred in tax years prior to but were not probable and estimable until the fourth quarter of when special tax studies were completed 
the effective tax rate for was high because us taxes were provided at a rate on  of intercompany dividends received in from nobleclad 
the dividend income was eliminated in dmc s consolidated statement of operations  but us taxes were provided on such dividend income in the consolidated income tax provision without any offsetting tax credit as the recoverability of that tax credit did not meet the more likely than not test required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this increased the consolidated effective tax rate increased from an expected rate of approximately to an actual rate of income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations increased from  in to  in the increases reflects the significant improvement in sales and operating income reported by our explosive metalworking group in  as discussed above 
discontinued operations 
on october   dmc completed the sale of its pmp division 
in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we reported the loss on the sale of pmp as well as the operating losses reported by pmp in prior years as discontinued operations  net of related tax benefits 
on september   dmc completed the divestiture of its spin forge division 
under the principal divestiture agreement  dmc sold the assets of the spin forge division to a third party  excluding certain equipment and real estate which are being leased or subleased to the buyer  for a sales price of approximately  to be paid in cash according to the arrangement set forth in the divestiture agreement 
with respect to the spin forge manufacturing equipment and tooling  dmc recorded an after tax impairment loss of  based upon the difference between the current carrying value of the equipment and the present value of the future minimum equipment lease payments from the lessee plus estimated liquidation proceeds at the end of the minimum lease term 
the company holds a purchase option on the spin forge real estate that allows it to purchase the real estate for  a price that is below the real estate s recently appraised value 
the value inherent in the real estate purchase option is believed to be significant but was not considered in the calculation of the reported impairment loss on the spin forge equipment and tooling due to uncertainties surrounding its ultimate realization 
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we have reported the  and operating losses of spin forge and a loss on the divestiture  which includes the asset impairment loss discussed above and divestiture transaction costs  as discontinued operations  net of related tax benefits 
the net loss from the discontinued operations of pmp and spin forge decreased from  in to  with the net loss including a net of tax loss of  from the spin forge divestiture and the net loss including a net of tax loss of  from the sale of pmp 
discontinued operations included net of tax operating losses of  in and  in  with the entire amount relating to spin forge and the amount including net of tax operating losses from both spin forge and pmp in the amounts of  and  respectively 
net income 
the company reported a net income of  in compared to a net loss of  in net income for includes income from continuing operations of  that was partially offset by a loss from discontinued operations of  the net loss includes income from continuing operations of  that was exceeded by a loss from discontinued operations of  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for decreased to  from  in sales by our explosive metalworking group  which include explosion bonding of clad metal and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds  decreased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the explosive metalworking sales decrease reflects a decrease in us clad sales that was partially offset by a us dollar sales increase at nobleclad europe 
the noblelclad europe sales increase of approximately million includes a sales volume decrease of approximately million that was entirely offset by a favorable foreign exchange translation adjustment of approximately million due to the significant decline in the value of the us dollar against the euro 
the decrease in worldwide explosive metalworking group sales is principally attributable to more than million of shipments in support of inco s goro nickel project in new caledonia 
there were no similar large project orders and shipments in amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales  a decrease of 
amk welding reported record sales in as a result of significant revenues from welding development work on a new ground based turbine that has not yet reached the production phase 
the absence of similar development work in resulted in the year to year sales decrease at amk welding 
gross profit 
gross profit for decreased by to  from  in our consolidated gross profit margin decreased to in from in the gross profit margin for our explosive metalworking group decreased from in to in the decrease in the gross profit margin for the explosive metalworking group is principally due to the sales decrease discussed above and the resultant less favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
amk welding s gross margin declined from a record level of in to in due to the sales decrease that amk welding experienced in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in this increase in general and administrative expenses reflects increased legal  audit and board of directors expenses of aggregating approximately  associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  activities surrounding the divestiture of pmp  and amendments to the company s articles of incorporation that were offset by decreased spending in other areas 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in this increased percentage is attributable to decreased net sales and higher year to year spending levels for our us operations 
selling expense 
selling expenses increased by to  in from  in this increase in selling expenses is largely attributable to an increase in outside selling commissions associated with a large export order that nobelclad shipped during as a result of the increase in outside sales commissions and an unfavorable foreign exchange translation adjustment of approximately  nobleclad europe s selling expenses increased from  in to  in selling expenses for our us operations decreased from  in to  in due principally to a decrease in bonuses earned by the us explosive metalworking group sales team 
as a result of the decrease in net sales and higher year to year selling expenses at nobelclad  consolidated selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in income from operations 
dmc reported income from operations of  in  a decrease of  from the  of operating income reported in this year to year decrease reflects a significant decline in operating income reported by both our explosive metalworking group and amk welding 
our explosive metalworking group reported income from operations of  in as compared to  in this significant decrease in explosive metalworking operating income is largely attributable to the sales decrease discussed above  which resulted in a  decline in reported gross profit  and higher selling expenses 
as we stated at the beginning of  with no large projects like the goro nickel project on the horizon  the explosive metalworking group would likely have difficulty matching its sales and operating income performance in this proved to be the case 
amk welding reported income from operations of  in compared to  in amk welding s operating income in was less than half of that reported in as a result of the decrease in its sales 
interest expense  net 
interest expense decreased by to  in from  in this decrease relates principally to a decline in interest rates during the year but also reflects lower average borrowings 
outstanding borrowings were reduced to  at december  from  at the end of related party interest expense totaled  and  in and  respectively 
income tax provision 
dmc recorded a consolidated income tax provision of  in on income from continuing operations as compared to a consolidated income tax provision of  in the effective tax rate increased to in from in the and income tax provisions include  and  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to foreign taxes associated with the operations of nobelclad and its swedish subsidiary nitro metall 
the effective tax rate for is high because us taxes were provided at a rate on  of intercompany dividends received in from nobleclad 
the dividend income was eliminated in dmc s consolidated statement of operations  but us taxes are provided on such dividend income in the consolidated income tax provision without any offsetting tax credit as the recoverability of that tax credit does not meet the more likely than not test required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this increased the consolidated effective tax rate increased from an expected rate of approximately to an actual rate of 
income tax provisions on the and earnings of nobelclad and nitro metall have been provided based upon the respective french and swedish statutory tax rates 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle decreased from  in to  in this decrease is principally attributable to the large decrease in income from operations as discussed above and an increase in the effective tax rate from in to in discontinued operations 
on october   dmc completed the sale of its pmp division 
the sales price was  and was financed through the issuance of a promissory note payable over a year period 
the sale included the inventory and property  plant and equipment of pmp 
the loss recorded on the sale of pmp  as well as the operating losses reported by pmp in and  has been reported as discontinued operations  net of related tax benefits 
on september   dmc completed the divestiture of its spin forge division 
previously reported discontinued operations for and have been restated to include the net of tax operating losses of spin forge for these periods 
the net loss from discontinued operations increased to  in from  in  with the net loss including a  net of tax loss from the sale of pmp assets 
the net loss included net of tax operating losses of  and  from pmp and spin forge  respectively  as compared to net of tax operating losses of  and  that these divisions reported  respectively  in cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
on january   dmc adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and in early disclosed that up to the full amount of the remaining goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of pmp could be impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our evaluation of goodwill impairment at pmp and determined that the remaining goodwill in the amount of  was impaired 
accordingly  we wrote off all of the remaining pmp goodwill  less associated tax benefits of  and reported the resultant after tax loss of  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
net income 
the company recorded a net loss of  in compared to net income of  in the net loss includes income from continuing operations of  and a loss from discontinued operations of  net income for includes income from continuing operations of  that was almost entirely offset by a loss from discontinued operations of  and a loss of  related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as further described above 
liquidity and capital resources historically  dmc has obtained its operational financing from a combination of internally generated cash flow  revolving credit borrowings  various long term debt arrangements and the issuance of common stock 
on june   our stockholders approved a stock purchase agreement between dmc and snpe 
the closing of the transaction resulted in a payment from snpe of  to dmc in exchange for  shares of dmc common stock at a price of per share causing snpe to become the majority stockholder of dmc on the closing date 
an additional  cash payment was made by snpe to dmc to purchase a five year  convertible subordinated note that is convertible in whole or in part into common stock by snpe at a conversion price of per share at any time up to and including the june  maturity date 
we also borrowed  on june  under a credit facility with snpe that carried interest at the federal funds rate plus and provided for maximum borrowings of  in connection with its july  acquisition of nobelclad  dmc entered into a  term loan agreement with snpe 
the term loan bears interest at the federal funds rate plus 
commencing september  and on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter  principal payments of  are due  with a final principal payment of  being due on june  in anticipation of its acquisition by dmc  nobelclad acquired the stock of nitro metall and financed this acquisition with proceeds obtained from a term loan with a french bank in the amount of  euros  based upon the december  exchange rate 
this term loan carries interest at the euro interbank offered rate euribor plus 
annual principal payments of  euros begin on june  and are due on each anniversary date thereafter until final maturity on june  the bank has the option of demanding early repayment of any outstanding loans if groupe snpe s indirect ownership of nobelclad falls below 
nobelclad also maintains a million euro  based upon the december  exchange rate intercompany working capital line with groupe snpe under which borrowings of  were outstanding as of december  this intercompany line bears interest at euribor plus 
additionally  dmc maintains a  swedish krona line of credit with a swedish bank for its nitro metall operations 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit and the line has a variable interest rate  which was at december  in december  we obtained a  revolving line of credit with a us bank that replaced the  credit facility between dmc and snpe 
this bank line of credit is being used to finance ongoing working capital requirements of our us operations 
initial proceeds from the bank line of credit were used to repay  of borrowings that were outstanding under the credit facility with snpe 
the bank line expires on december  and carries an interest rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to a calculated borrowing base that is a function of inventory and accounts receivable balances and are secured by accounts receivable and inventories of our us operations and by new investments in property  plant and equipment with respect to us operations that are made during the term of the agreement 
as of december   borrowing availability under the line of credit was approximately million greater than the  in outstanding borrowings as of that date 
we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund working capital  debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future 
however  a significant portion of our sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis  and to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
consequently  any restriction on the availability of borrowing under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements 
dmc attempts to minimize its risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality  delivering product on time and competing favorably on the basis of price 
risks associated with the availability of funds are minimized by borrowing from multiple lenders 
the nature of dmc s business is largely insulated from the negative effects of inflation on sales and operating income because the pricing on custom orders reflects current raw material and other manufacturing costs 
the company s existing loan agreements include various covenants and restrictions  certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders  redemption of capital stock  incurrence of additional indebtedness  mortgaging  pledging or disposition of major assets and maintenance of specified financial ratios 
as of december   the company is in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of its debt agreements

highlights from the statement of cash flows for the year ended december  net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  totaled  significant sources of operating cash flow included income from continuing operations of  non cash depreciation and amortization expense of  a provision for deferred income taxes of  and  from the tax benefit related to stock options exercised during the year 
these sources of operating cash flow were partially offset by negative net changes in various components of working capital in the amount of  net negative changes in working capital included an increase in accounts receivable and inventories of  and  respectively 
these negative changes in working capital were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of  and  respectively  and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other of  the large increases in accounts receivable and inventories reflect the higher production and sales volume associated with the strong performance of our explosive metalworking business during the last half of fortunately  we were able to finance a significant portion of the build up in accounts receivable and inventories by increasing our accounts payable and accrued expenses

future capital needs and resources we anticipate that  for the foreseeable future  significant amounts of available cash flows will be utilized for operating expenses to support our domestic and foreign manufacturing operations  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  and other general corporate expenditures  including dividend payments when and if adopted by the company 
we expect cash inflows from operating activities to exceed outflows for the full year however  our success depends on the execution of our strategies  including our ability to secure an adequate level of new customer orders at all operating divisions  and continue to implement the most cost effective internal processes 
based on available cash resources  anticipated capital expenditures and projected operating cash flow  we believe that we will be able to fully fund our operations during in making this assessment  we have considered presently scheduled debt service requirements during  as well as the availability of funding related to our line of credit with snpe and our bank lines of credit  the anticipated level of capital expenditures in  and our expectation of realizing positive cash flow from operations in critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
we determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition  asset impairments  inventory valuation and impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks 
revenue recognition 
the company s contracts with its customers generally require the production and delivery of multiple units or products 
the company records revenue from its contracts using the completed contract method as products are completed and shipped to the customer 
for contracts that require multiple shipments  revenue is recorded only for the units included in each individual shipment 
if  as a contract proceeds toward completion  projected total cost on an individual contract indicates a potential loss  the company provides currently for such anticipated loss 
asset impairments 
the company reviews its long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in so doing  the company estimates the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of  if any  are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually on reporting units one level below the segment level and any impairment is based on the reporting unit s estimated fair value 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of similar businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company s policy is to test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year unless an indicator of impairment arises earlier 
the entire amount of goodwill  which had a carrying value of  on the consolidated balance sheet as of december   relates to the company s us clad metal products division 
based on the analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  no impairment was recorded to the carrying value of goodwill 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the functional currency for the company s foreign operations is the applicable local currency for each affiliate company 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated at exchange rates in effect at period end  and the statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during the period 
exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments 
cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in other cumulative comprehensive income loss 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise 
subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains and losses which are reflected in income as unrealized based on period end translations or realized upon settlement of the transactions 
cash flows from the company s operations in foreign countries are translated at actual exchange rates when known  or at the average rate for the period 
as a result  amounts related to assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows will not agree to changes in the corresponding balances in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies are reported as a separate line item below cash flows from financing activities 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement base and the tax base of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company believes that deferred tax assets will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income and as such no allowance has been recorded on the deferred tax assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  during the fourth quarter of  the company completed special tax studies related to research and development tax credits  foreign tax credits and extraterritorial income exclusions 
as a result of these tax studies  the company recognized approximately  in tax benefits in its tax provision calculation that increased its reported net income by the same amount 
the company will closely monitor the availability of similar tax benefits in the future but cannot currently estimate the amount of such tax benefits  if any  which may be realized in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no obligations  assets or liabilities other than those disclosed in the consolidated financial statements forming part of this form k  no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value  and no relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties
