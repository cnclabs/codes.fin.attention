napster is currently available in the united states  canada and the uk and is headquartered in los angeles with offices in london  new york  san diego and san jose 
until december   napster was known as roxio  inc and we operated our business in two divisions  the consumer software division csd and the online music distribution division  also known as the napster division 
on december   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of csd to sonic solutions  a california corporation sonic  including all of the capital stock of certain international subsidiaries 
sonic solutions paid a total of million in cash  subject to certain future adjustments  and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements  shares of sonic solutions common stock  valued at approximately million as of the closing date 
we intend to retain the proceeds and use them for general working capital purposes and to operate and expand our napster business 
since the sale of our consumer software division  we have focused exclusively on our online music distribution business under the napster brand and  since january   have been traded on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol naps 
the napster service allows users to legally stream  download and copy  or burn a wide variety of digital music 
napster launched the napster service in october  following the may acquisition of napster  llc f k a pressplay 
napster derives its primary revenues from online subscriptions and permanent music downloads 
the napster service offers subscribers on demand access to a wide variety of music that can be streamed or downloaded as well as the ability to purchase individual tracks or albums on an a la carte basis 
subscription and permanent download fees are paid by end user customers in advance either via credit card  online payment systems or redemption of pre paid cards  gift certificates or promotional codes 
napster also periodically licenses merchandising rights and resells hardware that our end users may utilize to store and replay their digital music content 
the online music business was launched under the napster brand in the united states in october prior to this launch we had online music revenue from the acquisition of a business  napster  llc  formerly known as pressplay 
during may  we expanded the service to be available in both the united kingdom and canada 
our online music subscription services  napster and napster to go  provide consumers with unlimited access to over  songs for monthly fees of and  respectively in the united states 
fees in other geographies are based on the local currency and vary accordingly 
with all of our products consumers can discover  access and acquire their favorite songs by searching or browsing our catalogue  or accessing preprogrammed content through radio stations or custom compilations

currently  the dell dj  dell dj  dell pocket dj  creative zen micro  creative zen pmc  gateway mp photo jukebox  iriver h  iriver h  iriver pmc  samsung yh and audiovox smt are all napster to go compatible 
if the public availability of compatible mp players is delayed  or there are not enough compatible mp players  our planned revenue growth could be adversely impacted 
we sell our online music services directly to end users through our napster 
com website  but also use retail distribution channels to promote and bundle the napster services with other products they sell 
if we lost access to our retail distribution partners  our revenues could be adversely impacted 
the market for online music is rapidly growing and we expect our online music business to continue to grow as the industry expands

additionally  our strategic priorities include continuing to build our customer brand  pursuing strategic partnerships and pursuing strategic acquisitions and complementary technologies 
the napster division continues to operate at a loss and net negative cash flow due to our significant investments to enhance service capabilities  market napster to go and grow worldwide 
discontinued operations on december   napster sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its consumer software division csd 
from the acquisition of pressplay on may  though the divestiture of csd on december   our consumer software products business accounted for substantially all of our revenues 
prior to the acquisition of pressplay  csd accounted for all of our revenues

distributors resold our consumer software products to retailers of computer software products 
we also sold our software products to oems such as pc manufacturers and cd and dvd recordable drive manufacturers and integrators 
during fiscal  we undertook a number of restructurings  particularly workforce reductions and real estate consolidations  to react to market conditions

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements  including those related to revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances  bad debt allowances  valuation and amortization of long lived assets  restructuring provisions and deferred income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
certain of our critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our significant accounting policies 
certain of these policies require substantial judgment on the part of management 
these critical accounting policies and the effect that changes in management s estimates could have on our consolidated financial statements are further described below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  emerging issues task force eitf revenue arrangements with 
table of contents 
index to financial statements multiple deliverables and eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
in general  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  the product or services have been delivered and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
music subscriptions are paid in advance  typically for monthly or annual periods 
music subscription revenues are recognized on a daily basis over the subscription period 
revenues from sales of individual songs or albums by download are recognized at the time the music is delivered  digitally  to the end user 
revenues from pre paid cards are deferred and then recognized as tracks are downloaded by the end users or  if redeemed for a subscription  over the subscription period 
revenues from licenses of napster merchandising rights are recognized upon receipt of royalty reports from the licensee 
we have arrangements whereby customers pay one price for multiple products and services 
in some cases  these arrangements involve a combination of hardware and services 
in other cases  the customer pays a single price for multiple music downloads and months of music subscriptions 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate units in accordance with eitf no 
consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values 
in the event that there is no objective and reliable evidence of fair value  the revenue recognized upon delivery is the total arrangement consideration less the fair value of the undelivered items 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
management applies significant judgment in establishing the fair value of multiple elements within revenue arrangements 
estimates of fair value represent our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to the products and services sold in these arrangements may result in one time revenue charges as future elements of the arrangements are delivered 
we have arrangements with certain customers whereby the customer provides goods or services to napster 
our revenue and the charges for the goods or services provided by a customer are accounted for in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  including subsequent interpretations eitf 
the costs of separately identifiable goods or services received from a customer are valued at the cost we would incur to procure the same goods or services from a non customer third party 
if the goods or services cannot be separated  the total consideration is recorded as a reduction of revenues 
consideration paid to customers under these arrangements that exceeds the separately identifiable value of the goods or services provided would be reflected as a reduction of the customer s revenue 
management exercises significant judgment in determining the fair value of separately identified goods or services 
estimates of fair value represent our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to the products and services sold in these arrangements may result in one time expense or revenue charges 
we recognize revenue gross or net in accordance with eitf in most arrangements  we contract directly with our end user customers  are the primary obligor and carry all collectibility risk 
revenue in these arrangements is recorded on a gross basis 
in some cases  we utilize third party distributors to sell products or services directly to end user customers and carry no collectibility risk 
in those instances  in accordance with eitf  we report the revenue net of the amount paid to the distributor

 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas 
in general  csd recognized revenue when there was persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee was fixed or determinable  the product or services had been delivered and collectibility of the resulting receivable was reasonably assured 
csd sold its consumer software products through original equipment manufacturers oems  retail channels via distributors and direct to end users 

table of contents 
index to financial statements for software product sales to oems  csd recognized revenue based on reported product shipments from oems to their customers provided that all fees were fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement existed and collectibility was reasonably assured 
for arrangements in which all elements were not delivered at the point of reported product shipment  revenues associated with the undelivered element were recognized when all revenue recognition criteria were met for the undelivered elements 
for software product sales to distributors  revenues were recognized upon product shipment to the distributors or receipt of the products by the distributor  depending on the shipping terms  provided that all fees were fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement existed and collectibility was reasonably assured 
csd s distributor arrangements provided distributors with certain product rotation rights 
additionally  csd permitted its distributors to return products in certain circumstances  generally during periods of product transition 
csd also utilized mail in rebates mirs as a marketing tool to promote its products and acquire new end users 
estimated redemption of mirs was recorded as a direct reduction to revenues and was accrued at the date the related revenues were recognized 
estimates were based upon historical redemption rates and current market factors 
for direct software product sales to end users  revenues were recognized upon shipment by csd to the end users provided all appropriate revenue recognition criteria were met 
end users additionally had the right to return their product within days of the purchase 
csd established allowances for expected product returns in accordance with sfas no 
and sab these allowances were recorded as a direct reduction of revenues and as an accrued liability 
csd had other programs whereby customers are reimbursed for promotional activities 
in accordance with eitf  the costs of separately identifiable promotions were valued at the cost csd would incur to obtain the same promotion from a non customer third party and were charged to marketing expense 
if the promotion could not be separated  the total consideration was recorded as a reduction of revenue 
revenues from csd licenses of technology were recognized upon delivery of the licenses  provided that all fees were fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement existed  and collectibility was reasonably assured and there were no undelivered elements in the arrangement 
in connection with the retail sale of csd products  csd provided to customers a limited amount of free technical support assistance including bug fixes  work arounds  patches and compatibility updates that were downloadable from the csd website 
in accordance with sop  csd did not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with this free technical support assistance but accounted for this obligation by accruing the estimated cost of providing such assistance as the associated revenue was recognized 
management exercised significant judgment in determining whether revenues were collectable  estimating mir redemption  return reserve allowances  fair value of separately identified goods or services and estimating the cost of technical support assistance 
these estimates represented our best estimate 
all csd product return  rebate and technical support obligations were assumed by sonic as of december  fair value hedge on december   napster entered into a forward contract to hedge exposures resulting from changes in fair market value of the  shares of sonic common stock received in our sale of csd to sonic the sonic shares 
this forward contract is accounted for as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires us to recognize the hedge as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet  measured at fair value 
additionally  pursuant to sfas no 
 changes in the intrinsic value of this fair value hedge are recognized as gains or losses in current operations within other income loss 
effective december   when the hedge was put in place  gains or losses on fair value changes of the hedged sonic shares are also recognized in current operations in other

index to financial statements income loss  offsetting any gain or loss on the fair value hedge 
napster will record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments as a gain or loss in current operations 
additionally  the hedge discount is recorded as an interest expense over the term of the hedge 
management exercised judgment in determining the nature of this hedge 
prepaid content advances and marketing expenses we recognize up front advance payments for digital content and marketing expenses in prepaid and other current assets 
prepaid content advances are expensed based on usage 
prepaid marketing expenses are charged to operations as we receive separately identifiable marketing services from our strategic marketing partners 
advances that are not recovered by the end of their contractual terms may be non refundable 
the recoverability of these balances is subject to regular review by management considering expected future content fees and marketing services 
the estimates of expected future benefits include judgments about growth in demand for our products  performance by our strategic partners and fair values for related services 
changes in these estimates could require us to write down the carrying value of these advances and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
capitalized software development costs internal use software 
we comply with aicpa sop no 
accounting for cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and eitf issue accounting for website development costs 
in accordance with sop  software development costs incurred as part of an approved project plan that result in additional functionality to internal use software are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software  generally three years 
software held for sale 
in accordance with sfas no 
 computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  development costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers 
we have not capitalized any software development costs as technological feasibility is generally not established until a working model is completed  at which time substantially all development is complete 
management applies significant judgment when determining whether products under development are technologically feasible or whether it is probable that they will result in additional functionality 
these judgments include assessments of our development progress and expected performance 
additionally  the future realizability of capitalized software costs is subject to regular review by management  who consider expected future benefits 
the estimates of expected future benefits include judgments about growth in demand for our products  performance by our strategic partners and fair values for related services 
changes in these estimates could require us to write down the carrying value of these capitalized amounts and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we adopted effective april  we ceased to amortize goodwill effective april  and evaluate the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis 
we will adjust the carrying value if the asset s value has been impaired 
we amortize other intangible assets on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  generally three years 
during the fourth quarters of each of fiscal  and we completed our annual impairment tests 
the assessment of goodwill impairment was conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements our reporting units  as defined in sfas  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of each date 
in fiscal we used the market value approach to determine the fair value 
in fiscal and we used the discounted cash flow methodology because we had multiple business segments 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired during fiscal  or we plan to conduct our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of every year  or sooner if impairment indicators exist 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances  including changes in market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  have occurred requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 
restructuring provisions we have recorded restructuring provisions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for exit costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in order to determine our restructuring liability  sfas requires us to make a number of assumptions 
these assumptions include estimated wages and associated costs for employee terminations  sublease income over the remaining lease period  estimated term of subleases  estimated utility and real estate broker fees  as well as estimated discount rates for use in calculating the present value of our liability 
we developed these assumptions based on our employee termination plans and understanding of the real estate market as well as market interest rates 
the assumptions used were management s best estimate at the time of the accrual  and adjustments are made on a periodic basis if better information is obtained 
on december  sonic assumed all liabilities on leases associated with our restructuring provisions 
following the csd divestiture  in december and january all terminated employees received their separation pay 
as such  there is no outstanding restructuring liability as of march  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves determining our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from various means including future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
the above process is computed separately for each of continuing operations  the discontinued operation and elements of other comprehensive income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  net of reversing deferred tax liabilities  as of march  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses and accrued liabilities and other provisions not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the timing of the reversal of the remaining deferred tax liability related to the election to step up the tax basis of the pressplay goodwill is indefinite 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

management generally estimates the fair value of non traded equity instruments using the black scholes model 
the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

we anticipate that content revenues will continue to increase in the future as the overall online music market expands  and as a result of our continued marketing activities and initiatives to control customer cancellations churn  increase customer growth and expand internationally 
hardware and license revenues increased approximately million to million in fiscal from  in fiscal  primarily due to increased hardware promotions in fiscal we anticipate that hardware and license revenues will fluctuate in the future depending on the hardware promotions and licenses that we enter into each period

gross margin on content revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to the revenue mix which transitioned to a higher percentage of subscriptions during fiscal additionally  our continuing operations have a relatively fixed cost base that was put in place in october as part of the launch of the online music service 
margins are improving steadily as revenues have grown in contrast to those fixed costs 
hardware and license gross margins fluctuate based on the nature of the hardware promotions and the volume of trademark licenses in each period 
during the year ended march   napster sponsored hardware promotions at break even and offered several product bundles 
revenue from product bundles is allocated between content revenues and hardware and license revenues on a pro rata basis in accordance with eitf no 
napster had immaterial license revenues in both fiscal and online service headcount dedicated to maintaining content and providing customer care was at march  and at march  we expect online music gross margins to increase slightly as we expand revenues  transition the revenue mix to more subscribers and maintain our fixed infrastructure base 
operating expenses we classify operating expenses as research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative 
each category includes related expenses for salaries  employee benefits  incentive compensation  travel  telephone  communications  rent and allocated facilities and professional fees 
our sales and marketing expenses include additional expenditures specific to the marketing group  such as public relations and advertising  trade shows  and marketing collateral materials and expenditures specific to the sales group  such as commissions

research and development expenses increased  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this net increase was primarily due to a million increase in research and development in fiscal  offset by million of non recurring expenses in the quarter ended december  for one time costs associated with launching the napster service in october the million increase is primarily due to a full year of research and development activity in fiscal compared to ten months of activity in fiscal following the may pressplay acquisition 
research and development headcount for napster was at march  and at march  we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to invest in online music features and services  but will remain flat or decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  and costs associated with advertising and promotions 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to million of additional advertising and promotional spending during fiscal compared to the prior year  because the napster service was not launched until the third quarter of fiscal and because we undertook an extensive marketing campaign during february and march related to the launch of napster to go 
the increase was also due to million of additional staff and overhead expenses because fiscal included a full year  whereas fiscal included only ten months from the date the acquisition of pressplay in may sales and marketing headcount for napster was at march  and at march  we anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase in the future as a result of continued marketing activities and a number of initiatives planned to drive customer growth and international expansion

the restructuring charge was primarily in connection with the reorganization of napster s domestic operations 
this restructuring charge was primarily related to severance and benefits associated with involuntary terminations

stock based compensation decreased  or to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  because most deferred charges have been fully amortized 
we expect stock based compensation charges will increase in the future because napster plans to change it s employee stock based compensation from issuing employee stock options to issuing restricted stock rights in fiscal during fiscal we will report stock based compensation equal to the fair value of stock rights granted to employees over the employee s service period

other income  net increased  in fiscal to million from  in fiscal primarily due to a million increase in investment income offset by a  increase in interest expense  a  foreign currency loss and a  expense for the discount on the fair market value hedge 
we had no foreign currency gains or losses and no hedges in fiscal we expect other income  net to increase in fiscal because we have more cash equivalents and short term investments as of march  and we have paid off the line of credit 
income tax benefit income tax benefit primarily relates to the tax benefit of utilizing the operating losses from continuing operations to offset taxable gains in the discontinued operation 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
conversely  we have recognized a provision in continuing operations in each period that a valuation allowance was recorded against beginning of the period deferred tax assets 
during january  following the divestiture of csd  which utilized substantially all of our tax operating losses  napster made a tax election to step up the basis in pressplay goodwill for tax purposes 
as a result  the pressplay goodwill is deductible for tax purposes 
in accordance with fas  this tax deduction represents a tax timing difference that is shown as a provision for income taxes 
income tax benefit increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily due to the taxable gain on the divestiture of csd during fiscal  which was completely offset by operating losses from continuing operations 
this benefit is offset by a million tax provision for the deductibility of the pressplay goodwill 
we do not expect to realize tax benefits on the continuing operations in fiscal  because the discontinued operation csd has been divested and continuing operations are expected to incur taxable losses in the foreseeable future 
we expect to incur a tax provision of approximately million during fiscal related to the deductible pressplay goodwill 
in the event that deferred tax assets are realizable in the future in excess of the net recorded valuation allowance  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will increase the tax benefit in the period such determination is made 
income loss from discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to the million after tax gain on the sale of csd in december and million of after tax profits from csd prior to the divestiture

general and administrative charges for the continuing operations in fiscal represent corporate overhead charges that are not directly attributable to csd 
general and administrative expenses increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of the addition of the online music division during early fiscal general and administrative headcount for napster was at march  and at march  general and administrative headcount in all periods includes all corporate general and administrative employees 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets consists of amortization expense related to the intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of the napster trademark in november and napster  llc  formerly known as pressplay  in may amortization of other intangible assets increased million or to million in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase is because the napster trademark was acquired during the third quarter of fiscal  and was therefore only amortized for three months in fiscal compared to twelve months in fiscal additionally  presssplay was acquired in fiscal  and therefore represented none of the fiscal amortization

stock based compensation charges relate to the amortization of costs associated with stock options issued to employees and the commitment of napster stock options to adaptec employees who became napster employees and are part of continuing operations

recent accounting pronouncements other than temporary impairment in march  the eitf reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the consensus clarified the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to debt and equity investments accounted for under sfas no 
and other investments accounted for under the cost method 
the recognition and measurement guidance for which the consensus was reached in march was originally to be applied to other than temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after june  in september  the fasb issued a final fasb staff position that delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance for all investments within the scope of eitf no 
the consensus reached in march also provided for certain disclosure requirements associated with cost method investments that were effective for fiscal years ending after june  the applicable disclosures have been included in our consolidated financial statements and related notes hereto 
we will evaluate the effect of adopting the recognition and measurement guidance when the final consensus is reached

r  share based payment  which revises the previously effective sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
 and on march  the sec issued sab  share based payment sab 
these pronouncements address the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb no 
and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
the fasb originally stated a preference for a lattice model because it believed that a lattice model more fully captures the unique characteristics of employee stock options in the estimate of fair value  as compared to the black scholes model which we currently use for our footnote disclosure 
the fasb decided to remove its explicit preference for a lattice model and to not require a particular valuation methodology 
the effective date of the proposed standard for public companies is for the first annual reporting period beginning after june  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income loss per share 
exchanges of nonmonetary assets in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb no 
 which requires nonmonetary exchanges to be recorded at the fair value of the assets exchanged  with certain exceptions 
this standard requires most exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair value  rather than at carryover basis 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and we will adopt this standard in fiscal adoption of his statement will have no material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market value risk short term investments include  shares of unregistered common stock of sonic that were received as partial consideration for the sale of csd to sonic 
napster intends to sell these shares as soon as they are registered 
on december   napster entered into a forward contract to hedge these shares against exposures resulting from changes in fair market value

the changes in fair value of the forward contract are intended to offset changes in the market value of the sonic shares

interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions and  as part of our cash management process  we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions 
amounts deposited with these institutions may exceed federal depository insurance limits 
in addition  the portfolio of investments conforms to our policy regarding concentration of investments  maximum maturity and quality of investment 
some of the securities in which we have invested may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to reduce this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  corporate bonds  us agencies securities  asset backed securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
all of our short term investments mature in less than two years 
the following table presents the amounts of our short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of march  our cash equivalents are invested in money market funds  commercial paper and municipal securities  which are not included in the table because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities in thousands  except interest rates 
maturing in total estimated fair value less than one year more than one year short term investments weighted average interest rate we have available to us a million revolving line of credit 
we had borrowed million against this line of credit as of march  the entire million  plus  of accrued interest  was paid in full during may we do not have any outstanding variable interest rate debt
