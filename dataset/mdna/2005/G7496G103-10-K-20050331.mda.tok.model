item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of the corrections are attributable to an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contract and an assignment agreement  each entered into by renaissance reinsurance with inter ocean reinsurance company  ltd 
inter ocean in in connection with the aforementioned review  the company concluded that these contracts  based on the totality of the surrounding facts and circumstances  should have been treated as a single transaction and  when so treated  lacked the necessary risk transfer to be accounted for as transactions involving ceded reinsurance and a sale of reinsurance recoverables 
the remaining restatement corrections are attributable to four multi year ceded reinsurance contracts 
the aggregate net effect of all the corrections is to increase net income by million  to decrease net income by million  and to increase net income by million

pursue additional joint venture opportunities 
building upon our relationships and expertise in modeling  underwriting and capital management  we intend to seek new joint venture and investment opportunities  which may include new partners and diversifying classes of business

increase our position in the individual risk market 
we plan to continue to expand our individual risk business by increasing the number and size of our programs and by using technology to help manage the business effectively  while keeping our infrastructure relatively small and leveraging our modeling expertise and franchise value 
we believe we are positioned to fulfill these objectives by virtue of the experience and skill of our management team  our significant financial strength  and our strong relationships with brokers and clients 
in addition  we believe our superior service  our proprietary modeling technology  and our extensive business relationships which enabled us to become a leader in the property catastrophe reinsurance market will be instrumental in allowing us to achieve our strategy 
business segments we currently conduct our business through two reportable segments  reinsurance and individual risk 
financial data relating to our two segments is included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in our consolidated financial statements and notes presented under item reinsurance segment as described above  our reinsurance operations are comprised of three components property catastrophe reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  specialty reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  and certain activities of ventures 
our portfolio of business has continued to be increasingly characterized by a number of large ceding companies with whom we do business 
accordingly  our written premiums are subject to significant fluctuations depending on our success in maintaining or expanding our relationships with these large customers 
property catastrophe reinsurance our property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are generally all risk in nature 
our most significant exposure is to losses from earthquakes and hurricanes  although we are also exposed to claims arising from other natural and man made catastrophes  such as winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  explosions  tornadoes and terror events  in connection with the coverages we provide 
our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage 
however  other risks  including business interruption and other non property losses  may also be covered under our property reinsurance contracts when arising from a covered peril 
because of the wide range of possible catastrophic events to which we are exposed  and because of the potential for multiple events to occur in the same time period  our catastrophe reinsurance business is volatile  and our results of operations may reflect this volatility 
further  our financial condition may be impacted by this volatility over time or at any point in time 
the effects of claims from one or a number of severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on us 
we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property and the effects of inflation will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
we seek to moderate the volatility described in the preceding paragraph through the use of contract terms  portfolio selection methodology  diversification and probability analyses 
also  consistent with risk management practices  we seek to purchase reinsurance protection for our own account and to effect other risk spreading transactions to seek to further reduce the potential volatility of our results 
catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance 
we write catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance  which provides coverage to primary insurers when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the attachment point specified in a particular contract 
under these contracts we indemnify an insurer for a portion of the losses on insurance policies in excess of a specified loss amount  and up to an amount per loss specified in the contract 
a portion of our property catastrophe excess of loss contracts limit coverage to one occurrence in a contract year  but most such contracts provide for coverage of a second occurrence after the payment of a reinstatement premium 
the coverage provided under excess of loss reinsurance contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance 
we enter into retrocessional contracts that provide property catastrophe coverage to other reinsurers or retrocedants 
in providing retrocessional reinsurance  we focus on property catastrophe retrocessional reinsurance which covers the retrocedant on an excess of loss basis when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril and from a multiple number of reinsureds exceed a specified attachment point 
the coverage provided under excess of loss retrocessional contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
excess retrocessional coverage is generally characterized by high volatility  principally because retrocessional contracts expose a reinsurer to an aggregation of losses from a single catastrophic event 
in addition  the information available to retrocessional underwriters concerning the original primary risk can be less precise than the information received from primary companies directly 
moreover  exposures from retrocessional business can change within a contract term as the underwriters of a retrocedant alter their book of business after retrocessional coverage has been bound 
specialty reinsurance we write a number of lines of reinsurance such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism and medical malpractice  which we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
we believe that our underwriting and analytic capabilities have positioned us well to manage and grow this business 
growth in this unit was robust in  as gross written premiums increased year on year 
potential losses from many of these coverages could be characterized as low frequency and high severity  similar to our catastrophe reinsurance coverages 
we also seek to manage the correlations of this business with our property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
the professional staff of our specialty reinsurance operations includes persons with underwriting  actuarial science and legal experience 
ventures we pursue a number of other opportunities through ventures  which has responsibility for managing our joint venture relationships  executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk and managing certain investments directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance 
our professionals have experience across a range of disciplines  including accounting  investment banking and law  as well as insurance and reinsurance 
property catastrophe oriented joint ventures 
we actively manage property catastrophe oriented joint ventures  which provide us with additional presence in the market as well as fee income 
they allow us to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on a larger capital base 
currently  our joint ventures are top layer re and davinci 
we are the exclusive underwriting manager for each of top layer re and davinci 
top layer re writes high excess non us property catastrophe reinsurance 
top layer re is owned by state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm and by renaissance reinsurance 
state farm provides billion of stop loss reinsurance coverage to top layer re 
davinci writes global reinsurance 
in general  we seek to construct for davinci a property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio with risk characteristics similar to those of renaissance reinsurance s property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
we also write certain lines of specialty reinsurance for davinci 
we owned of davinci s outstanding equity at december   but controlled a majority of its outstanding voting power  and accordingly davinci s financial results are consolidated in our financial statements 
in these joint ventures  we typically provide our partners with underwriting  claims management  risk modeling  capital and investment management services  marketing  reporting  remittances and payments processing and other services 
we work within agreed upon underwriting guidelines  tailored to our partners requirements  using the same techniques and systems for the underwriting as we apply to our own portfolio 
these relationships create fees for services and profit sharing income for ventures and renaissance reinsurance 
in turn  our joint ventures have increased the capital we can commit to the catastrophe reinsurance market and have deepened our market penetration

in addition to the gaap financial measures set forth in this form k  we have included certain non gaap financial measures in this form k within the meaning of regulation g 
we have consistently provided these financial measurements in previous filings and we believe that these measurements are important to investors and other interested parties  and that investors and other such persons benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry 
these measures may not  however  be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies outside the insurance industry 
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non gaap measures in assessing our overall financial performance 
we have included in this form k managed property catastrophe premium and managed reinsurance premium 
managed property catastrophe premium and managed reinsurance premium are defined as gross property catastrophe and gross reinsurance premium  respectively  written by renaissance reinsurance and the joint ventures 
managed property catastrophe premium and managed reinsurance premium differ from total property catastrophe premium and total reinsurance premium  respectively  which we believe are the most directly comparable gaap measures  due to the inclusion of catastrophe premium written on behalf of our joint venture top layer re which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
customized reinsurance transactions 
ventures works on a range of other customized reinsurance transactions 
for example  we have participated in the market for catastrophe linked securities 
we also offer products through which we cede participations in the performance of our catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
we believe our products contain a number of customized features designed to fit the needs of our partners  as well as our risk management goals 
business development joint ventures and other investments 
ventures also pursues other types of investments where  rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves  we instead partner with other market participants 
the results of these investments are not included in the reinsurance segment results  but instead are included in the other category of our segment results 
these investments are directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe  and at times may also be directed at non insurance risks 
we find these investments attractive both for their expected returns  and also because they provide us diversification benefits and information and exposure to other aspects of the market 
examples of these investments include

underwriting reinsurance our primary underwriting goal is to construct a portfolio of reinsurance contracts that maximizes our return on shareholders equity subject to prudent risk constraints 
we assess each new reinsurance contract on the basis of the expected incremental return relative to the incremental contribution to portfolio risk 
we have developed a proprietary  computer based pricing and exposure management system  rems 
rems was initially developed with consulting assistance from tillinghast  an actuarial consulting unit of towers  perrin  forster crosby  and applied insurance research  inc  the developer of the catmap tm system 
since inception  we have continued to invest in and improve rems  incorporating our underwriting experience  additional proprietary software and a significant amount of new industry data 
rems has analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each incremental reinsurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of reinsurance contracts 
we combine the analyses generated by rems with other information available to us  including our own knowledge of the client submitting the proposed program  to assess the premium offered against the risk of loss which the program presents 
we have licensed and integrated into rems a number of third party catastrophe computer models in addition to our base model  which we use to validate and stress test our base rems results 
while rems is most developed in analyzing catastrophe risks  it is also used for analyzing other classes of risk 
we believe that rems is a more robust underwriting and risk management system than is currently commercially available elsewhere in the reinsurance industry 
before the company binds any risk  a significant amount of exposure data is gathered from clients and this exposure data is input into the rems modeling system 
the rems modeling system enables the company to measure each policy on a consistent basis and provides the company with a measurement of an appropriate price to charge for each policy based upon the risk that is assumed 
rems combines computer generated statistical simulations that estimate event probabilities with exposure and coverage information on each client s reinsurance contract to produce expected claims for reinsurance programs submitted to us 
our models employ simulation techniques to generate  years of activity  including events causing in excess of billion in insured industry losses 
from this simulation  we generate estimates of expected claims  expected profits and a probability distribution of potential outcomes for each program in our portfolio and for our total portfolio 
rems allows us to score the contracts that we write by comparing the expected profit of a contract with the amount of capital that we allocate to the contract based on its marginal impact on the risk of our portfolio 
we have also customized rems by including additional perils  risks and geographic areas that are not captured in the commercially available models 
all of our reinsurance underwriters use rems in their pricing decisions  which we believe provides them with several competitive advantages 
these include the ability 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
to simulate a greater number of years of catastrophic event activity compared to a much smaller sample in generally available models  allowing us to analyze exposure to a greater number and combination of potential events  
spacer 
gif 

spacer

to analyze the incremental impact of an individual reinsurance contract on our overall portfolio

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
to assess risk across multiple entities including our various joint ventures and across different components of our capital structure  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
to provide consistent pricing information 
as part of our risk management process  we also use rems to assist us with the purchase of reinsurance coverage for our own account 
we have developed underwriting guidelines  to be used in conjunction with rems  that limit the exposure to claims from any single catastrophic event and the exposure to losses from a series of catastrophic events 
as part of our pricing and underwriting process  we also assess a variety of other factors  including  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
the reputation of the proposed cedant and the likelihood of establishing a long term relationship with the cedant  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
the geographic area in which the cedant does business and its market share  
spacer 
gif 

spacer

historical loss data for the cedant and  where available  for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions  in order to compare the cedant s historical catastrophe loss experience to industry averages

spacer 
gif 
the cedant s pricing strategies  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
the perceived financial strength of the cedant 
in order to define the risk profile of each line of specialty reinsurance  we establish probability distributions and assess the correlations with the rest of our portfolio 
in lines with catastrophe risk  such as excess workers compensation  we are leveraging directly off our skill in modeling for our property catastrophe reinsurance risks  and it is important to understand the correlations between these specialty lines and our catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
for other classes of business  which have little or no natural catastrophe exposure  and hence have significantly less correlation with our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages  probability distributions are derived from a variety of underlying information  including recent historical experience  but with the application of judgment as appropriate 
the nature of some of these businesses lends itself less to the analysis that we use on our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages  reflecting both the nature of available exposure information  and the impact of human factors such as tort exposure 
we produce probability distributions to represent our underlying risks  which we believe helps us to make consistent underwriting decisions  and manage our total risk portfolio 
overall we undertake to construct conservative representations of the risks within our models 
individual risk for our catastrophe exposed business in our individual risk segment  we utilize proprietary modeling tools that have been developed in conjunction with the modeling and other resources utilized in our reinsurance operations  as described above 
we also combine these analyses with those of our reinsurance segment to monitor our aggregate group catastrophic exposures 
for the business produced through program managers  we seek to carefully identify and evaluate potential program managers 
when evaluating a potential new program manager  we consider numerous factors including i whether the program manager can provide and help us analyze historic loss and other business data  ii whether the program manager will bear profit sharing risk and provide us with the other terms and conditions we require  iii the integrity and experience of the program manager  iv the potential profitability of the program to us  and v the availability of our internal resources to appropriately conduct due diligence  negotiate and execute transaction terms  and provide the ongoing monitoring we require 
in considering pricing for the products to be offered by the program manager  we evaluate the expected frequency and severity of losses  the costs of providing the necessary coverage including the cost of administering policy benefits  sales and other administrative and overhead costs and a margin for profit 
we actively develop and maintain proprietary databases and models to support our underwriting and provide value added services to our partners 
these databases and models enable us to better identify and estimate the expected loss experience of particular products and are employed in the design of our products and the establishment of rates 
we also monitor pricing adequacy on our products by region  risk and producer 
subject to regulatory considerations  we seek to make timely premium and coverage modifications where we determine them to be appropriate 
we provide our program managers with written underwriting guidelines and monitor their compliance with our guidelines on a regular basis 
also  our contracts generally provide that a portion of the commission payable to our program managers will be on a retrospective basis  which is intended to permit us to adjust commissions based on our profitability and claims experience 
we rely on our program managers to perform underwriting pursuant to these contractual guidelines  and believe we benefit from their superior local information and expertise in niche areas 
geographic breakdown our exposures are generally diversified across geographic zones  but are also a function of market conditions and opportunities 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our gross insurance and reinsurance premiums written allocated to the territory of coverage exposure

reserves for claims and claim expenses reserves for claims and claim expenses represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of an insurer s or reinsurer s expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
such estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency and other variable factors such as inflation 
it is likely that our ultimate liability in respect of these reserves will exceed or be less than our current estimates  possibly materially 
for our property catastrophe reinsurance operations  we initially set our reserves for claims and claim expenses based on case reserves and other reserve estimates reported by insureds and ceding companies 
we then add to these claims reserves  our estimates for additional case reserves and an estimate for incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
these estimates are normally based upon our experience with similar claims  our knowledge of potential industry loss levels for each loss  and industry information which we gather and retain in our rems modeling system 
the estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty associated with property catastrophe claims 
in reserving for our specialty reinsurance and individual risk coverages we currently do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in these lines 
currently we estimate our ibnr reserves for our specialty reinsurance and individual risk coverages by utilizing an actuarial method known as the bornhuetter ferguson technique 
the utilization of the bornhuetter ferguson technique requires us to estimate an ultimate claims and claim expense ratio and select an estimated loss reporting pattern for each line of business that we offer 
we select our estimates of the ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and estimated loss reporting patterns by reviewing industry standards and adjusting these standards based upon the coverages and terms of coverages that we offer 
because any reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate of its ultimate liability  and since there are numerous factors which affect reserves but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our initial estimate of reserves 
in response to these inherent uncertainties  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates 
in recent years  we have experienced favorable adjustments to our reserves  principally relating to catastrophe exposed coverages 
in future periods  assuming future reported and paid claims activity is consistent with that of recent quarters  and barring unforeseen circumstances  we believe that  as our reserves on older accident years continue to age  we may experience further reductions to our older accident year reserves 
however  there can be no assurance that such reductions will occur 
all of our estimates are reviewed annually with an independent actuarial firm 
we also review certain assumptions and methodologies on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the quarter in which they are identified 
although we believe that we are cautious in our assumptions  and in the application of our methodologies  we cannot be certain that our ultimate payments will not vary  perhaps materially  from the estimates we have made 
adjustments to our claims reserves will increase current year net income if our current estimates of prior year claims reserves are lower than the initial estimates or will decrease net income if our current estimates of prior year claims reserves are greater than the initial estimates 
we incurred net claims of  million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our total gross reserves for claims and claim expenses was  million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following table represents the development of our generally accepted accounting principles gaap balance sheet reserves for through december  this table does not present accident or policy year development data 
the top line of the table shows the gross reserves for claims and claim expenses at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years 
this represents the estimated amounts of claims and claim expenses arising in the current year and all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date  including ibnr reserves 
the table also shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserve based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
the cumulative redundancy deficiency on net reserves represents the aggregate change to date from the indicated estimate of the gross reserve for claims and claim expenses  net of losses recoverable on the second line of the table 
the table also shows the cumulative net paid amounts as of successive years with respect to the net reserve liability 
at the bottom of the table is a reconciliation of the gross reserve for claims and claim expenses to the net reserve for claims and claim expenses  the gross re estimated liability to the net re estimated liability for claims and claim expenses  and the cumulative redundancy deficiency on gross reserves 
with respect to the information in the table below  it should be noted that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods

our largest product has historically been property catastrophe reinsurance where we have exposure to natural and man made disasters  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  tsunamis  winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes and other natural and man made disasters  such as terrorism 
the estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty associated with property catastrophe claims 
because any reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate of its ultimate liability  and since there are numerous factors which affect reserves but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our initial estimate of reserves 
therefore  in response to these inherent uncertainties  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates 
in recent years  we have experienced favorable adjustments to our reserves  principally relating to catastrophe exposed coverages 
in future periods  assuming future reported and paid claims activity is consistent with that of recent quarters  and barring unforeseen circumstances  we believe that  as our reserves on older accident years continue to age  we may experience further reductions to our older accident year reserves 
however  there can be no assurance that such reductions will occur 
the following table presents an analysis of our paid  unpaid and incurred losses and loss expenses and a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserves for claims and claims expenses for the years indicated

the prior year favorable reserve development in of million included million attributable to our reinsurance segment and million attributable to our individual risk segment 
the reduction in prior years estimated ultimate claims reserves in our reinsurance segment was primarily due to a re estimation of our ultimate losses associated with six large catastrophe events  which produced a reduction of approximately million  a million reduction in reserves from numerous smaller catastrophe events and million in reductions from our specialty book of business 
the reductions in our reserves for the smaller catastrophe events  the reserves for the specialty book of business and the reserves for our individual risk segment were driven by the application of our formulaic methodology used for these books of business and is primarily due to the actual paid and reported loss activity being better than what we anticipated when setting the initial ibnr reserves 
as at december   the prior year net favorable reserve development in of million was primarily due to favorable reserve development of million in our reinsurance segment and million in our individual risk segment 
within the reinsurance segment our property catastrophe line of business recorded million in favorable reserve development 
this was driven by reductions in the estimated losses on relatively small catastrophes for the through accident years 
the largest net favorable reserve development on a single event was million which related to the reduction in the ultimate cost to settle net claims arising from the european floods of our specialty line of business within the reinsurance segment had favorable reserve development of million in which was principally driven by reductions from the accident year 
our individual risk segment had favorable reserve development of million in which was driven by favorable reserve development in the accident year associated with the company s bermuda based property business 
net claims and claim expenses incurred were reduced by million during million related to income earned on assumed reinsurance contracts that were classified as deposit contracts with underwriting risk only 
other income was reduced by million during nil related to losses incurred on assumed reinsurance contracts that were classified as deposit contracts with timing risk only 
a deposit liability of million is included in reinsurance balances payable at december  million and a deposit asset of million is included in other assets at december  nil 
our gross case reserves and ibnr by line of business at december  and are as follows

notwithstanding the foregoing  our investments are subject to market wide risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities 
the large majority of our investment portfolios consists of highly rated fixed income securities  however  over time we have increased our exposure to other investments  including hedge funds  private equity partnerships and other investments 
at december  these other investments totaled million million or of our total investments 
it is likely that we will increase our holdings of other investments in the future 
at december  our non investment grade fixed maturity investments totaled million or of our total fixed maturity investments  and at december  these non investment grade fixed maturity investments totaled million or of our fixed maturity investments 
at december   our fixed maturities and short term investment portfolio had a dollar weighted average credit quality rating of aa 
at december   our average yield to maturity was before investment expenses 
we currently have a target duration of years for our fixed maturities and short term investments 
our duration at december  was years years  reflecting our view that the current level of rates affords inadequate compensation for the assumption of additional interest rate risk 
from time to time  we may reevaluate the target duration in light of our liabilities and market conditions 
as with other fixed income investments  the value of our fixed maturity investments will fluctuate with changes in the interest rate environment and when changes occur in the overall investment market and in overall economic conditions 
additionally  our differing asset classes expose us to other risks which could cause a reduction in the value of our investments 
examples of some of these risks include

changes in the overall interest rate environment can expose us to prepayment risk on our mortgage backed investments 
when interest rates decline  consumers will generally make prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
will be repaid to us more quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
when we receive these prepayments  our opportunities to reinvest these proceeds back into the investment markets will normally be at reduced interest rates

our investments in debt securities of other corporations are exposed to losses from insolvencies of these corporations  and our investment portfolio can also deteriorate based on reduced credit quality of these corporations 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
our investments in asset backed securities are subject to prepayment risks  as noted above  and to the structural risks of these securities 
the structural risks primarily emanate from the priority of each security in the issuer s overall capital structure 
the following table summarizes the fair value by contractual maturities of our fixed maturity investment portfolio at the dates indicated 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalty

the company s fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on these investments is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
net investment income includes interest income together with amortization of market premiums and discounts and is net of investment management and custody fees 
the amortization of premium and accretion of discount for fixed maturity investments is computed using the effective yield method 
fair values of fixed maturity investments are based on quoted market prices  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications and or internal pricing valuation techniques 
realized gains or losses on the sale of fixed maturity investments are determined using the average cost method and include adjustments to the cost for declines in value that are considered to be other than temporary 
the company routinely assesses whether declines in the fair value of its fixed maturity investments below cost represent impairments that are other than temporary 
there are several factors that are considered in the assessment of a security  which include i the time period during which there has been a significant decline below cost  ii the extent of the decline below cost  iii the company s intent and ability to hold the security  iv the potential for the security to recover in value  v an analysis of the financial condition of the issuer and vi an analysis of the collateral structure and credit support of the security  if applicable 
where the company has determined that there is an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the security  the cost of the security is written down to the fair value and the unrealized loss at the time of the determination is charged to income 
the following table presents an analysis of the continuous periods during which the company has held fixed maturity investment positions which were carried at an unrealized loss as of december  and

the fair value of certain of our other investments is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments 
these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sale which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
due to a lag in the valuations reported by the fund managers  the majority of our hedge fund and private equity partnership valuations are reported on a one month or one quarter lag 
interest income  income distributions and realized and unrealized gains and losses on other investments are included in net investment income and totaled million million of which million million was related to net unrealized gains 
we have committed capital to private equity partnerships of million  of which million was contributed at december  equity investments in reinsurance company 
the equity investments in reinsurance company relate to our november  purchase of  common shares of platinum in a private placement transaction 
in addition  we received a year warrant to purchase up to million additional common shares of platinum for per share 
we purchased the common shares and warrant for an aggregate price of million 
at december   we owned exclusive of the warrant of platinum s outstanding common shares 
we have recorded our investment in platinum at fair value  and at december  the aggregate fair value was million million 
the fair value of the common shares is based on the market price of platinum s shares as at the balance sheet date 
the fair value of the warrant is estimated by us using the black scholes option pricing model 
the aggregate unrealized gain of million million on the platinum common shares is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  a lockup provision on the warrant expired and as a result the warrant met the definition of a derivative under fas and therefore changes in the fair value of the warrant were recorded prospectively in other income from november at december   million was recorded in other income representing the unrealized gain on the warrant 
this includes a million one time reclassification from other comprehensive income to other income which occurred during the fourth quarter of with the million remainder being the increase in fair value from november at december   the aggregate unrealized gain on the platinum warrant was million which was included in other comprehensive income 
investments in other ventures  under equity method 
investment in other ventures  under equity method includes our investment in channel re of million million  which is carried using the equity method 
we invested million in channel re and our earnings from channel re  which are reported one quarter in arrears  totaled million in nil and are included in other income 
investments in other ventures  under equity method also includes our investment in top layer re of million million  which is owned by renaissance reinsurance and is carried using the equity method 
our earnings from top layer re totaled million for the year ended december  million and are included in other income 
in addition  in the company also invested in a joint venture focused on trading weather sensitive commodities and securities  the earnings from which were included in other income until the third quarter of as a result of the restructuring of the joint venture as at july   the balance of the investment was recorded in other investments and the income from the investment was recorded in investment income for the remainder of the year 
the earnings from this investment recorded in other income totaled million in rihl 
in  we commenced utilization of our subsidiary rihl  a bermuda company we organized for the primary purpose of holding the investments in high quality marketable securities of renaissancere  our operating subsidiaries and certain of our joint venture affiliates 
rihl permits us to consolidate and substantially facilitate our investment management operations 
renaissancere and each of our participating operating subsidiaries and affiliates has transferred to rihl marketable securities or other assets  in return for a subscription of rihl equity interests 
each rihl share is redeemable for cash or in marketable securities 
over time  the participants in rihl are expected to both subscribe for additional shares and redeem outstanding shares  as our and their respective liquidity needs change 
as a result of the high quality of the assets transferred to and maintained by it  rihl has been rated aaaf s by s p 
we have exclusive responsibility for managing the day to day affairs of rihl and have sole management responsibility over its portfolio 
mellon bank  na  provides rihl with certain custodial functions  including custody of its outstanding shares and valuation of its assets 
under the terms of certain reinsurance contracts  certain of our subsidiaries and joint ventures may be required to provide letters of credit to reinsureds in respect of reported claims and or unearned premiums 
as described below under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary of results of operations for  and capital resources  we maintain a facility which  as of january   makes available to our operating subsidiaries and joint ventures letters of credit having an aggregate face amount not to exceed million 
to support the facility  our participating operating subsidiaries and joint ventures have pledged rihl shares and other securities owned by them as collateral 
we had outstanding letters of credit of million at december  million 
competition the insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive and  provided that a company has sufficient capital and necessary management expertise  the barriers to entry into the reinsurance markets are not significant 
with total managed catastrophe premiums written of million for the year ended december   we are one of the largest providers of property catastrophe reinsurance in the world 
our principal competition in the industry comes from major us and us insurers and reinsurers  including other bermuda based reinsurers 
though these companies offer property catastrophe reinsurance  in many cases it accounts for a relatively small percentage of their total portfolio 
our competition with respect to our specialty reinsurance business generally also comes from the same us and non us insurers and reinsurers 
in our individual risk business  we face competition from independent insurance companies  subsidiaries or affiliates of major worldwide companies and others  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
primary insurers compete on the basis of various factors including distribution channels  product  price  service  financial strength and reputation 
the reinsurance markets are continuing to accumulate capital by retaining profits 
also  hedge funds have shown increasing interest in entering the reinsurance market  either through the formation of reinsurance companies  or through the use of other financial products 
following the world trade center disaster  a number of new companies were formed to compete in the reinsurance and specialty insurance markets 
a number of these new companies were formed in bermuda 
in addition  a number of existing market participants raised new capital  thereby strengthening their ability to compete 
we are also aware of many potential initiatives by capital market participants to produce alternative products that may compete with the existing catastrophe reinsurance markets 
among other matters  over the last several years capital markets participants  including exchanges and financial intermediaries  have developed financial products intended to compete with traditional reinsurance 
in addition  the tax policies of the countries where our clients operate can affect demand for reinsurance 
we are unable to predict the extent to which the foregoing new  proposed or potential initiatives may affect the demand for our products or the risks which may be available for us to consider offering coverage 
industry trends the reinsurance and insurance industries have been markedly cyclical  characterized by periods of decreasing prices followed by periods of increasing prices 
the pricing environment is influenced by changes  sometimes substantial  in the level of both demand and supply of insurance or reinsurance  often these changes are the result of changes in the perception of risk following large industry loss events 
in particular  the catastrophe exposed lines in which we are a market leader are affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including natural and man made disasters  such as hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  floods  fires  explosions  and acts of terrorism  such as the world trade center disaster 
the occurrence  or nonoccurrence  of catastrophic events  the frequency and severity of which are inherently unpredictable  affects both industry results and consequently prevailing market prices of our products 
the following are certain industry trends we have observed 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
the property markets are becoming increasingly competitive  despite the occurrence of various natural disasters in  partially due to the increase in capital of new and existing market participants 
accordingly  there are price declines in many markets 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
prices in the specialty reinsurance markets are also generally declining 
however  we continue to find opportunities in a small number of large transactions that are specific to our close relationships with our clients 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
in our individual risk business  there is continued softening in the commercial property markets 
however  we continue to see opportunities in select lines of business

the long term credit quality of insurance and reinsurance companies  and the related credit ratings of those companies are becoming an increasing concern of many insurance and reinsurance customers 
we believe this will offer opportunities to companies such as ours with strong credit ratings  a seasoned management team  and a history of successful performance 
a substantial amount of capital has entered the insurance and reinsurance markets both through investments in established companies and through start up ventures 
also  as noted above  hedge funds have been increasingly active in the reinsurance market and markets for related risks 
it is possible that the new capital in the market could cause further reductions in prices of our products 
to the extent that industry pricing of our products does not meet our hurdle rate  we would plan to reduce our future underwriting activities thus resulting in reduced premiums and a reduction in expected earnings 
a reduction in our underwriting activities could result in excess capital which we may return to our shareholders by way of share repurchases 
we currently have board authorization to repurchase up to million of shares 
any such repurchase will be subject to market conditions and other factors 
marketing reinsurance we believe that our modeling and technical expertise  and the risk management advice that we provide to our clients  has enabled us to become a provider of first choice to our insurers and reinsurers worldwide 
we market our reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through reinsurance brokers 
we focus our marketing efforts on targeted brokers and insurance and reinsurance companies 
we believe that our existing portfolio of business is a valuable asset and  therefore  we attempt to continually strengthen relationships with our existing brokers and clients 
we target prospects that are capable of supplying detailed and accurate underwriting data and that potentially add further diversification to our book of business 
we believe that primary insurers and brokers willingness to use a particular reinsurer is based not just on pricing  but also on the financial security of the reinsurer  its claim paying ability ratings  the quality of a reinsurer s service  the reinsurer s willingness to design customized programs  its long term stability and its commitment to provide reinsurance capacity 
we have established a reputation with our brokers and clients for prompt response on underwriting submissions  fast claims payments and a reputation for providing creative solutions to our customers needs 
since we selectively write large lines on a limited number of property catastrophe reinsurance contracts  we can establish reinsurance terms and conditions on those contracts that are attractive in our judgment  make large commitments to the most attractive programs and provide superior client responsiveness 
we believe that our ability to design customized programs and to provide advice on catastrophe risk management has helped us to develop long term relationships with brokers and clients 
our reinsurance brokers assess client needs and perform data collection  contract preparation and other administrative tasks  enabling us to market our reinsurance products cost effectively by maintaining a smaller staff 
we believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers  we are able to obtain access to a broad range of potential reinsureds 
subsidiaries and affiliates of marsh inc  the benfield group limited  the willis group and aon corporation accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our gross reinsurance premiums written in during  our reinsurance operations issued authorization for coverage on programs submitted by brokers worldwide brokers 
we received approximately  program submissions during approximately 
of these submissions  we issued authorizations for coverage for over programs  or approximately of the program submissions received approximately programs  or approximately 
individual risk our individual risk products are offered through a select number of specialized program managers and through brokered quota share relationships with other insurance companies 
our individual risk products are also marketed through a diverse group of surplus lines brokers operating primarily in catastrophe exposed states 
our financial security ratings  combined with our reputation in the reinsurance marketplace  have enhanced our presence in the individual risk markets 
our individual risk operations are structured to create and maintain a comprehensive database of catastrophe exposed property risks 
in our program business opportunities  we establish relationships with program managers  providing them with modeling expertise and risk analysis 
we strive to work closely with these program managers  with the goal of obtaining a long term competitive advantage in their respective niche markets 
we believe that our existing program managers are an important source of referrals and endorsements of our unique approach 
we have also partnered with a limited number of insurance companies on a quota share reinsurance basis 
in most cases  catastrophe risk is a substantial component of the risk and we assist in evaluating and managing this risk 
employees at december   we and our subsidiaries employed people 
we believe that our strong employee relations are among our most significant strengths 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements at any of our subsidiaries 
a majority of our employees receive some form of equity based incentive compensation as part of their overall compensation package 
at march   our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common shares 
in addition  all of our directors and executive officers are subject to stock ownership guidelines that require each to hold a specified amount of stock 
many of our bermuda based employees  including a majority of our senior executives  are employed pursuant to work permits granted by the bermuda authorities 
these permits expire at various times over the next few years 
bermuda government policy limits the duration of work permits to a total of six years  which is subject to certain exemptions for key employees 
regulation bermuda regulation registration 
the insurance act  as amended  and related regulations the insurance act  which regulates the business of our bermuda insurance subsidiaries  provides that no person may carry on an insurance business including the business of reinsurance in or from within bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the insurance act by the bermuda monetary authority the bma 
renaissance reinsurance and davinci are registered as class insurers  and glencoe  lantana and top layer re are registered as class insurers under the insurance act 
the bma  in deciding whether to grant registration  has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest 
the bma is required by the insurance act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and  in particular  whether it has  or has available to it  adequate knowledge and expertise 
in connection with the applicant s registration  the bma may impose conditions relating to the writing of certain types of insurance 
further  the insurance act stipulates that no person shall  in or from within bermuda  act as an insurance manager  broker  agent or salesman unless registered for the purpose by the bma 
ventures is registered as an insurance manager under the insurance act 
an insurance advisory committee appointed by the bermuda minister of finance the minister advises the bma on matters connected with the discharge of its functions  and sub committees thereof supervise and review the law and practice of insurance in bermuda  including reviews of accounting and administrative procedures 
the insurance act imposes on bermuda insurance companies solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and grants to the bma powers to supervise  investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
certain significant aspects of the bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below 
cancellation of insurer s registration 
an insurer s registration may be canceled by the bma on certain grounds specified in the insurance act  including failure of the insurer to comply with a requirement made of it under the insurance act or  if in the opinion of the bma  after consultation with the insurance advisory committee  the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles 
independent approved auditor 
every registered insurer must appoint an independent auditor who will annually audit and report on the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return of the insurer  both of which  in the case of each of a class insurer and a class insurer  are required to be filed annually with the bma 
the auditor must be approved by the bma as the independent auditor of the insurer 
if the insurer fails to appoint an approved auditor or at any time fails to fill a vacancy for such auditor  the bma may appoint an approved auditor for the insurer and shall fix the remuneration to be paid to the approved auditor within fourteen days  if not agreed sooner by the insurer and the auditor 
the approved auditor may be the same person or firm which audits the insurer s financial statements and reports for presentation to its shareholders 
loss reserve specialist 
each class and class insurer is required to submit an annual loss reserve opinion when filing the annual statutory financial return 
this opinion must be issued by the insurer s approved loss reserve specialist 
the loss reserve specialist  who will normally be a qualified casualty actuary  must be approved by the bma 
statutory financial statements 
an insurer must prepare annual statutory financial statements 
the insurance act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of such statutory financial statements which include  in statutory form  a balance sheet  income statement  and a statement of capital and surplus  and detailed notes thereto 
the insurer is required to give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums  claims  reinsurance and investments 
the statutory financial statements are not prepared in accordance with gaap and are distinct from the financial statements prepared for presentation to the insurer s shareholders under the companies act of bermuda  which financial statements may be prepared in accordance with gaap 
the insurer is required to submit the annual statutory financial statements as part of the annual statutory financial return 
the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return do not form part of the public records maintained by the bma 
minimum solvency margin and restrictions on dividends and distributions 
the insurance act provides that the statutory assets of an insurer must exceed its statutory liabilities by an amount greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margin which varies with the type of registration of the insurer under the insurance act and the insurer s net premiums written and loss reserve level 
the minimum solvency margin for a class insurer is the greatest of million  of net premiums written with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding of gross premiums and of loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves 
the minimum solvency margin for a class insurer is the greatest of million  of the first million of net premiums written plus of net premiums written in excess of million  and of loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves 
the insurance act mandates certain actions and filings with the bma if a class insurer or a class insurer fails to meet and or maintain the required minimum solvency margin 
both class insurers and class insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends if in breach of the required minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio the relevant margins or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause the insurer to fail to meet the relevant margins 
where an insurer fails to meet its relevant margins on the last day of any financial year  it is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the bma 
further  a class insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus as shown on its previous financial year s statutory balance sheet unless it files at least seven days before payment of such dividends with the bma an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet its relevant margins 
class insurers and class insurers must obtain the bma s prior approval for a reduction by or more of the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year s financial statements 
these restrictions on declaring or paying dividends and distributions under the insurance act are in addition to those under the companies act which apply to all bermuda companies 
annual statutory financial return 
class and class insurers are required to file with the bma a statutory financial return no later than four months after the insurer s financial year end unless specifically extended 
the statutory financial return includes  among other items  a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements of the insurer  a declaration of the statutory ratios  a solvency certificate  the statutory financial statements themselves  the opinion of the approved loss reserve specialist in respect of the loss and loss expense provisions and  only in the case of class insurers  certain details concerning ceded reinsurance 
the solvency certificate and the declaration of the statutory ratios must be signed by the principal representative and at least two directors of the insurer  who are required to state whether the minimum solvency margin and  in the case of the solvency certificate  the minimum liquidity ratio  have been met  and the independent approved auditor is required to state whether in its opinion it was reasonable for them to so state and whether the declaration of the statutory ratios complies with the requirements of the insurance act 
where an insurer s accounts have been audited for any purpose other than compliance with the insurance act  a statement to that effect must be filed with the statutory financial return 
supervision  investigation and intervention 
the bma may appoint an inspector with extensive powers to investigate the affairs of an insurer if the bma believes that an investigation is required in the interest of the insurer s policyholders or persons who may become policyholders 
in order to verify or supplement information otherwise provided to them  the bma may direct an insurer to produce documents or information relating to matters connected with the insurer s business 
moreover  the bma has the power to appoint professional persons to prepare reports about registered insurers  such as renaissance reinsurance  davinci and glencoe 
if it appears to the bma to be desirable in the interests of policyholders  the bma may also exercise these powers in relation to subsidiaries  parents and other affiliates of registered insurers 
if it appears to the bma that there is a risk of the insurer becoming insolvent  or that the insurer is in breach of the insurance act or any conditions or its registration under the insurance act  the bma may direct the insurer not to take on any new insurance business  not to vary any insurance contract if the effect would be to increase the insurer s liabilities  not to make certain investments  to realize or not to realize certain investments  to maintain in  or transfer to the custody of  a specified bank  certain assets  not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions or to restrict the making of such payments and or to limit its premium income 
in addition to powers under the insurance act to investigate the affairs of an insurer  the bma may require certain information from an insurer or certain other persons to be produced to them 
the bma has the power to assist other regulatory authorities  including foreign insurance regulatory authorities  with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in bermuda if the bma is satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities and that such cooperation is in the public interest 
under the companies act  the minister has been given powers to assist a foreign regulatory authority which has requested assistance in connection with inquiries being carried out by it in the performance of its regulatory functions 
the minister s powers include requiring a person to furnish him with information  to produce documents to him  to attend and answer questions and to give assistance in connection with enquiries 
the minister must be satisfied that the assistance requested by the foreign regulatory authority is for the purpose of its regulatory functions and that the request is in relation to information in bermuda which a person has in his possession or under his control 
the minister must consider  amongst other things  whether it is in the public interest to give the information sought 
an insurer is required to maintain a principal office in bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in bermuda 
for the purpose of the insurance act  the principal office of each of renaissance reinsurance  davinci and glencoe is at our offices at renaissance house  east broadway  pembroke hm bermuda 
without a reason acceptable to the bma  an insurer may not terminate the appointment of its principal representative  and the principal representative may not cease to act as such  unless thirty days notice in writing to the bma is given of the intention to do so 
it is the duty of the principal representative  having formed the view that there is a likelihood of the insurer for which he acts becoming insolvent or its coming to his knowledge  or his having reason to believe that a reportable event has occurred  to orally notify the bma immediately and  within fourteen days of the relevant view having been formed  to make a report in writing to the bma setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to him 
examples of such an event include failure by the insurer to comply substantially with a condition imposed upon the insurer by the bma relating to a solvency margin or a liquidity or other ratio 
certain other bermuda law considerations 
as exempted companies  we and our bermuda subsidiaries are exempt from certain bermuda laws restricting the percentage of share capital that may be held by non bermudians 
however  as exempted companies  we and our bermuda subsidiaries may not participate in certain business transactions  including the acquisition or holding of land in bermuda except that required for their business and held by way of lease or tenancy for terms of not more than years without required authorization  the taking of mortgages on land in bermuda to secure an amount in excess of  without the consent of the minister  the acquisition of any bonds or debentures secured by any land in bermuda  other than certain types of bermuda government securities or securities issued by bermuda public authorities or the carrying on of business of any kind in bermuda  except in furtherance of our business carried on outside bermuda or under license granted by the minister 
generally it is not permitted without a special license granted by the minister to insure bermuda domestic risks or risks of persons of  in or based in bermuda 
we and our bermuda subsidiaries must comply with the provisions of the companies act regulating the payment of dividends and making distributions from contributed surplus 
a company may not declare or pay a dividend  or make a distribution out of contributed surplus  if there are reasonable grounds for believing that a the company is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or b the realizable value of the company s assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
us regulation reinsurance regulation 
our bermuda operations consist of renaissance reinsurance  davinci  glencoe and lantana 
renaissance reinsurance and davinci are bermuda based companies that operate as reinsurers 
although neither company is admitted to transact the business of insurance in any jurisdiction except bermuda  the insurance laws of each state of the us regulate the sale of reinsurance to ceding insurers authorized in the state by non admitted alien reinsurers  such as renaissance reinsurance or davinci  acting from locations outside the state 
rates  policy terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any governmental authority 
a primary insurer ordinarily will enter into a reinsurance agreement  however  only if it can obtain credit for the reinsurance ceded on its statutory financial statements 
in general  regulators permit ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance in the following circumstances

if none of the above apply  to the extent that the reinsurance obligations of the reinsurer are collateralized appropriately  typically through the posting of a letter of credit for the benefit of the primary insurer or the deposit of assets into a trust fund established for the benefit of the primary insurer 
as alien companies  our bermuda insurers collateralize their reinsurance obligations to us insurance companies 
with some exceptions  the sale of insurance or reinsurance from within a jurisdiction where the insurer is not admitted to do business is prohibited 
neither renaissance reinsurance nor davinci intend to maintain an office or to solicit  advertise  settle claims or conduct other insurance activities in any jurisdiction other than bermuda where the conduct of such activities would require that each company be so admitted 
excess and surplus lines regulation 
glencoe and lantana  both domiciled in bermuda  are not licensed in the us but are eligible to offer coverage in the us exclusively in the surplus lines market 
glencoe is eligible to write surplus lines primary insurance in jurisdictions of the us and is subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of those jurisdictions 
lantana is currently eligible as a surplus lines insurer in jurisdictions of the us  and is subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of those jurisdictions 
in accordance with certain provisions of the national association of insurance commissioners naic nonadmitted insurance model act  which provisions have been adopted by a number of states  glencoe and lantana have each established  and are required to maintain  a trust funded to a minimum amount as a condition of its status as an eligible  non admitted insurer in the us the regulation of surplus lines insurance differs significantly from the licensed or admitted market 
the regulations governing the surplus lines market have been designed to facilitate the procurement of coverage  through specially licensed surplus lines brokers  for hard to place risks that do not fit standard underwriting criteria and are otherwise eligible to be written on a surplus lines basis 
most particularly  surplus lines regulation generally provides for more flexible rules relating to insurance rates and forms 
however  strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements under the laws of every state  and state insurance regulations generally require that a risk must be declined by three admitted carriers before it may be placed in the surplus lines market 
initial eligibility requirements and annual requalification standards apply to insurance carriers writing on a surplus basis and filing obligations must also be met 
in most states  surplus lines brokers are responsible for collecting and remitting the surplus lines tax payable to the state where the risk is located 
companies such as glencoe and lantana which conduct business on a surplus lines basis in a particular state are generally exempt from that state s guaranty fund laws 
admitted market regulation 
our admitted us operations currently consist of stonington and stonington lloyd s insurance company stonington lloyd s  both texas domiciled insurers 
in addition  our subsidiary newstead insurance company newstead was recently approved for admission as a delaware domiciled insurer  although newstead has not yet conducted any business 
as licensed insurers operating in the admitted market  these companies are subject to extensive regulation under us statutes 
the extent of regulation varies from state to state but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state 
among other things  state insurance commissioners regulate insurer solvency standards  insurer licensing  authorized investments  premium rates  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy  loss and expense reserves and provisions for unearned premiums  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  policy form approval  policy renewals and non renewals  and market conduct regulation including both underwriting and claims practices 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and quarterly financial reports 
the texas department of insurance retains primary regulatory authority for stonington and stonington lloyd s and the delaware department of insurance does so for newstead 
in general  licensed us insurers such as stonington and stonington lloyd s must file with the state departments of insurance where they insure risks all rates for directly underwritten insurance 
licensed us insurers are required to participate in the guaranty associations of the states where they conduct business 
such participation can result in assessments  up to prescribed limits  for losses incurred by policyholders as a result of the impairment or insolvency of unaffiliated insurance companies 
additionally  some states require licensed insurers to participate in assigned risk plans which provide coverage for automobile insurance and other lines for insureds that are unable to obtain insurance in the open market 
participation in assigned risk pools may take the form of reinsuring a portion of a pool of policies or directly issuing policies to insureds 
an insurer s participation in these plans is typically calculated based on the amount of premium written by the insurer on a voluntary basis for that line of coverage in a prior year 
assigned risk pools generally produce losses which result in assessments to insurers writing the same lines on a voluntary basis 
we do not expect the amount of any such guaranty fund assessments  if any  or other assessments to be paid by us in to be material 
holding company regulation 
we and our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various jurisdictions 
the insurance holding company laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  but generally require an insurance holding company  and insurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies  to register with state regulatory authorities and to file with those authorities certain reports  including information concerning their capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and general business operations 
further  in order to protect insurance company solvency  state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies 
texas  stonington s and stonington lloyd s state of domicile  currently requires that dividends be paid only out of earned statutory surplus and limits the annual amount of dividends payable without the prior approval of the texas insurance department to the greater of of statutory capital and surplus at the end of the previous calendar year or of statutory net income from operations for the previous calendar year 
because of the accumulated deficit in earned surplus from prior operations  stonington currently cannot pay an ordinary dividend 
these insurance holding company laws also impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions with affiliates 
in addition  as a result of our ownership of stonington  under the terms of applicable state statutes  any person or entity desiring to purchase more than of our outstanding voting securities is required to obtain prior regulatory approval for the purchase 
terrorism 
on november   the president of the us signed into law the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  providing that through  the federal government will share with the insurance industry the risk of loss from future terrorist attacks 
each participating insurance company must pay covered losses equal to a deductible based on a percentage of direct earned premiums for commercial insurance lines from the previous calendar year 
the deductible ranges from on the date of enactment to in for losses in excess of a company s deductible  the federal government will cover of the excess losses  while companies retain the remaining 
losses covered by the program will be capped annually at billion 
primary insurance companies providing commercial property and casualty insurance in the us  such as stonington  stonington lloyd s  glencoe and lantana  are required to participate in the tria program 
tria also requires that subject insurers comply with mandatory offer requirements for terrorism coverage 
these offers may be rejected by insureds 
the secretary of the department of the treasury extended this offer requirement until december  tria generally does not purport to govern the obligations of reinsurers  such as renaissance reinsurance and davinci  under reinsurance contracts 
unless extended by congress  the tria program expires december  there is substantial uncertainty as to whether congress will extend the program beyond its scheduled expiration in  and it is possible that the non renewal of tria could adversely affect the industry 
naic ratios 
the naic has established financial ratios to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of licensed us insurance companies operating in their respective states 
the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris calculates these ratios based on information submitted by insurers on an annual basis and shares the information with the applicable state insurance departments 
generally  an insurance company will be subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges with respect to four or more of the ratios 
codification of statutory accounting principles 
in their ongoing effort to improve solvency regulations  the naic and individual states have enacted certain laws and statutory financial statement reporting requirements 
these regulatory initiatives  and the overall focus on solvency  may intensify the restructuring and consolidation of the insurance industry 
we believe we will be adequately positioned to compete in an environment of more stringent regulation 
risk based capital 
the naic has implemented a risk based capital rbc formula and model law applicable to all licensed us property casualty insurance companies 
the rbc formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business 
such analysis permits regulators to identify inadequately capitalized insurers 
the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of statutory capital by applying certain factors to insurers business risks such as asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk and off balance sheet risk 
the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer s size  but also on the risk profile of the insurer s operations 
the gramm leach bliley act 
the gramm leach bliley act of glba permits mergers that combine commercial banks  insurers and securities firms under one holding company  a financial holding company 
until passage of the glba  the glass steagall act of  as amended  had limited the ability of banks to engage in securities related businesses  and the bank holding company act of  as amended  had restricted banks from being affiliated with insurers 
as a result of glba  the ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may affect our us subsidiaries product lines by substantially increasing the number  size and financial strength of potential competitors 
privacy provisions of glba became fully effective in these provisions established consumer protections regarding the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information and require full disclosure of the privacy policies of financial institutions  including us insurers  to their consumer customers 
legislative and regulatory proposals 
government intervention in the insurance and reinsurance markets  both in the us and worldwide  continues to evolve 
federal and state legislators have considered numerous government initiatives 
while we cannot predict the exact nature  timing  or scope of other such proposals  if adopted they could adversely affect our business by

disproportionately benefiting the companies of one country over those of another 
in addition  the expansion of our primary insurance operations  together with the potential of further expansion into additional insurance markets  could expose us or our subsidiaries to increasing regulatory oversight 
however  we intend to continue to conduct our operations so as to minimize the likelihood that renaissance reinsurance  davinci  top layer  lantana or glencoe will become subject to us regulation 
risk factors factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements contained in this form k and other documents we file with the sec include the following our exposure to catastrophic events could cause our financial results to vary significantly from one period to the next 
our largest product is property catastrophe reinsurance 
we also sell lines of specialty reinsurance and certain individual risk products that are also exposed to catastrophe risk 
we therefore have a large overall exposure to natural and man made disasters  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  tsunamis  winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  tornados and other natural or man made disasters  such as acts of terrorism 
as a result  our operating results have historically been  and we expect will continue to be  significantly affected by relatively few events of large magnitude 
claims from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our ability to write new business could also be impacted 
we believe that increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation will increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future 
from time to time  we may have greater exposures in some geographic areas than our overall share of the worldwide market would suggest 
accordingly  if catastrophes were to occur in these areas  we could experience worse results than our competitors 
we may fail to execute our growth strategy  which would impair our future financial results 
historically  our principal product has been property catastrophe reinsurance 
our growth in our specialty reinsurance and individual risk lines of business presents us with new and expanded challenges and risks which we may not manage successfully 
we are not as experienced in these expanded lines of business as we are in property catastrophe reinsurance  in particular  we are continuing to expand our claim management function to support these new lines of business 
businesses in early stages of development present substantial business  financial and operational risks and may suffer significant losses 
for example  in our newer businesses we are seeking to develop client and customer relationships  build operating procedures  hire staff  install management information and other systems  as well as taking numerous other steps to implement our strategies 
our specialty reinsurance and individual risk businesses will require us to develop new expertise in areas such as contract and policy wordings and claims management 
if we fail to continue to develop the necessary infrastructure  or otherwise fail to execute our strategy  our results from these new lines of business will likely suffer  perhaps substantially  and our future financial results may be adversely affected 
this recent and planned future expansion has placed increased demands on our financial  managerial and human resources 
for example  we may need to attract additional professionals to  or expand our facilities in  bermuda  a small jurisdiction with limited resources 
to the extent we are unable to attract additional professionals  our financial  managerial and human resources may be strained 
the growth in our staff and infrastructure also creates more managerial responsibilities for our current senior executives  potentially diverting their attention from the underwriting and business origination functions for which they are also responsible 
our future profitability depends in part on our ability to further develop our resources and effectively manage this expansion 
our inability to achieve such development or effective management may impair our future financial results 
our utilization of program managers and other third parties to support our business exposes us to operational and financial risks 
our individual risk operations rely on program managers  and other agents and brokers participating in our programs  to produce and service a substantial portion of our operations in this segment 
in these arrangements  we typically grant the program manager the right to bind us to newly issued insurance policies  subject to underwriting guidelines we provide and other contractual restrictions and obligations 
should our managers issue policies that contravene these guidelines  restrictions or obligations  we could nonetheless be deemed liable for such policies 
although we would intend to resist claims that exceed or expand on our underwriting intention  it is possible that we would not prevail in such an action  or that our program manager would be unable to substantially indemnify us for their contractual breach 
we also rely on our managers  or other third parties we retain  to collect premiums and to pay valid claims 
this exposes us to their credit and operational risk  without necessarily relieving us of our obligations to potential insureds 
we could also be exposed to potential liabilities relating to the claims practices of the third party administrators we have retained to manage substantially all of the claims activity that we expect to arise in our program operations 
although we have implemented monitoring and other oversight protocols  we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to mitigate all of these exposures 
we are also subject to the risk that our successful program managers will not renew their programs with us 
our contracts are generally for defined terms of as little as one year  and either party can cancel the contract in a relatively short period of time 
while we believe our arrangements offer numerous benefits to our program participants  we cannot assure you we will retain the programs that produce profitable business or that our insureds will renew with us 
failure to retain or replace these producers would impair our ability to execute our growth strategy  and our financial results could be adversely affected 
we could face unanticipated losses from war  terrorism and political unrest  and these or other unanticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may have substantial exposure to unexpected  large losses resulting from future man made catastrophic events  such as acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability  or from other perils 
these risks are inherently unpredictable  and future periods may evidence increased frequency and severity of losses resulting from these catastrophic events 
it is difficult to predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty or to estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate 
although we believe our risk management systems are effective in helping us to understand and manage our aggregate risk portfolio  it is possible that our models have not adequately captured some catastrophe risks or other risks 
we believe it is impossible to eliminate completely our exposure to unforeseen or unpredictable events 
with respect to our reinsurance operations we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under our reinsurance contracts and  accordingly  like other reinsurers  are heavily dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by our ceding companies 
we are therefore subject to the risk that our clients may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured  or that the premiums ceded to us will not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume 
likewise  in our individual risk operations we are dependent on information provided by third parties  such as our program managers  claims administrators  and quota share cedants 
us government authorities are continuing to investigate non traditional  or loss mitigation  re insurance products  as well as our restatement of our financial statements 
we recently received subpoenas from the sec and from the office of the attorney general of the state of new york  each of which relates to the industry wide investigation into non traditional  or loss mitigation  re insurance products 
the subpoena from the sec also relates to our business practice review and to our determination to restate our financial statements 
see business recent developments and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of financial statements 
we intend to cooperate with the sec and the new york attorney general in their ongoing investigations 
while these government investigations are presently at a preliminary stage and we are unable to predict the ultimate impact  if any  they may have on our business  it is possible that the investigations may result in penalties or require remediation which may be adverse to us  perhaps materially so 
the government authorities may also identify new issues  or make additional findings that we are currently unable to predict  which may give rise to an adverse impact on our business or financial statements 
in general  we are unable to foresee all of the consequences of the government investigations 
following our announcement that we planned to restate our financial statements  s p placed on creditwatch with negative implications each of the counterparty credit  senior debt  and preferred stock ratings of the company  the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on renaissance reinsurance  and the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on davinci 
in addition  am best placed under review with negative implications the issuer credit ratings of the senior debt  preferred stock and capital securities of the company  and also the financial strength ratings of the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries of the company 
further  moody s revised from stable to negative the outlook for each of the insurance financial strength rating of renaissance reinsurance  and the senior debt  preferred stock and capital securities ratings of the company 
heightened scrutiny of issues and practices in the insurance industry may adversely affect our business 
the sec  the new york attorney general  and other government authorities are scrutinizing and investigating a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry 
it is possible that these investigations or related regulatory developments will mandate or otherwise give rise to changes in industry practices in a fashion that increases our costs or requires us to alter how we conduct our business 
because we frequently assume the credit risk of the brokers with whom we do business throughout our insurance and reinsurance operations  our results of operations could be adversely affected if the credit quality of these brokers is severely impacted by the current investigations in the insurance industry or by changes to broker industry practices 
our claims and claim expense reserves are subject to inherent uncertainties 
our claims and claim expense reserves reflect our estimates using actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  and our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
although we use actuarial and computer models as well as historical reinsurance and insurance industry loss statistics  we also rely heavily on management s experience and management s judgment to assist in the establishment of appropriate claim reserves 
however  because of the many assumptions and estimates involved in establishing reserves  the reserving process is inherently uncertain 
our growing casualty business is expected to produce claims which frequently can only be resolved through lengthy and unpredictable litigation 
the measures required to resolve such claims  including the adjudication process  present more reserve challenges than non casualty property losses the latter of which tend to be reported comparatively more promptly and to be settled within a relatively shorter period of time 
for both our growing casualty business  and our traditional property catastrophe business  actual net claims and claim expenses paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
we expect that some of our assumptions or estimates will prove to be inaccurate  and our actual net claims and claim expenses paid to differ  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
to the extent that our actual claims and claim expenses exceed our expectations  we would be required to increase claims and claim expense reserves 
this would reduce our net income by a corresponding amount in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
in reserving for our specialty reinsurance and individual risk coverages we do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in these lines 
unlike the claims and claim expense reserves of us insurers  the claims and claim expense reserves established by our bermuda companies are not regularly examined by insurance regulators 
emerging claim and coverage issues could adversely affect our business 
unanticipated developments in the law as well as changes in social and environmental conditions could potentially result in unexpected claims for coverage under our insurance and reinsurance contracts 
these developments and changes may adversely affect us  perhaps materially 
for example  we could be subject to developments that impose additional coverage obligations on us beyond our underwriting intent  or to increases in the number or size of claims to which we are subject 
with respect to our casualty businesses  these legal  social and environmental changes may not become apparent until some time after their occurrence 
our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by the increased willingness of some market participants to dispute insurance and reinsurance contract and policy wordings 
the full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under our coverages  and in particular our casualty reinsurance contracts  may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
our exposure to this uncertainty will grow as our long tail casualty businesses grow  because in these lines claims can typically be made for many years  making them more susceptible to these trends than our traditional catastrophe business  which is typically more short tail 
in addition  we could be adversely affected by the growing trend of plaintiffs targeting participants in the property liability insurance industry in purported class action litigation relating to claim handling and other practices 
although we are seeking to add professional staff and systems to improve our contracts and claims capabilities  we may fail to mitigate our exposure to these growing uncertainties 
pricing and terms for our products may decline  which could affect our profitability 
supply and demand for reinsurance and insurance depends on numerous factors  including the frequency and severity of catastrophic events  perceptions of risk  levels of capacity  general economic conditions and underwriting results of other insurers and reinsurers 
all of these factors fluctuate and may contribute to price declines generally in the reinsurance and insurance industries 
industry pricing has degraded in  and less catastrophe reinsurance business has met our hurdle rates than in prior years 
we expect premium rates and other terms and conditions of trade to vary in the future  and currently believe that overall industry pricing for many of our products will decline in if demand for our products falls or the supply of competing capacity rises  we expect our growth to be adversely affected  and our profitability could be affected as well 
in particular  we might lose existing customers or decline new business  which we might not regain when industry conditions improve 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
the reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with major us and us insurers and property catastrophe reinsurers  including other bermuda based property catastrophe reinsurers 
market participants continue to accumulate new capital  thereby strengthening their ability to compete 
in addition  hedge funds are increasing the overall capacity in the industry 
increased capacity levels have led to increased competition and have contributed to declines in overall industry pricing levels 
we believe that our principal competitors in the property catastrophe reinsurance market include other companies active in the bermuda market  including ace limited  everest re group ltd  ipc holdings  ltd  partnerre ltd 
and xl capital ltd 
we also compete with certain lloyd s syndicates active in the london market  as well as with a number of other industry participants  such as american international group  inc  berkshire hathaway  munich re group and swiss re 
in addition  there are other relatively new bermuda reinsurers with whom we compete  such as allied world assurance company  arch capital group  axis capital holdings  endurance specialty holdings  montpelier re holdings and platinum 
as our business evolves over time we expect our competitors to change as well 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
in addition  we may not be aware of other companies that may be planning to enter the property catastrophe reinsurance market or of existing companies which may be planning to raise additional capital 
we also have recently seen the creation of alternative products from capital market participants that are intended to compete with reinsurance products and which could impact the demand for traditional catastrophe reinsurance  as well as increased competitive activities from hedge funds 
we cannot predict what effect any of these developments may have on our businesses 
the businesses in which our individual risk unit operates are also highly competitive 
primary insurers compete on the basis of factors including distribution channels  product  price  service and financial strength 
many of our primary insurance competitors are larger and more established than we are and have greater financial resources and consumer recognition 
we seek primary insurance pricing that will result in adequate returns on the capital allocated to our primary insurance business 
we may lose primary insurance business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices 
bermuda could be subject to sanctions by a number of multinational organizations which could adversely affect bermuda companies 
a number of multinational organizations  including the european union  the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd  including its financial action task force  and the financial stability forum  have identified certain countries as blocking information exchange  engaging in harmful tax competition or not maintaining adequate controls to prevent corruption  such as money laundering activities 
recommendations to limit such harmful practices are under consideration by these organizations  and a report published on november  by the oecd contains an extensive discussion of specific recommendations 
the oecd has threatened non member jurisdictions that do not agree to cooperate with the oecd with punitive sanctions by oecd member countries 
it is unclear what these sanctions will be and if they will be imposed 
bermuda has committed to a course of action to enable compliance with the requirements of these multinational organizations  including signing a letter committing itself to eliminate harmful tax practices by the end of and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity 
however  the action taken by bermuda may not be sufficient to preclude all effects of the measures or sanctions described above  which if ultimately adopted could adversely affect bermuda companies such as us and our bermuda based subsidiaries 
political  regulatory and industry initiatives could adversely affect our business 
the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to heavy scrutiny by the us and individual state governments as well as an increasing number of international authorities 
government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies  including shareholders 
increasingly  governmental authorities in both the us and worldwide seem to us to be interested in the potential risks posed by the reinsurance industry as a whole  and to commercial and financial systems in general 
while we do not believe these inquiries have identified meaningful new risks posed by the reinsurance industry to the financial system or to policyholders  and we cannot predict the exact nature  timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives  we believe it is likely there will be increased regulatory intervention in our industry in the future 
for example  we could be adversely affected by proposals to

disproportionately benefit the companies of one country over those of another 
the growth of our primary insurance business  which is regulated more comprehensively than reinsurance  increases our exposure to adverse political  judicial and legal developments 
moreover  our exposure to potential regulatory initiatives could be heightened by the fact that our principal operating companies are domiciled in  and operate exclusively from  bermuda 
for example  bermuda  a small jurisdiction  may be disadvantaged in participating in global or cross border regulatory matters as compared with larger jurisdictions such as the us or the leading european union countries 
in addition  bermuda  which is currently an overseas territory of the united kingdom uk  may consider changes to its relationship with the uk in the future 
these changes could adversely affect bermuda s position in respect of future regulatory initiatives  which could impact us commercially 
a decline in our investment performance could reduce our profitability 
we derive a significant portion of our income from our invested assets 
as a result  our financial results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio  which contains fixed maturity securities  such as bonds and mortgage backed securities 
our operating results are subject to a variety of investment risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  foreign currency risk  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
additionally  with respect to certain of our investments  we are subject to pre payment or reinvestment risk 
the market value of our fixed maturity investments will be subject to fluctuation depending on changes in various factors  including prevailing interest rates 
as a result of large reinsurance or insurance losses  we may be forced to liquidate our investments at times and prices that are not optimal  which could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our investment portfolio 
increases in interest rates could cause the market value of our investment portfolio to decrease  perhaps substantially 
conversely  a decline in interest rates could reduce our investment yield  which would reduce our overall profitability 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
any measures we take that are intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment may not effectively mitigate such interest rate sensitivity 
in recent years we have increased our allocation to other investments which have different risk characteristics than our traditional fixed maturity securities and short term investment portfolios 
these other investments include hedge fund investments  a fund that invests in senior secured bank loans  a european high yield credit fund and private equity partnerships 
also included in other investments are investments in a medium term note  representing an interest in a pool of european fixed income securities  a non us dollar convertible fund and miscellaneous other investments 
our percentage allocation to these other investments will likely increase 
the performance of these other investments had a positive impact on the performance of our investment portfolio in these other investments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of certain of these investments is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments 
these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of the investments 
due to a lag in the valuations reported by the fund managers  the majority of our other investments are reported on a one month or one quarter lag 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes of the investments 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
these investments expose us to market risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk and credit risk 
we are unable to quantify these risks as we do not have timely access to the securities underlying each investment 
to the extent these risks move against us it could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance 
the performance of these investments is also dependent on the individual investment managers and the investment strategies 
it is possible that the investment managers will leave and or the investment strategies will become ineffective 
the result of either of the foregoing would be a material adverse change to our investment performance 
us taxing authorities could contend that our bermuda subsidiaries are subject to us corporate income tax 
if the us internal revenue service the irs were to contend successfully that renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci or top layer re is engaged in a trade or business in the us  renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci or top layer re would  to the extent not exempted from tax by the us bermuda income tax treaty  be subject to us corporate income tax on that portion of its net income treated as effectively connected with a us trade or business  as well as the us corporate branch profits tax 
although we would vigorously resist the imposition of any such tax  if we were ultimately held to be subject to this taxation  our earnings would correspondingly decline 
in addition  benefits of the us bermuda income tax treaty which may limit any such tax to income attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci or top layer re in the us are only available to any of renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci or top layer re if more than of its shares are beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  by individuals who are bermuda residents or us citizens or residents 
renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci or top layer re may not be able to continually satisfy such beneficial ownership test or be able to establish its satisfaction to the irs 
finally  it should be noted that it is unclear whether the income tax treaty assuming satisfaction of the beneficial ownership test applies to income other than premium income  such as investment income 
because we depend on a few reinsurance brokers for a large portion of revenue  loss of business provided by them could adversely affect us 
we market our reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through reinsurance brokers 
four brokerage firms accounted for  and  respectively  of our net premiums written for the years ended december   and subsidiaries and affiliates of marsh inc  the benfield group limited  the willis group and aon corporation accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our reinsurance segment gross written premiums in the loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by these brokers could have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to market our products could decline as a result of any loss of the business provided by these brokers and it is possible that our premiums written would decrease 
our reliance on reinsurance brokers exposes us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we pay virtually all amounts owed on claims under our policies to reinsurance brokers  and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts over to the insurers that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with us we refer to these insurers as ceding insurers 
likewise  premiums paid by ceding insurers are paid to brokers  who then pass such amounts on to us 
in many jurisdictions  if a broker were to fail to make such a payment to a ceding insurer  we would remain liable to the ceding insurer for the deficiency 
conversely  in many jurisdictions  when the ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to reinsurance brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid and the ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  in connection with the settlement of reinsurance balances  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world 
due to recent developments in the industry  we believe that the degree of this credit risk has increased 
a decline in the ratings assigned to our financial strength would adversely impact our business 
third party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength of reinsurers and insurers  such as renaissance reinsurance  our glencoe group carriers  top layer re and davinci 
these ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies 
periodically the rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us 
the financial strength ratings assigned by rating agencies to reinsurance or insurance companies are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
recently  certain rating agencies have placed us on credit watch with negative implications in connection with our restatement of our financial results for the years ended december   and see business recent developments 
the rating agencies may downgrade or withdraw their financial strength ratings in the future if we do not continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us 
our ability to compete with other reinsurers and insurers  and our results of operations  could be materially adversely affected by any such ratings downgrade 
for example  following a ratings downgrade we might lose clients to more highly rated competitors or retain a lower share of the business of our clients 
the rating of top layer re is dependent in large part upon the rating of state farm  who provides top layer re with billion of stop loss reinsurance 
as is customary in our industry  a portion of our reinsurance policies provide our clients with the right to cancel or not renew our policies in the event our financial strength ratings are downgraded 
we cannot precisely estimate the amount of premium that would be at risk to this development  as this amount depends on the particular facts and circumstances at the time  including the degree of the downgrade  the time elapsed on the impacted in force policies  and the effects of any related catastrophic event on the industry generally 
in the event any of these provisions are triggered  we will vigorously seek to retain our clients 
however  we cannot assure you that our premiums would not decline  perhaps materially  following a ratings downgrade 
we could be adversely affected if tria is not renewed 
in response to the tightening of supply in certain insurance and reinsurance markets resulting from  among other things  the september th tragedy  tria was enacted to ensure the availability of commercial insurance coverage for terrorist acts in the us this law established a federal assistance program through the end of to help the commercial property and casualty insurance industry cover claims related to future terrorism related losses and required that coverage for terrorist acts be offered by insurers 
it is possible that tria will not be renewed following  or could be adversely amended  which could adversely affect the insurance industry if a material subsequent event occurred 
given these uncertainties  we are currently unable to determine with certainty the impact that tria s non renewal could have on us 
the covenants in our debt agreements limit our financial and operational flexibility  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have incurred indebtedness  and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
at december   we had an aggregate of approximately million of indebtedness outstanding  consisting of million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due and a million bank loan incurred and fully drawn by our consolidated subsidiary  davincire holdings ltd 
davincire 
renaissancere is also party to a million syndicated revolving credit agreement  none of which was drawn at december  in addition  we have issued million aggregate liquidation amount of mandatorily redeemable capital securities capital securities through the capital trust holding solely million of the company s junior subordinated debentures due march  because we hold million of these securities and also hold million of equity interest in the capital trust  our net obligation is million 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries maintain letter of credit facilities in connection with their insurance and reinsurance business 
the largest of these is a secured letter of credit facility established under a reimbursement agreement entered into by certain of renaissancere s subsidiaries and affiliates 
the obligations of each of renaissancere s subsidiaries and affiliates party to the reimbursement agreement are secured by certain collateral  including cash  eligible high quality marketable securities and redeemable preference shares of rihl 
the facility currently is in the amount of million 
the term of the reimbursement agreement was extended to april  in november and in march  the reimbursement agreement was amended to conform certain default provisions of the agreement to comparable provisions in existing credit agreements of the company and davincire 
at december   the aggregate face amount of letters of credit outstanding under the reimbursement agreement was million and total letters of credit outstanding was million 
the agreements covering our indebtedness  particularly our bank loans  contain numerous covenants that limit our ability  among other things  to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  sell assets  merge or consolidate 
these agreements also require us to maintain specific financial ratios 
if we fail to comply with these covenants or meet these financial ratios  the lenders under our credit facilities could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them  cancel their commitments to lend or issue letters of credit  or both  and require us to pledge additional or a different type of collateral 
in addition  if we are in default under the junior subordinated debentures  discussed above  or if we have given notice of our intention to defer our related payment obligations  the terms of our indebtedness would  among other things  restrict our ability to

declare or pay any dividends on our capital shares  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
redeem  purchase or acquire any capital shares  or 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
make a liquidation payment with respect to our capital shares 
because we are a holding company  we are dependent on dividends and payments from our subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no direct operations  we rely on investment income  cash dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
the holding company does not have any operations and from time to time may not have significant liquid assets 
if our subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends to us  we may be unable to pay dividends or to repay our indebtedness 
bermuda law and regulations require our subsidiaries which are registered in bermuda as insurers to maintain a minimum solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio  and prohibit dividends that would result in a breach of these requirements 
further  renaissance reinsurance and davinci  as class insurers in bermuda  may not pay dividends which would exceed of their respective capital and surplus  unless they first make filings confirming that they meet the required margins 
as class insurers  glencoe  lantana and top layer re may not declare or pay dividends during any financial year that would cause glencoe  lantana or top layer re as the case may be to fail to meet its minimum solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio 
generally  our us insurance subsidiaries may only pay dividends out of earned surplus 
further  the amount payable without the prior approval of the applicable state insurance department is generally limited to the greater of of policyholders surplus or statutory capital  or of the subsidiary s prior year statutory net income 
since our us insurance subsidiaries earned surplus is negative  these subsidiaries cannot currently pay dividends without the applicable state insurance department approval 
the loss of one or more key executive officers could adversely affect us 
our success has depended  and will continue to depend  in substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officers 
if we were to lose the services of members of our senior management team  our business could be adversely affected 
for example  we might lose clients whose relationship depends in part on the service of a departing executive 
in addition  the loss of services of members of our management team would strain our ability to execute our growth initiatives  as described above 
our ability to execute our business strategy is dependent on our ability to attract and retain a staff of qualified underwriters and service personnel 
the location of our global headquarters in bermuda may impede our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
under bermuda law  non bermudians may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without the specific permission of the appropriate government authority 
the bermuda government will issue a work permit for a specific period of time  which may be extended upon showing that  after proper public advertisement  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian is available who meets the minimum standards for the advertised position 
substantially all of our officers are working in bermuda under work permits that will expire over the next three years 
the bermuda government could refuse to extend these work permits 
in addition  a bermuda government policy limits the duration of work permits to a total of six years  which is subject to certain exemptions only for key employees 
if any of our senior executive officers were not permitted to remain in bermuda  our operations could be disrupted and our financial performance could be adversely affected as a result 
regulatory challenges in the us or elsewhere to our bermuda operations claims of exemption from insurance regulation could restrict our ability to operate  increase our costs  or otherwise adversely impact us 
renaissance reinsurance  davinci and top layer re are not licensed or admitted in any jurisdiction except bermuda 
renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci and top layer re each conduct business only from their principal offices in bermuda and do not maintain an office in the us recently  the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework has been subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the us and various states within the us if our bermuda insurance or reinsurance operations become subject to the insurance laws of any state in the us  we could face inquiries or challenges to the future operations of these companies 
moreover  we could be put at a competitive disadvantage in the future with respect to competitors that are licensed and admitted in us jurisdictions 
among other things  jurisdictions in the us do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements unless security is posted 
our contracts generally require us to post a letter of credit or provide other security after a reinsured reports a claim 
in order to post these letters of credit  issuing banks generally require collateral 
it is possible that european union or other countries might adopt a similar regime in the future  or that the us rules could be altered in a way that treats bermuda disproportionately 
any such development could adversely affect us 
glencoe and lantana are currently eligible  non admitted excess and surplus lines insurers in  respectively  and states and territories of the us and are each subject to certain regulatory and reporting requirements of these states 
however  neither glencoe nor lantana is admitted or licensed in any us jurisdiction  moreover  glencoe only conducts business from bermuda 
accordingly  the scope of glencoe s and lantana s activities in the us is limited  which could adversely affect their ability to compete 
in addition  stonington  which writes insurance in all states on an admitted basis  is subject to extensive regulation under state statutes which confer regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers on state insurance commissioners 
such regulation generally is designed to protect policyholders rather than investors  and relates to such matters as rate setting  policy forms  limitations on dividends and transactions with affiliates  solvency standards which must be met and maintained  the licensing of insurers and their agents  the examination of the affairs of insurance companies  which includes periodic market conduct examinations by the regulatory authorities  annual and other reports  prepared on a statutory accounting basis  establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses  and requirements regarding numerous other matters 
we could be required to allocate considerable time and resources to comply with these requirements  and could be adversely affected if a regulatory authority believed we had failed to comply with applicable law or regulation 
we plan to grow stonington s business and  accordingly  expect our regulatory burden to increase 
our growth plans could cause one or more of our subsidiaries to become subject to additional regulation in other jurisdictions 
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business  and could also result in fines and other sanctions  any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results and operations 
retrocessional reinsurance may become unavailable on acceptable terms 
in order to limit the effect of large and multiple losses upon our financial condition  we buy reinsurance for our own account 
this type of insurance is known as retrocessional reinsurance 
our primary insurance companies also buy reinsurance from third parties 
a reinsurer s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance treaty with us could have a material adverse effect on us 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance  which they consider adequate for their business needs 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of retrocessional reinsurance 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain such retrocessional reinsurance  we may not be able to negotiate terms as favorable to us as in the past 
this could limit the amount of business we are willing to write  or decrease the protection available to us as a result of large loss events 
we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
a portion of our premium is written in currencies other than the us dollar and a portion of our claims and claim expense reserves are also in non dollar currencies 
moreover  we maintain a portion of our cash equivalent investments in currencies other than the us dollar 
although we generally seek to hedge significant non us dollar positions  we may  from time to time  experience losses resulting solely from fluctuations in the values of these foreign currencies  which could cause our consolidated earnings to decrease 
in addition  failure to manage our foreign currency exposures could cause our results to be more volatile 
consolidation in the insurance industry could adversely impact us 
we believe that many insurance industry participants are seeking to consolidate 
these consolidated entities may try to use their enhanced market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
if competitive pressures reduce our prices  we would expect to write less business 
as the insurance industry consolidates  competition for customers will become more intense and the importance of acquiring and properly servicing each customer will become greater 
we could incur greater expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention  further reducing our operating margins 
in addition  insurance companies that merge may be able to spread their risks across a consolidated  larger capital base so that they require less reinsurance 
we could also experience more robust competition from larger  better capitalized competitors 
we may encounter difficulties in maintaining the information technology systems necessary to run our business 
we believe our modeling  underwriting and information technology systems are critical to our business 
moreover  our proprietary technology has been an important part of our underwriting process and our ability to compete successfully 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will also continue to have access to these  or comparable  service providers  or that our proprietary technology will continue to operate as intended 
our business growth strategy will require further development of our technology infrastructure  and any defect or error in our information technology systems could result in reduced or delayed revenue growth  higher than expected losses  management distraction  or harm to our reputation 
some aspects of our corporate structure may discourage third party takeovers and other transactions or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
some provisions of our memorandum of association and of our amended and restated bye laws have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties or preventing the removal of our current board of directors and management 
in particular  our bye laws prohibit transfers of our capital shares if the transfer would result in a person owning or controlling shares that constitute or more of any class or series of our shares 
the primary purpose of this restriction is to reduce the likelihood that we will be deemed a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of the internal revenue code for us federal tax purposes 
however  this limit may also have the effect of deterring purchases of large blocks of common shares or proposals to acquire us  even if some or a majority of our shareholders might deem these purchases or acquisition proposals to be in their best interests 
in addition  our bye laws provide for

a large number of authorized but unissued shares which may be issued by the board without further shareholder action  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
a shareholder vote to amend  repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with several provisions of the bye laws 
these bye law provisions make it more difficult to acquire control of us by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
these provisions are designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our directors  which we believe would generally best serve the interests of our shareholders 
however  these provisions could have the effect of discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 
in addition  these bye law provisions could prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
to the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts  they could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price of the shares 
renaissancere indirectly owns stonington  stonington lloyd s and newstead 
our ownership of a us insurance company such as these can  under applicable state insurance company laws and regulations  delay or impede a change of control of renaissancere 
under applicable state insurance regulations  any proposed purchase of or more of our voting securities would require the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulatory authorities 
investors may have difficulties in serving process or enforcing judgments against us in the us we are a bermuda company 
in addition  certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the us all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the us investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the us on our directors and officers who reside outside the us or to recover against us or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws whether or not we appoint an agent in the us to receive service of process

reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits  including a reduction in net liability on individual risks and catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses 
reinsurance also provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more business than would be possible without a concomitant increase in capital and surplus  and facilitates the maintenance of acceptable financial ratios by the ceding company 
reinsurance does not legally discharge the primary insurer from its liability with respect to its obligations to the insured

retrocessional reinsurance  retrocessionaire 
spacer 
gif

reinsurance companies cede risks to retrocessionaires for reasons similar to those that cause primary insurers to purchase reinsurance to reduce net liability on individual risks  to protect against catastrophic losses  to stabilize financial ratios and to obtain additional underwriting capacity 
risk excess of loss reinsurance 
spacer 
gif 
a form of excess of loss reinsurance that covers a loss of the reinsured on a single risk in excess of its retention level of the type reinsured  rather than to aggregate losses for all covered risks  as does catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance

item legal proceedings our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject in the course of their business to claims litigation involving  among other things  disputed interpretations of policy coverages 
these lawsuits involving claims on policies issued by our subsidiaries which are typical to the insurance industry in general and in the normal course of business are considered in our claims and claim expense reserves which are addressed in the reserve for claims and claim expenses discussion 
in addition to claims litigation  we and our subsidiaries may be subject from time to time to lawsuits or regulatory actions that do not arise from or directly relate to claims on insurance policies 
this type of potential litigation could include  for example  allegations of underwriting errors or misconduct  employment claims  regulatory activity or disputes arising from our business ventures 
we are not currently subject to any litigation of this type whose impact is likely to be material to us 
we believe that over the next few years the ultimate outcomes of matters in this category of business litigation should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  future operating results or liquidity  although we believe that litigation of this nature will increase in the future  and it is possible that an adverse resolution of a number of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the years ended december  and december  the following also includes a discussion of our financial condition at december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this filing 
this filing contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from the results described or implied by these forward looking statements see note on forward looking statements 
overview renaissancere was established in to write property catastrophe reinsurance 
by pioneering the use of sophisticated computer models to construct our portfolio  we have become one of the world s largest and most successful catastrophe reinsurers 
recently  we have leveraged our expertise and established growing franchises in additional selected areas of insurance and reinsurance 
since a substantial portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man made catastrophes  our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of such catastrophic events  and the coverages we offer to clients impacted by these events 
currently  we conduct our business through two reportable segments  reinsurance and individual risk 
our revenues are principally derived from three sources net premiums earned from the reinsurance and insurance policies we sell  net investment income and realized gains and losses from the investment of our capital funds and the investment of the cash we receive on the policies which we sell  and other income received from our joint ventures and various other items 
our expenses primarily consist of net claims and claim expenses incurred on the policies of reinsurance and insurance we sell  acquisition costs which typically represent a percentage of the premiums we write  operational expenses which primarily consist of personnel expenses  rent and other operating expenses  and interest and dividend costs related to our debt  preference shares and subordinated obligation to our capital trust 
we are also subject to taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  however  since the majority of our income is currently earned in bermuda  a non taxable jurisdiction  the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal 
the operational results  also known as the underwriting results  of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its net claims and claim expense ratio  underwriting expense ratio  and combined ratio 
the net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by dividing net claims and claim expenses incurred by net premiums earned 
the underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses acquisition expenses and operational expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
a combined ratio below generally indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income 
a combined ratio over generally indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income 
we also discuss our net claims and claim expense ratio on an accident year basis 
this ratio is calculated by taking net claims and claim expenses  excluding development on net claims and claim expenses from events that took place in prior years  divided by net premiums earned 
modeling we have developed a proprietary  computer based pricing and exposure management system  renaissance exposure management system rems 
rems has analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each incremental reinsurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of reinsurance contracts 
before we bind any risk  exposure data is gathered from clients and this exposure data is input into rems modeling system 
the rems modeling system enables us to measure each policy on a consistent basis and provides us with a measurement of an appropriate price to charge for each policy based upon the risk that is assumed 
we combine the analyses generated by rems with other information available to us  including our own knowledge of the client submitting the proposed program 
while rems is most developed in analyzing catastrophe risks  it is also used for analyzing other classes of risk 
rems combines computer generated simulations that estimate event probabilities with exposure and coverage information on each client s reinsurance contract to produce an estimate of expected claims for reinsurance programs submitted to us 
we have also customized rems by including additional perils  risks and geographic areas that are not captured in the commercially available models 
restatement of financial statements as previously disclosed  in the fourth quarter of we engaged boies schiller to complete a review of the company s business practices in light of the industry wide investigations by the new york attorney general and other government authorities into a wide range of practices in the insurance and reinsurance industry 
supervision of this review was subsequently taken over by the board of directors  with boies schiller reporting directly to the independent members of the board of directors 
see business recent developments 
this review has led to the restatement of the company s audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   and to correct accounting errors associated with reinsurance ceded by the company 
these restatements arose out of the transactions described below 
certain of the restatement corrections are attributable to an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contract and an assignment agreement  each entered into by renaissance reinsurance with inter ocean in the aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contract initially provided for million of maximum limit over a three year period in exchange for annual premium of million 
this agreement was subsequently amended to provide for million of maximum limit for the same annual premium 
the assignment agreement provided for the sale by renaissance reinsurance to inter ocean of million face amount of reinsurance recoverables for million 
in prior financial statements  the company accounted for the aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contract as traditional reinsurance and for the assignment agreement as a sale of reinsurance recoverables 
in connection with the aforementioned review  the company concluded that these contracts  based on the totality of the surrounding facts and circumstances  should have been treated as a single transaction and  when so treated  lacked the necessary risk transfer to be accounted for as transactions involving ceded reinsurance and a sale of reinsurance recoverables 
the remaining restatement corrections are attributable to four multi year ceded reinsurance contracts 
the adjustments correct for an error in the amortization period resulting in the amortization of future contractual premium beginning at the end of the third quarter of rather than beginning at the end of the fourth quarter of the aggregate net effect of the corrections is to increase net income by million  to decrease net income by million  and to increase net income by million 
the amounts reflect the timing of the recognition of inter ocean reinsurance recoverables with the impact of decreasing net income by million in  decreasing net income by million in  and increasing net income by million in  and the timing of premium ceded on multi year contracts with the impact of increasing net income by million in  increasing net income by million in  and decreasing net income by million in 
these restatements only affect the reinsurance segment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the independent members of the board of directors  in connection with the aforementioned review  have concluded that certain members of senior management james n 
stanard  chief executive officer  william i 
riker  president  john m 
lummis  chief operating officer chief financial officer  michael w 
cash  senior vice president  and martin j 
merritt  controller made mistakes and in some instances lacked due care in connection with the original accounting for the inter ocean transactions that led to the restatement 
the independent members of the board of directors plan to discuss their findings directly with each of the aforementioned executives 
the independent members of the board of directors also concluded that  since  the company has made significant improvements in its internal controls  including controls over financial reporting 
these improvements include

designing and implementing controls related to accounting for complex reinsurance contracts  and 
spacer

developing training programs regarding the contractual features contained within reinsurance contracts that may require an accounting review in accordance with the company s policies and procedures 
during the last two fiscal years  the company has also formalized its internal control environment over financial reporting in connection with its compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates claims and claim expense reserves we believe that the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves 
claims reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
our estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors such as inflation 
it is likely that the ultimate liability will be greater or less than such estimates and that  at times  this variance will be material 
also  reserving for our reinsurance and individual risk businesses can involve uncertainty because of the dependence on information from ceding companies  the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us  and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid and incurred losses and may sometimes also include an estimate of incurred but not reported reserves ibnr 
for our property catastrophe reinsurance business  which is characterized by loss events of low frequency and high severity  reporting of claims in general tends to be prompt as compared to reporting of claims for long tail products  which tends to be slower 
however  the timing of claims reporting also varies depending on various factors  including whether the claims arise under reinsurance of primary companies or reinsurance of other reinsurance companies  the nature of the events eg  hurricanes or earthquakes  the geographic area involved  and the quality of each customer s claims management and reserving practices 
management s judgments as regards to these factors are reflected in management s reserve estimates 
because the events from which claims arise under policies written by our property catastrophe reinsurance business are typically prominent  public occurrences such as hurricanes and earthquakes  we are often able to use independent reports of such events to augment our loss reserve estimation process 
however  based upon the amount and timing of the reported claims from any one or more catastrophic event  such reserve estimates may change significantly from one quarter to another 
once we receive a notice of loss under a catastrophe reinsurance contract  we are generally able to process such claims promptly 
for our property catastrophe reinsurance operations  we initially set our claims reserves based on case reserves reported by insureds and ceding companies 
we then add to these case reserves our estimates for additional case reserves  and an estimate for ibnr 
in addition to the loss information and estimates communicated by cedants  we also utilize industry information which we gather and retain in our rems modeling system 
when property catastrophe losses do occur  the information stored in our rems modeling system enables us to analyze each of our policies against such loss and compare our estimate of the loss with those reported by our policyholders 
the rems modeling system also allows us to compare and analyze individual losses reported by policyholders affected by the same loss event 
although the rems modeling system assists with the analysis of the underlying loss  and provides us with the information and ability to perform increased analysis  the estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty associated with property catastrophe claims and the unique characteristics of each loss 
during  with the accumulation of years of historical information on our claims and claim expenses  we adopted a new system to reassess our property catastrophe reserves on our older accident years 
during our individual risk segment began issuing insurance policies for certain commercial liability coverages  including general  automobile and professional liability risks 
the claim reporting and claim development periods of these risks are generally expected to be longer than the reporting and development periods for our property risks  and accordingly there is normally greater uncertainty in the estimation of the reserves associated with these policies 
the loss estimation for the coverages we offer through our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations is different than that for property catastrophe oriented coverages because these coverages are potentially subject to greater uncertainties  relating to factors such as long term inflation and changes in the social and legal environment 
moreover  in reserving for our specialty reinsurance and individual risk coverages we do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in these lines 
we estimate our ibnr for these coverages by utilizing an actuarial method known as the bornhuetter ferguson technique 
the utilization of the bornhuetter ferguson technique requires us to estimate an ultimate claims and claim expense ratio and select an estimated loss reporting pattern 
we select our estimates of the ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and estimated loss reporting patterns by reviewing industry standards and adjusting these standards based upon the terms of the coverages we offer 
the estimated claims and claim expense ratio may be modified to the extent that reported losses at a given point in time differ from what would be expected based on the selected loss reporting pattern 
for the company s specialty and individual risk lines we also considered estimating reserves utilizing paid and incurred development methods 
we elected to utilize the bornhuetter ferguson technique because this method allows for weight to be applied to expected results  and hence is less susceptible to the potential pitfall of being excessively swayed by one year or one quarter of paid and or reported loss data 
the company s reserving methodology for each line of business  as discussed above  utilizes a loss reserving model that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate losses as opposed to a methodology that develops a range of estimates 
the company then utilizes this point estimate  along with paid and incurred data  to record its estimate of ibnr 
the company does not utilize sensitivity analysis in calculating reserves and therefore does not make any specific quantitative assumptions in connection with such an analysis 
see reserves for claims and claim expenses for a breakdown of our case reserves and ibnr by line of business 
because any reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our initial estimate of reserves 
therefore  because of these inherent uncertainties  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates 
in  assuming future reported and paid claims activity is consistent with that of recent quarters  and barring unforeseen circumstances  we believe that  as our reserves on older accident years continue to age  we may experience further reductions to our older accident year reserves 
all of our estimates are reviewed annually with an independent actuarial firm 
we also review certain assumptions and methodologies on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the quarter in which they are identified 
adjustments to our prior year estimated claims reserves will impact our current year net income by increasing our net income if the prior year estimated claims reserves are determined to be overstated  or by reducing our net income if the prior year estimated claims reserves prove to be insufficient 
during the years ended december   and  changes to prior year estimated claims reserves had the following impact for  prior year estimated claims reserves were reduced by million  for  prior year estimated claims reserves were reduced by million  and for  prior year estimated claims reserves were increased by million  and in each year there was a corresponding increase or decrease to net income 
although we believe we are cautious in our assumptions  and in the application of our methodologies  we cannot be certain that our ultimate payments will not vary  perhaps materially  from the estimates we have made 
also see reserves for claims and claim expenses 
losses recoverable we enter into reinsurance agreements in order to help reduce our exposure to large losses 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims and claim expense reserves associated with the underlying reinsured policies 
for multi year retrospectively rated contracts  we accrue amounts either assets or liabilities that are due to or from assuming companies based on estimated contract experience 
if we determine that adjustments to earlier estimates are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the quarter in which they are determined 
the estimate of losses recoverable can be more subjective than estimating the underlying claims and claim expense reserves as discussed under the heading claims and claim expense reserves above 
in particular  losses recoverable may be affected by deemed inuring reinsurance  industry losses reported by various statistical reporting services  and other factors 
in addition  the level of ibnr reserves has a significant impact on losses recoverable 
these factors can impact the amount of the losses recoverable to be recorded as well as delay the recognition of losses recoverable to reporting periods that are different from the underlying loss 
the amount of losses recoverable ultimately collected is also open to uncertainty due to insolvency  contractual dispute and various other reasons 
amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a valuation allowance that reduces losses recoverable and net income 
we estimate the valuation allowance by applying specific percentages against each losses recoverable balance based on the counterparty s credit rating 
the percentages applied are based on historical industry default statistics developed by major rating agencies and are then adjusted by us based on industry knowledge 
we also apply case specific valuation allowances against certain losses recoverables that we deem unlikely to be able to recover in full 
the valuation allowance against losses recoverable was million at december  million 
premiums we recognize premiums as revenue over the terms of the related contracts and policies 
our written premiums are based on policy and contract terms and include estimates based on information received from both insureds and ceding companies 
the information received is typically in the form of a bordereau  broker notifications and or discussions with ceding companies or their broker 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of written premium including adjustment and reinstatement premium  earned premium  acquisition costs and ceding commissions 
consistent with industry practice  we recognize premium on the date the contract is bound  even if the contract provides for an effective date prior to the date the contract is bound  thus preventing premature revenue recognition 
the date the contract is bound is the date we are on risk for the policy and this is generally the date on which the reinsurance slip is signed 
the signing of the reinsurance contract normally occurs after the date the slip is signed 
we book premiums on non proportional contracts in accordance with the contract terms 
premiums written on losses occurring contracts are typically earned over the contract period 
premiums on risks attaching contracts are generally earned as reported by the cedants  which may be over a period more than twice as long as the contract period 
for multi year policies  only the initial annual premium is included as written at policy inception 
the remaining annual premiums are included as written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 
management is required to make estimates based on judgment and historical experience for periods during which information has not yet been received 
in our individual risk business  it is often necessary to estimate portions of premiums written from quota share contracts and by program managers and the related commission expense 
management estimates these amounts based on discussions with ceding companies and program managers  together with historical experience and judgment 
total premiums written estimated in our individual risk business at december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the large accrual at december  was primarily due to one large contract where there was a delay in reporting actual figures to us and accordingly we accrued our best estimate of the premiums written as at december  on this contract 
at december   there was no such delay on this contract and accordingly there was a corresponding reduction in our year end premium accruals for our individual risk business 
total commissions estimated at december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
management tracks the actual premium received and commissions incurred and compares this to the estimates previously booked 
such estimates are subject to adjustment in subsequent periods when actual figures are recorded 
to date such subsequent adjustments have not been material 
since premiums for our reinsurance segment are contractually driven and the reporting lag for such premiums is minimal  estimates for premiums written for this segment are usually not significant 
the minimum and deposit premiums on excess policies are usually set forth in the language of the contract and are utilized to record premiums on these policies 
actual premiums are determined in subsequent periods based on actual exposures and any adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
reinstatement premiums are recorded after the occurrence of a loss and are calculated in accordance with the contract terms based upon paid losses and case reserves reported in the period 
reinstatement premiums are earned when written 
ceded premiums are also recognized on the date the contract is bound and are deducted from gross written premium  to arrive at net premiums written 
ceded premiums are earned over the terms of the related contracts and policies  and are reflected as a reduction to gross premiums earned to arrive at net premiums earned

represents premium ceded from the individual risk segment to the reinsurance segment 
summary overview our net income was million compared to net income of million in the substantial decline in net income results from the four large hurricanes  charley  frances  jeanne and ivan  that occurred during the third quarter of  which together caused a negative impact of million to our results 
this impact is reflected in the following items net losses of million  plus the reversal of previously accrued profit commission of million  which is reflected as an increase to acquisition expenses of the reinsurance segment  less reinstatement premiums earned of million and less minority interest offset of million 
these amounts are based on management s estimates following a review of our potential exposures and discussions with our counterparties 
given the magnitude of these loss events and due to delays in receiving claims data  these results are subject to change based on developments including new or revised data received from our counterparties 
additionally  depending on the ultimate level of the industry losses from these events  it is possible that in future periods additional recoveries from certain of our retrocessional coverages may be triggered and result in a reduction to our net losses from these events 
changes to these estimates will be recorded in the period in which they occur 
other significant items affecting net income include a reduction of prior years estimated ultimate net claims reserves of million  an increase in investment income of million  and reductions in net realized gains on investments of million 
the reduction in prior years estimated ultimate net claims reserves was primarily due to a re estimation of our ultimate losses associated with six large catastrophe events  which produced a reduction of approximately million  a million reduction in reserves from numerous smaller catastrophe events  million in reductions from our specialty book of business  and million in reductions from our individual risk book of business 
the reductions in our reserves for the smaller catastrophe events  the reserves for the specialty book of business and the reserves for our individual risk book of business were driven by the application of our formulaic reserving methodology used for these books of business and is primarily due to the actual paid and reported loss activity being better than what we had anticipated when setting the initial ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and the initial loss reporting patterns 
the increase in investment income was largely due to million of income and appreciation related to investments in hedge funds  private equity funds and other alternative investments recorded during compared to million recorded during the increase in investment income and appreciation was due to both higher returns and a greater level of investment in these other investments in compared to our net income increased to million in from million in  primarily due to an increase in our net premiums earned of million and an increase in net realized gains on investments of million 
the increase in net premiums earned was primarily due to improved market conditions associated with the dislocation which occurred after the world trade center disaster  and the significant losses stemming from this event 
these losses caused an imbalance in the supply and demand for our insurance and reinsurance products  and as a result  we increased our written premiums  in both our established property catastrophe line and our specialty reinsurance line  and also increased our premiums in our individual risk operations 
contributing to the increase in individual risk operations during was the continued growth of our program manager distribution channel  where we write primary insurance through specialized program managers  and our quota share reinsurance distribution channel  where we write quota share reinsurance with primary insurers see below for underwriting results by segment 
also  net income for was positively affected by a reduction of prior years estimated ultimate net claims reserves of million and by a reduced level of catastrophe loss events occurring in underwriting results by segment we conduct our business through two reportable segments  reinsurance and individual risk 
our reinsurance segment provides reinsurance through our catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance business units and through ventures 
our individual risk segment provides primary insurance and quota share reinsurance 
our underwriting results by segment are provided below reinsurance segment our reinsurance operations are comprised of three business units property catastrophe reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  specialty reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  and certain activities of ventures

excludes combined premium assumed from the individual risk segment of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
premiums property catastrophe the million increase in property catastrophe premiums was mainly due to reinstatement premiums of million and premiums for back up covers of million written as a result of the third quarter hurricanes 
excluding these premiums  which in the absence of a major catastrophe we would not expect to recur  our property catastrophe premiums declined slightly from during our consolidated property catastrophe premiums remained flat  primarily due to increased competition and due to some softening of prices in the market  where we accordingly chose not to renew certain policies 
during  we are currently anticipating a decline in our property catastrophe premiums 
see current outlook for additional disclosure 
specialty reinsurance during and our consolidated specialty reinsurance written premiums increased by million and million  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to our continued focus on a few targeted areas of this market where we believe we can leverage our expertise  including surety  casualty  property and terrorism specific classes of reinsurance 
the areas representing the majority of the increase were catastrophe exposed workers compensation and terrorism specific reinsurance 
during  we currently expect our specialty reinsurance premium to grow modestly 
however  our expectations for this business remain prone to potential volatility as this business is characterized by a relatively small number of large transactions

because of the potential volatility of the property catastrophe reinsurance business  we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to large losses 
we use our rems modeling system to evaluate how each purchase interacts with our portfolio of reinsurance contracts we write  and with the other ceded reinsurance contracts we purchase  to determine the appropriateness of the pricing of each contract 
during and  we reduced the level of reinsurance purchased because of the reduction in the availability of appropriately priced coverages 
although we would remain liable to the extent that any of our reinsurers fail to pay our claims  before placing reinsurance we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers 
at december   the majority of the million of net losses recoverable relates to outstanding claims reserves on our books as distinguished from claims that we have already paid  and  in accordance with the terms of the policies  we generally must wait to collect from our reinsurers until we pay the underlying claims 
we expect to collect the recorded net balance of the losses recoverable 
to the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available  we anticipate continued use of reinsurance to reduce the potential volatility of our results 
underwriting results the underwriting results for the reinsurance segment decreased to million of underwriting income  compared to underwriting income of million in the significant decline is primarily attributable to the million negative impact from the four large hurricanes that occurred during the third quarter 
this impact is reflected in the following items net losses of million  plus the reversal of previously accrued profit commission of million  which is reflected as an increase to acquisition expenses of the reinsurance segment  less reinstatement premiums earned of million 
because we do not include minority interest in our summary of underwriting income in the table above  the million referred to above does not reflect the million offset for the minority interest of the shareholders of davincire  which  when considered  would result in the net million total effect to the reinsurance segment 
offsetting the effect of the hurricanes above was a reduction of prior years estimated ultimate net claims reserves of million 
the reduction in prior years estimated ultimate net claims reserves was primarily due to a re estimation of our ultimate losses associated with six large catastrophe events  which produced a reduction of approximately million  a million reduction in reserves from numerous smaller catastrophe events  and million in reductions from our specialty book of business 
the reductions in our reserves for the smaller catastrophe events and the reserves for the specialty book of business were driven by the application of our formulaic reserving methodology used for these books of business and were primarily due to the actual paid and reported loss activity being better than what we had anticipated when estimating the initial ultimate claims and claims expense ratios and the initial loss reporting patterns 
the increase in our net underwriting income from our reinsurance segment  compared to  was primarily the result of three factors the comparably low level of property catastrophe losses during which reduced our net claims and claim expenses by approximately million  favorable development on prior period reserves which contributed million of a reduction in net claims and claim expenses  and the increase in our net reinsurance premiums earned during  as a result of our increase in gross written property catastrophe premiums in and the increase in our gross written specialty reinsurance premiums in and losses from our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance policies can be infrequent  but severe  as demonstrated in the variation of our results during as compared to and during periods with benign property catastrophe loss activity  such as and  we have the potential to produce a low level of losses and a related increase in underwriting income 
also during and  as discussed under the premiums heading above  we have continued to increase our specialty reinsurance premiums written 
this increase in specialty reinsurance premiums will normally produce higher net claims and claim expenses than the property catastrophe reinsurance business which will generally cause the combined ratio of our reinsurance segment to increase in years with normal cat loss activity 
our underwriting expenses consist of acquisition expenses and operational expenses 
acquisition expenses consist of costs to acquire premiums and are principally comprised of broker commissions and excise taxes 
acquisition expenses are driven by contract terms and are normally a set percentage of premiums and  accordingly  these costs will normally fluctuate in line with the fluctuation in premiums 
operational expenses consist of salaries and other general and administrative expenses 
our reinsurance business operates with a limited number of employees and we have the ability to grow our written premiums without proportionally increasing our operating expenses 
the decrease in our operational expenses in by million was primarily due to a reduction of million in executive compensation and bonus and incentive compensation due to changes in the compensation structure of certain executives and also due to the reduction in underwriting profit in see capital resources below 
the increase in underwriting expenses during was primarily due to an increase in acquisition costs on our specialty reinsurance business  which is attributable to commission costs related to certain quota share premiums written in which typically carry higher acquisition costs than our excess of loss contracts 
we have entered into joint ventures and specialized quota share cessions of our book of business 
in accordance with the joint venture and quota share agreements  we are entitled to certain fee income and profit commissions 
we record these fees and profit commissions as a reduction in acquisition expenses or operating expenses and  accordingly  these fees have also contributed to the reduction in our expense ratio 
during  given the magnitude of the hurricane losses of and due to delays in receiving claims data and the likelihood of receiving new or revised data from our counterparties  the estimates of hurricane losses and related recoveries are likely to change 
changes in these estimates will be recorded in the period in which they occur 
also during  as discussed in our critical accounting policies  because our reserve estimate is simply our estimate of our ultimate liability  and since there are numerous factors which affect reserves but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our initial estimate of reserves 
in response to these inherent uncertainties  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates 
accordingly  if actual paid losses and incurred losses reported to us are below those utilized to establish initial ibnr reserves  we would reflect positive development in our prior year reserves  as has occurred in our and results 
during  assuming future reported and paid net claims activity is consistent with that of recent quarters  and barring unforeseen circumstances  we believe that  as our reserves on older accident years continue to age  we may experience further reductions to our older accident year reserves 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will occur  and if our actual paid and incurred losses exceed our estimates  we would instead reflect adverse rather than positive development 
individual risk segment we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the exposure characteristics of the original underlying insurance policy 
our principal products include commercial and homeowners property coverages  including catastrophe exposed lines  commercial liability coverages  including general  automobile  professional and various specialty lines  and reinsurance to other insurers on a quota share basis 
we operate through the glencoe group of companies  whose principal operating subsidiaries are glencoe  stonington and lantana

premiums the increase in gross premiums written from our individual risk operations of million in was primarily the result of our addition of new programs and expansion of existing programs compared to the prior year 
the growth in individual risk premiums is below our expectations due to later inceptions of certain programs than previously anticipated 
the increase in our premiums from our individual risk operations in was as a result of an improving market environment due primarily to the increase in demand for insurance and reinsurance protection  and the withdrawal of supply  as a result of the substantial losses stemming from the world trade center disaster in  the ongoing increase to prior year reserves for many companies with asbestos and environmental liabilities  and the continuing increases to prior year reserves for companies who participated in the casualty market of the late s 
as a result of these items  many insurance companies in the us withdrew from the us insurance market  and many insurance companies had their credit ratings substantially reduced 
in response to these dislocations  we received numerous opportunities to partner with program managers who were looking for high quality  stable companies with which to do business 
also  because of our financial strength and our strong ratings  we received increasing opportunities to work with existing insurance companies on a quota share basis 
during  we expect that certain new programs will incept in the first half of the year 
assuming we are correct  and assuming our estimate for growth in other existing areas of the individual risk business is also correct  we expect gross written premium growth for this segment to grow significantly in ceded premiums written

we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to large losses 
with the continued growth in the gross written premiums of our individual risk segment  we continued to look for opportunities to purchase appropriately priced reinsurance coverage 
underwriting results the underwriting results for the individual risk segment decreased to an underwriting loss of million  compared to underwriting income of million in the significant decline is primarily attributable to the million of negative impact from the four large hurricanes that occurred during the third quarter 
this impact is reflected in the following items net losses of million plus reinstatement premiums ceded of million 
offsetting the effect of the hurricanes above was a reduction of prior years estimated ultimate net claims reserves of million

our underwriting expenses consist of acquisition expenses and operational expenses 
acquisition expenses consist of costs to acquire premiums and are comprised of fees and expenses paid to program managers  who source primary insurance premiums for us through specialized programs  primary insurers  with whom we write quota share reinsurance  and broker commissions and excise taxes paid to brokers  who source insurance for us on a risk by risk basis 
acquisition expenses are driven by contract terms and are generally determined based on a set percentage of premiums 
operational expenses consist of compensation and other general and administrative expenses 
our individual risk business operates with a limited number of employees and  accordingly  we outsource much of the administration of our individual risk business to program managers and third party administrators 
during we began issuing insurance policies for certain commercial liability coverages  including general  automobile and professional liability risks 
the claim reporting and claim development periods of these risks are longer than the reporting and development periods for our property risks  and accordingly there is normally greater uncertainty in the estimation of the reserves associated with these policies 
during  given the magnitude of the hurricane losses of and due to delays in receiving claims data and the likelihood of receiving new or revised data from our counterparties  the estimates of hurricane losses and related recoveries are likely to change 
changes in these estimates will be recorded in the period in which they occur

the increase in other items primarily reflects the recording of million in unrealized gains on the platinum warrant  which was recorded in the income statement at fair value commencing in the fourth quarter of as the result of the expiration of a lockup provision  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
this was partially offset by million of losses recognized by the company from short positions in credit derivatives generally used to hedge potential credit related exposures of the company 
the increase in equity in earnings of other ventures was primarily due to million of equity pickup from our investment in channel re  which incepted in during  the majority of our equity in earnings of other ventures was generated from our equity ownership in top layer re 
the increase in fee income during was primarily due to the million annual fee we receive related to services provided to platinum 
the reduction in other items is primarily related to the derivative income we received in related to derivative instruments under which recoveries are triggered by an industry loss index or geological or physical variables  which did not repeat in corporate expenses

during  our us operations did not generate taxable income and  accordingly  we increased the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset by million so that our valuation allowance is now equal to our net deferred tax asset 
during and we wrote a limited amount of business in our us operations and therefore the related tax impact for and was minimal 
we currently plan to continue to increase the business written by our us tax paying insurance subsidiaries 
if  as a result  our us operations begin to generate taxable income  the appropriateness of the valuation allowance will be reassessed and  accordingly  potential profits from our us operations would possibly not have a corresponding offset for tax expenses  up to the million valuation allowance recorded at december  net realized gains on investments

our investment portfolio is structured to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity 
a large majority of our investments are invested in the fixed income markets and  therefore  our realized holding gains and losses on investments are highly correlated to fluctuations in interest rates 
therefore  as interest rates decline  we will tend to have realized gains from the turnover of our investment portfolio  and as interest rates increase  we will tend to have realized losses from the turnover of our investment portfolio  although the actual amount of realized gains losses on sales of investments can be reduced depending on which specific securities we choose to sell 
the amount of the realized gains or realized losses that will be recorded in the future will be dependent upon the level of our investments  the changes in the interest rate environment and how quickly or slowly we choose to turn over our investment portfolio 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle goodwill effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas 
in the second quarter of  the company completed its initial impairment review in compliance with the transition provisions of fas and  as a result  the company decided to record goodwill at zero value  the low end of an estimated range of values  and wrote off the balance of its goodwill during the second quarter of  which totaled million 
in accordance with the provisions of fas  this is required to be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income and is required to be recorded retroactive to january  financial condition renaissancere is a holding company  and we therefore rely on dividends from our subsidiaries and investment income to make principal and interest payments on our debt and capital securities  and to make dividend payments to our preference and common shareholders 
the payment of dividends by our bermuda subsidiaries is  under certain circumstances  limited under us statutory regulations and bermuda insurance law  which require our bermuda insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of our bermuda insurance subsidiaries was billion  and the amount of capital and surplus required to be maintained was million 
during  renaissance reinsurance  davinci and glencoe declared aggregate cash dividends of million  million and million  respectively  compared with million  million and  respectively  in our us insurance subsidiary stonington is also required to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
this is determined using risk based capital tests  which determines the threshold that constitutes the authorized control level 
if stonington s statutory capital and surplus falls below the authorized control level  the commissioner is authorized to take whatever regulatory actions are considered necessary to protect policyholders and creditors 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of stonington was million 
because of the accumulated deficit in earned surplus from prior operations  stonington currently cannot pay an ordinary dividend 
in the aggregate  our operating subsidiaries have historically produced sufficient cash flows to meet their expected claims payments and operational expenses and to provide dividend payments to us 
our subsidiaries also maintain a concentration of investments in high quality liquid securities  which management believes will provide additional liquidity for extraordinary claims payments should the need arise 
additionally  we maintain a million revolving credit facility to meet additional liquidity and capital requirements  if necessary 
cash flows cash flows from operating activities for were million  which principally consisted of net income of million prior to dividends on preference shares  plus million for increases to net reserves for claims and claim expenses 
the cash flows from operations were primarily used to increase the investment portfolio  including fixed income securities  other investments and investments in other ventures 
we have generated cash flows from operations in  and significantly in excess of our operating commitments 
because a large portion of the coverages we provide typically can produce losses of high severity and low frequency  it is not possible to accurately predict our future cash flows from operating activities 
as a consequence  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years

case reserves include our estimate of case reserves for insurance policies  case reserves reported by our counterparties for reinsurance contracts  and additional case reserves for reinsurance contracts  which represent additional case reserves established by management 
of the total case reserve amounts above  the amount reported by ceding insurers and insureds was million at december  and million at december  the remaining balance represents additional case reserve estimates established by management 
at december   our total gross reserves for claims and claim expenses was  million and our estimated ibnr reserves were million 
a change in such ibnr reserves would equate to a million adjustment to net claims and claim expenses incurred  which would represent of our net income and of shareholders equity at december  as discussed in the summary of critical accounting policies and estimates  the most significant accounting judgment made by management is the estimation of the claims and claim expense reserves 
because of the variability and uncertainty associated with loss estimation  it is possible that our individual case reserves are incorrect  possibly materially 
a large portion of our coverages provide protection from natural and man made catastrophes which are generally infrequent  but can be significant  such as losses from hurricanes and earthquakes 
our claims and claim expense reserves will generally fluctuate  sometimes materially  based upon the occurrence of a significant natural or man made catastrophic loss for which we provide reinsurance 
our claims reserves will also fluctuate based on the payments we make for these large loss events 
the timing of our payments on loss events can be affected by the event causing the loss  the location of the loss  and whether our losses are from policies with insurers or reinsurers 
during and we increased our specialty reinsurance and individual risk gross written premiums see premiums 
the addition of these lines of business adds complexity to our claims reserving process and therefore adds uncertainty to our claims reserve estimates as the reporting of information  the setting of initial reserves and the loss settlement process for these lines of business vary from our traditional property catastrophe line of business 
for our reinsurance and individual risk operations  our estimates of claims reserves include case reserves reported to us as well as our estimate of appropriate additional case reserves and ibnr 
our case reserves  additional case reserves  and our estimates for ibnr reserves are based on claims reports from insureds and program managers  our underwriters experience in setting claims reserves  the use of computer models where applicable  and historical industry claims experience 
for some classes of business we also use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate ultimate expected claims and claim expenses 
we review our claims reserves on a regular basis

during  our capital resources increased primarily as a result of three items our net income available to common shareholders of million  the issuance of million of series c preference shares  and an increase in our revolving credit facility by million 
in march  we raised million through the issuance of million series c preference shares  in february  we raised million through the issuance of million series b preference shares  and in november  we raised million through the issuance of million series a preference shares 
the series c  series b and series a preference shares may be redeemed at per share at our option on or after march   february  and november   respectively  however  we have no current intentions to redeem the shares 
dividends on the series c  series b and series a preference shares are cumulative from the date of original issuance and are payable quarterly in arrears at  and  respectively  when  if  and as declared by the board of directors 
if renaissancere submits a proposal to our shareholders concerning an amalgamation or submits any proposal that  as a result of any changes to bermuda law  requires approval of the holders of renaissancere preference shares to vote as a single class  renaissancere may redeem the series c  series b and series a preference shares prior to march   february  and november   respectively  at per share 
the preference shares have no stated maturity and are not convertible into any other of our securities 
in january  we issued million of senior notes due february   with interest on the notes payable on february and august of each year  commencing august  in july  we issued million of senior notes due july  with interest on the notes payable on january and july of each year 
the notes can be redeemed by us prior to maturity subject to payment of a make whole premium  however  we have no current intentions of calling the notes 
the notes  which are senior obligations  contain various covenants  including limitations on mergers and consolidations  restrictions as to the disposition of stock of designated subsidiaries and limitations on liens on the stock of designated subsidiaries 
renaissancere was in compliance with the related covenants at december  and our capital trust has issued capital securities which pay cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of  payable semi annually 
during and  renaissancere did not purchase any of the capital securities 
renaissancere has purchased an aggregate million of the capital securities since their issuance in the sole asset of the capital trust consists of our junior subordinated debentures 
the indenture relating to these junior subordinated debentures contains certain covenants  including a covenant prohibiting us from the payment of dividends if we are in default under the indenture 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the indenture at december  and the capital securities mature on march  effective december   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no

fin requires consolidation of all variable interest entities vie by the investor that will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or residual returns 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the capital trust was determined to be a vie under fin and the company has been determined not to be the primary beneficiary of the capital trust 
accordingly  the capital trust has been deconsolidated effective december  as a result  the accounts of the capital trust  principally the capital securities previously classified as minority interest  are not included in our consolidated balance sheet at december  or our million subordinated obligation to the capital trust  previously eliminated in consolidation  is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at december  and as a liability

the amended and restated agreement extended the term of the facility to may  under the terms of certain reinsurance contracts  our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and joint ventures may be required to provide letters of credit to reinsureds in respect of reported claims and or unearned premiums 
our principal letter of credit facility is a syndicated secured facility which accepts as collateral shares issued by our subsidiary rihl 
our participating operating subsidiaries and our managed joint ventures have pledged and must maintain rihl shares issued to them with a sufficient collateral value to support their respective obligations under the facility  including reimbursement obligations for outstanding letters of credit 
the participating subsidiaries and joint ventures also have the option to post alternative forms of collateral 
in addition  for liquidity purposes  in order to be permitted to pledge rihl shares as collateral  each participating subsidiary and joint venture must maintain additional unpledged rihl shares that have a net asset value at least equal to of its facility usage  and rihl shares having an aggregate net asset value equal to at least of the net asset value of all outstanding rihl shares must remain unencumbered 
in the case of a default under the facility  or in other circumstances in which the rights of our lenders to collect on their collateral may be impaired  the lenders may exercise certain remedies under the facility agreement  in accordance with and subject to its terms  including redemption of pledged shares and conversion of the collateral into cash or eligible marketable securities 
the redemption of shares by the collateral agent takes priority over any pending redemption of unpledged shares by us or other holders 
between january and november  this facility was increased to billion from million  and as of january   the facility was reduced to million 
in november  the term of this facility was extended through april  and in march  the reimbursement agreement was amended to conform certain default provisions of the agreement to comparable provisions in existing credit agreements of the company and davincire 
subject to certain conditions  the size of the facility may be increased to billion 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit under the facility aggregating million 
our subsidiary stonington has provided a letter of credit in the amount of million to one counterparty which is secured by cash and eligible marketable securities 
also  in connection with our top layer re joint venture  we have committed million of collateral to support a letter of credit and are obligated to make a mandatory capital contribution of up to million in the event that a loss reduces top layer re s capital below a specified level 
during august  we amended and restated our committed revolving credit agreement to increase the facility from million to million  to extend the term to august  and to make certain other changes 
the interest rates on this facility are based on a spread above libor 
no balance was outstanding at december  or as amended  the agreement contains certain financial covenants

in august  the board authorized a share repurchase program of million 
this authorization includes the remaining amounts available under prior authorizations 
no shares were repurchased during or under this program 
in the future  we may purchase shares under our current authorization  or increase the size of our repurchase program

the million growth in our portfolio of invested assets for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net cash provided by operating activities of million and the issuance of million series c preference shares  partially offset by dividends to common and preference shareholders of million and million  respectively 
because our coverages include substantial protection for damages resulting from natural and man made catastrophes  we may become liable for substantial claim payments on short notice 
accordingly  our investment portfolio is structured to preserve capital and provide a high level of liquidity 
the large majority of our investment portfolio consists of highly rated fixed income securities  including us treasuries  highly rated sovereign and supranational securities  high grade corporate securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
at december   our invested asset portfolio of fixed maturities and short term investments had a dollar weighted average rating of aa aa  an average duration of years years and an average yield to maturity of 
as noted in our discussion of our cash flows above  our future cash flows from operations will be negatively impacted by losses we will be required to pay related to the recent third quarter hurricanes 
the equity investments in reinsurance company relate to our november  purchase of  common shares of platinum in a private placement transaction 
in addition  we received a ten year warrant to purchase up to million additional common shares of platinum for per share 
we purchased the common shares and warrant for an aggregate price of million 
at december   we owned exclusive of the warrant of platinum s outstanding common shares 
we have recorded our investment in platinum at fair value  and at december  the aggregate fair value was million million 
the fair value of the common shares is based on the market price of platinum s shares as of the balance sheet date 
the fair value of the warrant is estimated by the company using the black scholes option pricing model 
the aggregate unrealized gain on the platinum common shares of million million is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
during the fourth quarter of  a lockup provision on the warrant expired and as a result the warrant met the definition of a derivative under fas and therefore changes in the fair value of the warrant were recorded prospectively in other income from november  at december   million was recorded in other income representing the unrealized gain on the warrant 
this includes a million one time reclassification from other comprehensive income to other income which occurred during the fourth quarter of with the million remainder being the increase in fair value from november at december   the aggregate unrealized gain on the platinum warrant was million which was included in other comprehensive income 
at december   million million of cash and cash equivalents and investments were invested in currencies other than the us dollar  which represented of our cash and cash equivalents and invested assets 
a portion of our investment assets is directly held by our subsidiary rihl  a bermuda company we organized for the primary purpose of holding the investments in high quality marketable securities for renaissancere  our operating subsidiaries and certain of our joint venture affiliates 
we believe that rihl permits us to consolidate and substantially facilitate our investment management operations 
renaissancere and each of our participating operating subsidiaries and affiliates have transferred to rihl marketable securities or other assets  in return for a subscription of rihl equity interests 
each rihl share is redeemable by the subscribing companies for cash or in marketable securities 
over time  the subsidiaries and joint ventures which participate in rihl are expected to both subscribe for additional shares and redeem outstanding shares  as our and their respective liquidity needs change

fair values of certain of the other investments noted above are generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of the investments 
these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit the company s ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
due to a lag in the valuations reported by the fund managers  the majority of our hedge fund and private equity partnership valuations are reported on a one month or one quarter lag 
interest income  income distributions and realized and unrealized gains and losses on other investments are included in net investment income and totaled million million of which million million was related to net unrealized gains 
the hedge funds are engaged in various investment strategies  including event driven  diversified arbitrage  distressed  us long short  global long short and sector long short with original capital contributed by us  generally in the range of million to million per fund  although we have committed to invest up to million in one hedge fund 
the loan fund primarily invests in senior secured floating rate loans 
the european high yield credit fund is denominated in euros and primarily invests in unlisted and listed fixed and floating rate debt securities issued by entities that are domiciled in or have a substantial portion of their total assets or operations in a european country 
the private equity partnerships are primarily engaged in us private equity  real estate  distressed securities and secondary investment strategies with initial capital commitments ranging from million to million  although we have committed to invest up to million in one partnership 
the medium term note was issued by an investment company which invests predominantly in investment grade european fixed income securities and passes through a variable us dollar return on the note based on the performance of the underlying securities 
the non us convertible fund is denominated in euros and primarily invests in unlisted and listed non us convertible securities 
included in miscellaneous other investments are catastrophe bonds  that generally include variable rate notes where the return is contingent upon climatical or geological events 
we have committed capital to private equity partnerships of million  of which million has been contributed at december  non indemnity index transactions we have assumed risk through securities and derivative instruments under which losses could be triggered by an industry loss index or geological or physical variables

effects of inflation the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the anticipated effects on us are considered in our catastrophe loss models 
the effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses

fas r replaces fasb statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation fas and supersedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
the statement requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted to employees and is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  because fas r must be applied not only to new awards but also to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date  and because we adopted fas using the prospective transition method which applied only to awards granted  modified or settled after the adoption date  compensation costs for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under fas will be recognized under fas r 
we estimate that the additional compensation expense related to unvested grants that were issued prior to january  will not be material upon adoption of fas r 
had we adopted fas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of fas as described in the transitional disclosure provisions of fasb statement no

current outlook we currently anticipate the following developments in our business reinsurance segment since  there has been an increase in the number of traditional reinsurance companies dedicating capital to the property catastrophe reinsurance market 
this increase  combined with more recent capital additions from newer  non traditional market participants  has resulted in an excess of supply over demand in certain sectors of the market and  correspondingly  has caused deterioration in pricing and in terms and conditions 
therefore  we expect that a growing number of transactions will not meet our hurdle rates and we estimate that our property catastrophe reinsurance premium will decline during we also note that during  we recorded million of reinstatement premiums and million of premiums on back up covers related to the third quarter florida hurricanes 
if there is an absence of similar catastrophic events during  we anticipate that such premiums will not recur and  therefore  the decline in property catastrophe reinsurance premiums in will be more pronounced 
we are currently seeing some softening in the specialty reinsurance market  however  due to the strength of our organization and our relationships with both our brokers and our customers  we believe there are still adequate opportunities for us to grow this line of business modestly during our premiums from this line of business are attributable to a relatively small number of large deals and the amount of the premiums can fluctuate significantly between quarters and between years depending upon the number of  and nature of  the transactions that we complete 
individual risk segment during  we expect to see continued softening in the commercial property markets 
we also expect additional program manager relationships to come on line during based upon this  we expect our premiums from our individual risk segment to grow significantly in new business we believe that the current market environment may create more opportunities for the creation of joint ventures and strategic investments 
we have established renaissancere ventures ltd 
to facilitate strategic investments 
in evaluating joint ventures and strategic investments  we may consider opportunities in other areas of the insurance and reinsurance markets  or in other financial markets  either through organic growth  the formation of new joint ventures  or the acquisition of other companies or books of business of other companies 
we are currently in the process of reviewing certain opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible transactions  although there can be no assurance that we will complete any such transactions or that any such transaction would contribute materially to our results of operations or financial condition

we caution the reader that the information provided above related to estimated future payment dates of our reserves for claims and claim expenses is not prepared or utilized for internal purposes and that we currently do not estimate the future payment dates of claims and claim expenses 
because of the nature of the coverages that we provide  the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our policy liabilities will fluctuate  perhaps significantly  and therefore are highly uncertain 
in order to estimate the payment dates of our contractual obligations for our reserve for claims and claim expense  we have utilized the work of an outside consulting actuarial firm

this firm has based their estimate of future claim payments upon benchmark payment patterns constructed internally by their firm  drawing upon available relevant sources of loss and allocated loss adjustment expense development data 
these benchmarks are revised periodically as new trends emerge 
it is likely that this benchmark data will not be predictive of our future claim payments and that material fluctuations can occur due to the nature of the losses which we insure and the coverages which we provide 
in certain circumstances many of our contractual obligations may be accelerated to dates other than those reflected in the table  due to defaults under the agreements governing those obligations including pursuant to cross default provisions in such agreements or in connection with certain changes in control of the company  if applicable 
in addition  in connection with any such default under the agreement governing these obligations  in certain circumstances these obligations may bear an increased interest rate or be subject to penalties as a result of such a default

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are principally exposed to four types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk  and credit risk 
the company s investment guidelines permit  subject to approval  investments in derivative instruments such as futures  options  foreign currency forward contracts and swap agreements  which may be used to assume risks or for hedging purposes 
interest rate risk our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity investments available for sale and short term investments  whose market values will fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
we attempt to maintain adequate liquidity in our fixed maturities investment portfolio to fund operations  pay reinsurance and insurance liabilities and claims and provide funding for unexpected events 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk by monitoring the duration and structure of our investment portfolio 
the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease in market value of  which equated to a decrease in market value of approximately million on a portfolio valued at  million at december  at december   the decrease in market value would have been  which equated to a decrease in market value of approximately million on a portfolio valued at  million 
the foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time horizon  since this presents the worst case scenario 
credit spreads are assumed to remain constant in these hypothetical examples 
foreign currency risk our functional currency is the us dollar 
we write a substantial portion of our business in currencies other than us dollars and may  from time to time  experience exchange gains and losses and incur underwriting losses in currencies other than us dollars  which will in turn affect our consolidated financial statements 
our foreign currency policy with regard to our underwriting operations is generally to hold foreign currency assets  including cash  investments and receivables that approximate the foreign currency liabilities  including claims and claim expense reserves and reinsurance balances payable 
when necessary  the company will use foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with our underwriting operations 
as of december   the company had notional exposure of million nil related to foreign currency forward and option contracts purchased 
for our investment operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations through our investments in non us dollar bonds and euro denominated fixed income funds 
as of december   our combined investment in these bonds and funds was million 
to hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations from these funds  we have entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts with notional exposure of million 
in the future  we may choose to increase our exposure to non dollar investments 
foreign exchange gains or losses arising from certain non us dollar investments are recorded in other comprehensive income or realized gains losses  the foreign exchange gains losses associated with our hedging of these non us dollar assets are recorded through foreign exchange gains losses in our statements of income 
our foreign currency and option contracts are recorded at fair value  which is determined principally by obtaining quotes from independent dealers and counterparties 
the fair value of these contracts as of december  was a loss of million nil 
all changes in exchange rates are recognized currently in our statements of income 
equity risk we are exposed to equity price risk principally due to our investment in the common shares and warrant to purchase additional common shares of platinum see summary of results of operations for  and other investments  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value 
the risk is the potential for loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in the price of platinum s common stock 
the aggregate fair value of this investment in platinum was million at december  compared to million at december  a hypothetical percent decline in the price of platinum stock  holding all other factors constant  would have resulted in a million decline in the fair value of the stock and a million decline in the fair value of the warrant assuming no other changes to the inputs to the black scholes option valuation model that we use 
the decline in the fair value of the stock would be recorded in net unrealized gains losses on securities and included in other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the decline in the fair value of the warrant would be recorded in other income 
we are also indirectly exposed to equity market risk through our investments in some hedge funds that have net long equity positions  and private equity partnerships whose exit strategies often depend on the equity markets 
such investments totaled million at december  million 
credit risk our exposure to credit risk is primarily due to our fixed maturity investments available for sale and short term investments  and to a lesser extent  reinsurance premiums receivable and ceded reinsurance balances 
at december  and  our invested asset portfolio had a dollar weighted average rating of aa 
from time to time we purchase credit default swaps to hedge our exposures in the insurance industry and to assist in managing the credit risk associated with ceded reinsurance 
at december   the maximum payments we were obligated to make under credit default swaps was million million 
we account for these credit derivatives at fair value and record them on our consolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities depending on the rights or obligations 
the fair value of these credit derivatives  as recognized in other liabilities in our balance sheet  at december  was a liability of million million 
during  we recorded losses of million million in our consolidated statement of income  including the million liability on the balance sheet at december  million 
the fair value of the credit derivatives are determined using industry valuation models 
the fair value of these credit derivatives can change based on a variety of factors including changes in credit spreads  default rates and recovery rates  the correlation of credit risk between the referenced credit and the counterparty  and market rate inputs such as interest rates
