overview core molding technologies is a compounder of sheet molding composite smc and molder of fiberglass reinforced plastics 
core molding technologies produces high quality fiberglass reinforced molded products and smc materials for varied markets  including light  medium and heavy duty trucks  automobiles and automotive aftermarkets  personal watercraft and other commercial products 
the demand for core molding technologies products is affected by economic conditions in the united states  canada and mexico 
core molding technologies manufacturing operations have a significant fixed cost component 
accordingly  during periods of changing demands  the profitability of core molding technologies operations may change proportionately more than revenues from operations 
on december   core molding technologies acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of columbus plastics  a wholly owned operating unit of international s truck manufacturing division since its formation in late columbus plastics  located in columbus  ohio  was a compounder and compression molder of smc 
in  core molding technologies began compression molding operations at its second facility in gaffney  south carolina  and in october  core molding technologies acquired certain assets of airshield corporation 
as a result of this acquisition  core molding technologies expanded its fiberglass molding capabilities to include the spray up  hand lay up and vacuum assisted resin infusion molding processes 
in september  core molding technologies acquired substantially all the operating assets of keystone restyling products  inc  a privately held manufacturer and distributor of fiberglass reinforced products for the automotive aftermarket industry 
results of operations compared with net sales for totaled  an approximate increase from the  reported for included in total sales are tooling project revenues of  for and  for tooling project revenues are sporadic in nature and do not represent a recurring trend 
total product sales revenue  excluding tooling project revenue  was higher by approximately for the year ended as compared to the year ended the primary reason for this increase was due to the positive impact general economic conditions have had on the demand for medium and heavy duty trucks 
sales to international totaled  an approximate increase from the amount of  the primary reason for the increase was due to the positive impact of general economic conditions and the affect on product sales 
tooling sales to international were approximately lower in as compared to sales to yamaha in amounted to  which was slightly higher than the  in sales to freightliner totaled  for  which was an increase of approximately from the  for the primary reason for the increase was due to the reason noted above and having the full impact for the year of products that went into production in the first and second quarter of sales to other customers increased by approximately to  from  in the increase in sales was primarily due to the positive impact general economic conditions have had on the demand for medium and heavy duty trucks  as well as the addition of new customers at core molding technologies matamoros facility 
gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales in the increase in gross margin  as a percentage of sales from the prior year  was due to a combination of many factors 
the primary reason for the increase was due to the increase in sales volume  which enabled the company to better absorb its fixed costs of production 
the benefit gained by the increase in sales volume was partially offset by additional costs incurred as a result of increases in raw material costs  primarily due to price increases for resin  which is a significant component of smc 
due to the cost of crude oil and natural gas  raw material prices have increased and are expected to continue to rise into also offsetting the benefit gained were inefficiencies related to material usage and the nine day strike at the company s columbus plant  as well as increases in the company s profit sharing accruals resulting from improved operating results 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  in  which was greater than the  incurred in the increase from was primarily due to increases in professional fees and outside services and the company s profit sharing accruals resulting from improved operating results 
interest expense totaled  for decreasing from  in the primary reason for the decrease was due to the refinancing of long term debt with international truck and engine corporation in december interest rates experienced by the company with respect to the industrial revenue bond were favorable  however  due to the interest rate swap the company entered into  the interest rate is essentially fixed for this debt instrument 
income tax expense for was approximately of total income before taxes 
the company s normal tax rate is  however  the company decreased its valuation reserve related to its tax operating loss carryforwards 
this reserve was reduced by  as a result of the company anticipating it being more likely than not that the company will realize these benefits 
actual tax payments will be lower than the recorded expenses as the company has substantial federal tax loss carryforwards 
these loss carryforwards were recorded as a deferred tax asset 
as the tax loss carryforwards are utilized to offset federal income tax payments  the company reduces the deferred tax asset as opposed to recording a reduction in income tax expense 
net income for was  or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share  representing an increase of  from the net income of  or 
per basic and diluted share 
compared with net sales for totaled  an approximate decrease from the  reported for included in total sales are tooling project revenues of  for and  for tooling project revenues are sporadic in nature and do not represent a recurring trend 
sales to international totaled  an approximate increase from the amount of  the primary reason for the increase was due to revenue from completed tooling projects 
sales to yamaha in amounted to  which was slightly higher than the  in sales to lear for totaled  an approximate decrease from the amount of  the primary reason for the decrease was due to lower tooling project revenues of  this decrease was mitigated by an increase in product sales of  primarily due to new business that began in sales to freightliner totaled  for  which was a decrease of approximately from the  for the primary reason for the decrease was due to reduced demand for molded product 
sales to other customers decreased by approximately to  from  in this decrease was primarily the result of decreased tooling project revenue 
gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales in the increase in gross margin was primarily due to a combination of many factors including improvements in material costs  labor efficiency and repairs and maintenance costs at the company s columbus  ohio facility 
this increase in gross margin was partially offset by reduced margins at the company s gaffney  south carolina facility primarily due to operational inefficiencies that occurred throughout the year 
also impacting the gaffney facility s gross margin was premium freight costs incurred in the fourth quarter of to meet a customer production schedule 
gross margins from the operations acquired in the airshield asset acquisition were generally in line with its previous results 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  in  which was greater than the  incurred in the increase from was primarily due to increases in the company s insurance by  and travel expenses by  interest expense totaled  for decreasing from  in the primary reason for the decrease was due to the principal payment on the note payable due to international that was made in the first quarter of interest rates experienced by the company with respect to the industrial revenue bond were favorable  however  due to the interest rate swap the company entered into  the interest rate is essentially fixed for this debt instrument 
interest income totaled  for  decreasing from  for primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate earned on investments 
income tax expense for was approximately of total income before taxes 
actual tax payments will be lower than the recorded expenses as the company has substantial federal tax loss carryforwards 
these loss carryforwards were recorded as a deferred tax asset 
as the tax loss carryforwards are utilized to offset federal income tax payments  the company reduces the deferred tax asset as opposed to recording a reduction in income tax expense 
net income for was  or

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary cash requirements are for operating expenses and capital expenditures 
these cash requirements have historically been met through a combination of cash flow from operations  equipment leasing  issuance of industrial revenue bonds and bank lines of credit 
cash provided by operating activities in totaled  net income increased operating cash flows by  non cash deductions of depreciation and amortization added  to positive operating cash flow 
also adding to positive operating cash flow was an increase in accounts payable of  due to timing differences 
in addition  the increase in the postretirement healthcare benefits liability of  is not a current cash obligation  and this item will not be a cash obligation until retirees begin to utilize their retirement medical benefits 
partially offsetting the above mentioned increases in operating cash flows were increases in accounts receivable of  which is primarily related to increased sales volume  and inventories of  which is a result of increased production to meet current sales volume 
cash used for investing activities was  for the year ended december  capital expenditures totaled  which was primarily related to the acquisition of machinery and equipment 
at december   commitments for capital expenditures in progress were  capital expenditures for are expected to be  primarily related to the acquisition of machinery and equipment 
investing cash flows were also used for the purchase of substantially all of the assets of keystone restyling products  inc for  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financing activities reduced cash flow by  due to regularly scheduled payments on the secured note payable of  and on the industrial revenue bond of  at december   the company had cash on hand of  and an available line of credit of  line of credit  which is scheduled to mature on april  management expects these resources to be adequate to meet core molding technologies liquidity needs 
as of december   the company was in compliance with its two financial debt covenants for the line of credit and letter of credit securing the industrial revenue bond and certain equipment leases 
the covenants relate to maintaining certain financial ratios 
management expects core molding technologies to meet these covenants for the year however  if a material adverse change in the financial position of core molding technologies should occur  core molding technologies liquidity and ability to obtain further financing to fund future operating and capital requirements could be negatively impacted 
the company has the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  including purchase obligations  as defined by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on the company s balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
based on this definition  the tables below include only those contracts  which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
the following table provides aggregated information about contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  and after total debt      interest      operating lease obligations      contractual commitments for capital expenditures   postretirement benefits      total      interest is calculated based on adjusting the variable interest rate to the effective interest rate due to the swap agreements in place for both long term borrowings 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  post retirement benefits  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december  management also records estimates for customer returns  discounts offered to customers  and for price adjustments 
should customer returns  discounts  and price adjustments fluctuate from the estimated amounts  additional allowances may be required 
the company has reduced accounts receivable for chargebacks of  at december  and  at december  inventories inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories are accounted for using the first in  first out fifo method of determining inventory costs 
inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based on historical and anticipated usage 
goodwill and long lived assets management evaluates whether impairment exists for goodwill and long lived assets 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine impairment  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  decreases in future cash flows from operating activities below the assumptions could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to recover its long lived assets 
the company has not recorded any impairment to goodwill for long lived assets for the years ended december  and post retirement benefits management records an accrual for postretirement costs associated with the health care plan sponsored by core molding technologies 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine the reserves  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  increases in future healthcare costs above the assumptions could have an adverse effect on core molding technologies operations 
the effect of a change in healthcare costs is described in note of the consolidated notes to financial statements 
core molding technologies recorded a liability for postretirement healthcare benefits based on actuarially computed estimates of  at december   and  at december  in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb staff issued fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
core molding technologies adopted the provisions of the act in the third quarter of the adoption of the provisions of the act increased net income for the year ended december  by  income taxes management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance and the amount of the valuation allowance recorded 
the valuation allowance will be adjusted as the company determines the actual amount of deferred tax assets that will be realized 
the company had recorded a valuation allowance of at december  and  at december  in the fourth quarter of  the company eliminated this valuation allowance due to anticipating it being more likely than not that the company will realize these benefits 
the deferred tax asset of  at december   primarily includes the tax benefits associated with cumulative net operating losses of approximately  temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the company s property and equipment of approximately  and temporary differences relating to post retirement and pension benefits of an analysis is performed to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset that will be realized 
such analysis is based upon the premise that the company is and will continue as a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of the company using a number of alternatives to evaluate financial results in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
other factors considered are the company s relationships with its three largest customers international  freightliner and yamaha  and the company s recent customer diversification efforts and the refinancing of notes payable at a lower interest rate 
the projected availability of taxable income to realize the tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of temporary differences before expiration of these benefits are also considered 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies and the maintenance of its relationships with its key customers  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of  inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
due to the cost of crude oil and natural gas  raw material prices have increased and are expected to continue to rise in these increases could have a significant impact on the future results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage and also requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement but believes it will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued revised sfas no 
 share based payment which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement  which requires the cost of all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements  establishes fair value as the measurement objective and requires entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions 
the statement applies to all awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after july  and unvested portions of previously issued and outstanding awards 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk core molding technologies primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
core molding technologies is also exposed to changes in the price of commodities used in its manufacturing operations and foreign currency fluctuations associated with the mexican peso 
core molding technologies does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
core molding technologies has the following five items that are sensitive to market risks industrial revenue bond irb with a variable interest rate 
core molding technologies has an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at  revolving line of credit  which bears a variable interest rate  bank note payable with a variable interest rate 
core molding technologies entered into a swap agreement effective january   to fix the interest rate at  foreign currency purchases in which core molding technologies purchases mexican pesos with united states dollars to meet certain obligations that arise due to the facility located in mexico  and raw material purchases in which core molding technologies purchases various resins for use in production 
the prices of these resins are affected by the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as processing capacity versus demand 
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  core molding technologies would be impacted by an increase in raw material costs  which would have an adverse effect on operating margins 
assuming a hypothetical change in short term interest rates in both and  interest expense would not change significantly  as the interest rate swap agreement would generally offset the impact and the use of core molding technologies revolving line of credit was not material during
