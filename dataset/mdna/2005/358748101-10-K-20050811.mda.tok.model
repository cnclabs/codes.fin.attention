the presentation of the consolidated statement of earnings was substantially revised beginning with the filing of the form q for the third quarter of fiscal corresponding reclassifications to last year s results have been made to conform to the current year presentation 
the company believes the revisions enhance the presentation by adding the measures of gross profit and operating profit

the new agreement expands the range of the golden corral network  including entry into the states of pennsylvania  west virginia and michigan

all of the above items are discussed in greater detail in the discussion of results of operation that follows

results of operation sales the company s sales are primarily generated through the operation of big boy restaurants and golden corral restaurants 
big boy sales also include wholesale sales from the company s commissary to restaurants licensed to other big boy operators and the sale of certain products to grocery stores 
changes in sales occur when new restaurants are opened and older restaurants are closed 
same store sales comparisons are a key metric that management uses in the operation of the business 
same store sales are affected by changes in customer counts and menu price increases

year fiscal fiscal fiscal marked the eighth consecutive year that big boy same store sales increases have been achieved  which includes of the last quarters 
customer counts were lower throughout fiscal  with the largest decline of percent occurring in the fourth quarter 
for the year  customer counts were percent lower than the prior year 
higher average guest checks driven by menu price increases were enough to offset the lower customer counts 
the same store sales comparisons include average menu price increases of percent  percent  and percent  respectively  during the third quarters of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal the first quarters of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal included average menu price increases of percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
another price increase will be implemented in late summer continued high gasoline prices throughout are believed to be one cause of the lower customer count  as the higher cost to fill up a tank leaves less money to spend on a restaurant meal 
the remainder of the big boy sales increases was achieved on the combination of more restaurants in operation and higher wholesale sales 
wholesale sales increased significantly in fiscal the higher wholesale sales are attributed to a licensed operator of sixteen big boy restaurants in the toledo  ohio market that began purchasing food from the company s commissary 

table of contents the company operated big boy restaurants as of may   including one that opened in august and another that re opened in september that had been closed for rebuilding since may one older  low volume big boy restaurant was closed in november  and another store was temporarily closed for rebuilding in april over the next twelve months one new store is planned  the rebuilding of the store closed in april will be completed  and another building will be constructed to relocate an existing operation caused by an eminent domain proceeding 
golden corral sales increases are the result of additional restaurants in operation fiscal fiscal fiscal in operation at beginning of year opened during the year in operation at end of year total sales weeks during year three golden corral restaurants were under construction as of may  and a fourth was started in early fiscal scheduled openings for these stores are in june  august  october and november the june opening marked the company s first store in the state of pennsylvania  and in november the first store in west virginia will open 
two additional restaurants will begin construction during fiscal golden corral same store sales decreased percent during fiscal there have been seven consecutive quarters of golden corral same store sales declines 
higher average guest checks have not overcome the effect of the continuing decline in customer counts  which were down percent for fiscal while some of the declines can be traced to the sister store effect of building additional restaurants in existing markets to achieve market penetration  management is actively seeking to identify and solve other factors that are apparently contributing to the decline 
the last menu price increases were percent in may  percent in may  and percent in november customer count decreases by quarter in fiscal were percent in the first quarter  and then percent  percent and percent in the succeeding quarters

year fiscal fiscal following general industry practice  the same store sales comparisons include only those restaurants that were open for five full fiscal quarters prior to the start of the comparison periods 
this removes possible misleading numbers that can be caused by the great influx of customers during the first several months of operation  sometimes called the honeymoon period of a new restaurant 
using this formula  twenty of the restaurants were included in the annualized fiscal same store sales calculation

the table supplements the discussion that follows concerning cost of sales for both the big boy and golden corral reporting segments  including food cost  payroll and other operating costs 
total bb gc total bb gc total bb gc sales food and paper payroll and related other operating costs including opening costs gross profit the higher food and paper cost percentages shown in the table for both big boy and golden corral for both fiscal and fiscal are the result of escalating commodity costs  especially beef  dairy and pork 
beef  in particular  continues to be a highly volatile market 
import and export restrictions can cause wide fluctuations in cost 
the food and paper cost percentages for the golden corral segment are much higher than the big boy segment because of the all you can eat nature of the golden corral concept  as well as its use of steak as a featured item on the buffet 
the company believes commodity prices will continue to rise for the foreseeable future and management is resolved to manage the business around that fact 
menu price hikes have helped to counter the effects of the higher cost of food to a certain degree  however  menu prices can not be raised high enough at once to offset the significant increases that have been seen on a wide range of products 
the effect of commodity price increases is actively managed with changes to the big boy menu mix and effective selection of items served on the golden corral food bar 
the company historically reviewed self insured claims experience each quarter  with a comprehensive review performed during the first quarter of each year 
at that time the reserves were usually reduced to more closely reflect claims experience 
the company has been able to significantly reduce its reserves in recent years because the combination of active management of claims and post accident drug testing has produced improved claims experience by lowering both the number of claims and the average cost per claim 
because of these trends  the company undertook a comprehensive review of claims experience during the third quarter of fiscal and determined a favorable adjustment to the reserves of  was warranted 
comprehensive reviews are now conducted each quarter with adjustments to the reserves recorded as needed 
an adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal brought total favorable adjustments recorded in fiscal to  favorable adjustments included in fiscal were  and in fiscal they totaled  
table of contents vigorous concentration by management to contain payroll costs resulted in a decline in payroll and related cost percentages in fiscal for both the big boy and golden corral operating segment 
when the benefit of the self insured workers compensation reserve adjustments discussed in the preceding paragraph that were apportioned to payroll and related costs is excluded  all percentages still moved lower 
these reductions were achieved in spite of higher costs for medical insurance and the continuing high charges for pension related costs 
the big boy same store sales increases helped the big boy payroll percentages while average pay rates remained level with no appreciable change in hours worked during fiscal golden corral s percentages moved downward during fiscal despite the decline in same store sales 
the lower golden corral percentages were achieved with a significant reduction in the number of hours worked while pay rates were roughly even with last year 
increases in big boy revenues  control of labor hours at the golden corrals  and relatively flat labor rates were also primary causes of the reduction in labor costs between fiscal and fiscal although congressional efforts continually mount to raise the federal minimum wage  the company believes that it is unlikely that federal legislation to do so will be enacted in the near term 
however  if such legislation were enacted  the company would counter the effects with higher menu prices  together with tighter payroll standards and a reduction in the number of hours that employees would be permitted to work 
new overtime rules initiated by the us department of labor went into effect in august the new rules had a negligible impact on the company 
escalating pension costs have been experienced the past three years  as a result of poor returns during the first part of the current decade on equity investments held by the company s defined benefit pension plans 
net periodic pension cost computed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
r was   and  respectively  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to compute pension cost has remained at percent despite poor returns cited above  as the return assumptions are based on long term objectives 
the weighted average discount rate used in the actuarial assumptions for projected benefit obligations was reduced to percent for fiscal  and the rate of compensation increase for projected benefit obligations was reduced to percent 
company contributions to these plans were   and  respectively  during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal contributions in fiscal include  from the previous year and do not include  that will be contributed to the plans after may  other operating costs include occupancy costs such as maintenance  rent  depreciation  property tax  insurance and utilities  field supervision  accounting and payroll preparation costs  franchise fees for golden corral restaurants  opening costs and many other restaurant operating expenses 
most of these expenses tend to be more fixed in nature  and same store sales increases cause these costs to be a lower percentage of sales  as reflected in the above table for big boy 
the big boy percentages for fiscal and fiscal were lower than fiscal due to the same store sales increase in both years  combined with certain write offs recorded in fiscal for the cost of abandoning design plans for an earlier big boy prototype building 
opening costs had a significant impact on the percentages as well 
charges for big boy restaurants for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
golden corral opening costs for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
operating expense in fiscal was also adversely impacted by a  charge to correct the company s accounting for leases to conform the recognition of rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  including any option periods considered to be part of the lease term  as lease terms are defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases  as amended 
sfas also defines the term of the lease as including the period of time when no rent is paid to the landlord  often referred to as a rent holiday  that generally occurs while a restaurant is being built on leased land 
a total of  in under accrued rent holidays was capitalized during fiscal in conforming the recognition of rent to sfas a number of restaurant chains  retailers  and similar companies utilizing leased facilities have recently recorded similar charges for lease accounting issues 
this charge reduced diluted eps by

gains and losses on sale of assets are then respectively added or subtracted 
administrative and advertising expense increased  during fiscal  or percent compared to fiscal these costs increased  or percent between fiscal and fiscal the largest component 
table of contents of the increase in all three years is higher spending for advertising and marketing programs that is proportionate with higher sales levels  reflecting the company s long standing policy to spend a constant percentage of big boy and golden corral sales on advertising and marketing 
advertising expense was   and  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
also having an impact on administrative and advertising expense for fiscal are  in costs to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act  principally related to higher external auditing fees 
other factors contributing to the higher expense for fiscal included increased litigation costs and a one time charge to recognize an obligation to an environmental remediation plan on a piece of property the company no longer owns 
revenue from franchise fees is based on sales of big boy restaurants that are franchised to other operators 
the fees are based principally on percentages of sales generated by the licensed restaurants 
as of may   big boy restaurants had been franchised to others 
other revenue also includes certain other fees from franchisees along with miscellaneous rent and investment income 
gains and losses on sale of assets consist of transactions involving real property and sometimes may include restaurant equipment that is sold together with real property as a package when closed restaurants are sold 
gains and losses reported on this line do not include abandonment losses that often arise when certain equipment is replaced before it reaches the end of its expected life 
abandonment losses are instead reported in other operating costs 
amounts reported for fiscal and fiscal primarily represent gains from the sale of undeveloped land 
the  gain recorded in fiscal was from the sale of a big boy restaurant that was permanently closed in fiscal results for fiscal were favorably affected by a gain on the early termination of a lease amounting to  that resulted from the disposition of a former big boy restaurant 
the credit reflected the over estimation of lease charges recorded when the restaurant was permanently closed in fiscal no impairments of assets were recorded in during any of the three years ended may  other expense income interest expense increased  in fiscal  or percent higher than fiscal the increase was caused by the combination of higher debt levels for most of the year  higher interest rates and lower levels of capitalized interest 
life insurance proceeds were used to retire  of outstanding debt in march  providing some relief in interest expense in the fourth quarter of the year 
interest expense in fiscal decreased  or percent from fiscal accounting for much of the change is the effect of interest required to be capitalized  which was  in fiscal and  in fiscal capitalized interest in fiscal was  reduction in the weighted average fixed interest rate also caused a portion of the decrease between fiscal and fiscal in addition to interest expense  the  non taxable life insurance benefit is classified as other expense income  and is not included in the determination of operating profit 
income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal  and percent in fiscal the fiscal income tax expense percentage was favorably affected by the  gain from non taxable life insurance benefit 
the effective rate for fiscal would have been percent without the advantage of the non taxable life insurance benefit 
the effective rates have been kept consistently low through the company s use of available tax credits  principally the federal credit allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips 
to a lesser degree  the company also uses the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc 
liquidity and capital resources sources of funds sales to restaurant customers provide the company s principal source of cash 
the funds from sales are immediately available for the company s use  as substantially all sales to restaurant customers are received in cash or are settled by credit cards 
net earnings plus depreciation provide the primary source of cash provided by operating activities 
other sources of cash may include borrowing against the company s credit lines  proceeds from employees exercising of stock options and occasional sales of real estate 
in addition to servicing debt  these cash flows are utilized for discretionary objectives  including capital projects principally restaurant expansion and dividends 

table of contents working capital practices the company has historically maintained a strategic negative working capital position  a common practice in the restaurant industry 
as significant cash flows are consistently provided by operations  and credit lines are readily available  the use of this practice should not hinder the company s ability to satisfactorily retire any of its obligations when due  including the aggregated contractual obligations and commercial commitments shown in the following table 
aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of may  payments due by period in thousands more than years total year year year year year long term debt       rent due under capital lease obligations  rent due under operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations   other long term obligations  total contractual cash obligations    not included in the table is a contingent liability for the performance of a ground lease that has been assigned to a third party 
the annual obligation of the lease approximates  through should the third party default  the company has the right to re assign the lease 
operating leases include option periods considered to be part of the lease term under sfas  as amended 
primarily consists of commitments for capital projects plus certain food and beverage items 
deferred compensation liability 
the working capital deficit was  as of may  the deficit was  as of may  the working capital deficit is likely to continue increasing over the next few years at a modest  manageable pace as construction debt is prudently increased to supplement the use of internally generated cash to finance expansion plans 
including draws since may    remains available to be drawn upon a construction draw credit facility before it is scheduled to expire on september   unless extended 
additionally  a  working capital revolving line of credit currently unused is readily available if needed 
operating activities operating cash flows were  in fiscal   lower than fiscal and  below fiscal the fiscal decrease is attributable to normal changes in assets and liabilities 
however  management believes a better  more reliable gauge to measure cash flows from the operation of the business is to use the simple method of net earnings plus depreciation 
eliminating the life insurance benefit  this method yielded  in cash flows for fiscal  an increase of  above fiscal and  higher than fiscal 
table of contents investing activities capital spending is the principal component of investing activities 
capital spending was  during fiscal  a decrease of  from fiscal this year s capital spending includes  for golden corral restaurants  principally for new restaurant construction and site acquisitions  plus the costs to remodel five of the original restaurants constructed in and big boy capital expenditures were  in fiscal  consisting of new restaurant construction  remodeling existing restaurants  routine equipment replacements and other capital outlays

the settlement was with the architect and the architect s structural engineering consultant 
receipt of the settlement funds was sufficient to recover all construction costs incurred  including the cost to raze the defective building 
the company continues to vigorously prosecute its claim exceeding  against the general contractor that built the building 
financing activities borrowing against credit lines amounted to  during fiscal another  was borrowed shortly after the year ended

the company s stock repurchase program expired october  it had authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
no shares were acquired during the two year life of the program  as the price at which shares of the company s common stock had been traded did not warrant utilization of the program 
other information the company reached a new development agreement with golden corral franchising systems  inc in july the new agreement added golden corrals subsequently expanded to to the development schedule  bringing the total to restaurants to be in operation by december  the development agreement  which had called for five restaurants to be opened each calendar year through december with the final four scheduled for  was modified in june to permit the opening of only three restaurants in the company asked for the modification in order to use cash flow and credit facilities in a debt neutral manner 
in no way does the modification change the company s intention to complete the build out schedule by december  as of may   golden corral restaurants were in operation with three restaurants under construction 
costs remaining to complete construction of these three restaurants were estimated at  as of may  construction of a fourth restaurant was started in june 
on average  the cost to build and equip each golden corral restaurant is approximately  including land 
one big boy restaurant was under construction as of may  and is planned to open in august as of may   the estimated cost remaining to complete the project was  this building is a replacement building on a same site as the prior building 
two additional buildings are likely to be constructed during the next twelve months 
one of the new buildings involves a relocation caused by a state highway project in indiana  while the other involves a new restaurant 
the approximate cost to build and equip a new big boy restaurant ranges from 
table of contents  to  depending on land cost 
approximately one fifth of the company s big boy restaurants are routinely renovated or decoratively updated each year at an average cost of  per restaurant 
in addition  certain high volume big boy restaurants are regularly evaluated to determine whether their kitchens should be redesigned for increased efficiencies 
a typical kitchen redesign costs approximately  it is the company s policy to own the land on which it builds new restaurants  however  it is sometimes necessary to enter ground leases to obtain desirable land on which to build 
five of the golden corral restaurants now in operation have been built on leased land 
three more golden corral ground leases have been entered into for restaurants to open respectively in june  october and november all of these leases have been accounted for as operating leases pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases as amended 
as of may  the company occupied restaurants pursuant to leases  ten of which are capital leases pursuant to sfas accounting for leases  as amended 
in september the company completed its plan to replace its headquarters legacy information system with an integrated enterprise system 
the capitalized cost for this project was approximately  including approximately  for the capitalized value of employees time and capitalized interest 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use estimates and assumptions to measure certain items that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
these judgments are based on knowledge and experience about past and current events  and assumptions about future events 
accounting estimates can and do change as new events occur and additional information becomes available 
actual results may differ markedly from current judgment 
two factors are required for an accounting policy to be deemed critical 
the policy must be significant to the fair presentation of a company s financial condition and its results of operations  and the policy must require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the company believes the following to be critical accounting policies 
self insurance the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
the company purchases coverage from an insurance company for individual claims in excess of  reserves for claims expense include a provision for incurred but not reported claims 
each quarter  the company reviews claims valued by its third party administrator tpa and then applies experience and judgment to determine the most probable future value of incurred claims 
as the tpa submits additional new information  the company reviews it in light of past history of claims for similar injuries  probability of settlement  and any other facts that might provide guidance in determining ultimate value of individual claims 
unexpected changes in any of these or other factors could result in actual costs differing materially from initial projections 
pension plans pension plan accounting requires rate assumptions for future compensation increases and the long term return on plan assets 
a discount rate is also applied to the calculations of net periodic pension cost and projected benefit obligations 
an informal committee consisting of executives from the finance department and the human resources department  with guidance provided by the company s actuarial consulting firm  develops these assumptions each year 
the consulting firm also provides services in calculating estimated future obligations and net periodic pension cost 
the plan assets are targeted to be invested percent in equity securities  as these investments have historically provided the greatest long term returns 
the company has used an percent expected long term rate of return on plan assets for many years  and will likely continue with that rate for the foreseeable future 
management believes that percent is a fair rate over the long term  despite poor market performance in the early years of the current decade which has adversely impacted net periodic pension cost in recent years  after many years of steady  low costs 

table of contents long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
property and equipment typically approximate percent of the company s total assets 
judgments and estimates are used to determine the carrying value of long lived assets 
this includes the assignment of appropriate useful lives  which affect depreciation and amortization expense 
capitalization policies are continually monitored to assure they remain appropriate 
in addition  carrying values of property and equipment are tested for impairment each quarter using historical cash flow losses on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
carrying values are also reviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
when undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than carrying values  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which carrying values exceed estimated realizable values 
future cash flows can be difficult to predict 
changing neighborhood demographics and economic conditions  and many other factors may impact operating performance  which affect cash flow 
estimated realizable values are provided by real estate brokers and or the company s past experience in disposing of property 
sometimes it becomes necessary to cease operating a certain restaurant due to poor performance 
the final impairment amount can be significantly different from the initial charge  particularly if the eventual market price received from the disposition of the property differs materially from initial estimates of realizable values 
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no significant market risk exposure to interest rate changes as substantially all of its debt is currently financed with fixed interest rates 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use foreign currency 
big boy restaurants utilize centralized purchasing and food preparation through the company s commissary and food manufacturing plant 
the company believes the commissary operation ensures uniform product quality and safety  timeliness of distribution to restaurants and ultimately results in lower food and supply costs 
the commissary operation does not supply golden corral restaurants 
food supplies are generally plentiful and may be obtained from any number of suppliers 
quality  timeliness of deliveries and price are the principal determinants of source 
commodity pricing affects the cost of many of the company s food products 
commodity pricing can be extremely volatile  affected by many factors outside the company s control  including import and export restrictions  supply versus demand  production and the impact of weather on crop yields 
certain commodities purchased by the commissary  principally beef  chicken  pork  dairy products  fish  french fries and coffee  are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
purchase contracts for some of these items may contain contractual provisions that limit the price to be paid 
the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity pricing 
except for items such as fresh produce and dairy products that are purchased from any number of local suppliers  the company currently purchases substantially all food  beverage and other menu items for use in its golden corral restaurants from the same approved vendor that golden corral franchising systems  inc franchisor uses for its operations 
deliveries are made two or three times per week 
other vendors are available to provide products that meet the franchisor s specifications at comparable prices should the company wish or need to make a change
