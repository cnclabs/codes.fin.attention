we believe that fostering long term customer relationships is critical to our success and allows us to better understand our customers needs and specifically tailor our transportation services to them 
one of our primary goals is to grow our gross margin 
we have achieved growth through an increase in revenue from our existing core transportation customers as well as from winning new customers 
our top customers revenue  which represents about of our core transportation revenue  has increased by approximately when comparing the year ended december  to december  during we severed relationships with certain low profitability customers which impeded our intermodal revenue growth 
revenue growth resulted primarily from price increases  fuel surcharges and mix when comparing to we use various performance indicators to manage our business 
we closely monitor gains and losses for our top customers and evaluate on time performance  costs per load by location and daily sales outstanding by location 
vendor cost changes and vendor service issues are also monitored closely 
we closed two operating centers during this has caused us to incur severance charges related to the downsizing of staff and charges to terminate building as well as equipment leases

as a result of prepaying the million of private placement debt  we will no longer incur the related interest which historically has been approximately million per year 
we will continue to have interest expense related to our deferred compensation plan 
contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations as of december  are minimum rental commitments 
minimum annual rental commitments  at december   under noncancellable operating leases  principally for real estate and equipment  are payable as follows in thousands and thereafter  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
in certain circumstances  those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and estimates 
allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable in the normal course of business  we extend credit to customers after a review of each customer s credit history 
an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts has been established through an analysis of the accounts receivable aging  an assessment of collectibility based on historical trends and an evaluation of the current economic conditions 
to be more specific  we reserve every account balance that has aged over one year  certain customers in bankruptcy and account balances specifically identified as uncollectible 
in addition  we provide a reserve for accounts not specifically identified as uncollectible based upon historical trends 
the allowance is reported on the balance sheet in net accounts receivable 
actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from management s estimates due to changes in future economic  industry or customer financial conditions 
recoveries of receivables previously charged off are recorded when received 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in accordance with eitf  revenue and related transportation costs are recognized based on relative transit time 
further  we report revenue on a gross basis in accordance with the criteria in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we are the primary obligor and are responsible for providing the service desired by the customer 
the customer views us as responsible for fulfillment including the acceptability of the service 
service requirements may include  for example  on time delivery  handling freight loss and damage claims  setting up appointments for pick up and delivery and tracing shipments in transit 
we have discretion in setting sales prices and as a result  our earnings vary 
in addition  we have the discretion to select our vendors from multiple suppliers for the services ordered by our customers 
finally  we have credit risk for our receivables 
these three factors  discretion in setting prices  discretion in selecting vendors and credit risk  further support reporting revenue on the gross basis 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of  related to state tax net operating losses for which valuation allowances have been established 
in the event the probability of realizing the remaining deferred tax assets do not meet the more likely than not threshold in the future  a valuation allowance would be established for the deferred tax assets deemed unrecoverable 
valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we utilize a third party independent valuation firm to assist in performing the necessary valuations to be used in the impairment testing 
these valuations are based on market capitalization  discounted cash flow analysis or a combination of both methodologies 
the assumptions used in the valuations include expectations regarding future operating performance  discount rates  control premiums and other factors which are subjective in nature 
actual cash flows from operations could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance and economic conditions 
should estimates differ materially from actual results  we may be required to record impairment charges in the future 
new pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we expect to adopt statement r effective july  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we expect the impact of the adoption of statement r to be between 
and 
per share 
had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the pro forma disclosures in the summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under the current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flow and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million and million in and  respectively 
outlook  risks and uncertainties business combinations divestitures we believe that future acquisitions or dispositions that we make could significantly impact financial results 
financial results most likely to be impacted include  but are not limited to  revenue  gross margin  salaries and benefits  selling general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  net income and our debt level 
on november   we  along with our wholly owned subsidiary  hub group distribution services  llc hgds  entered into the purchase option and right of first refusal agreement pursuant to which hgds granted an entity controlled by william j 
mckenna the exclusive option to purchase all or substantially all of the assets of hgds for a cash purchase price of  subject to adjustment on the closing date  plus the assumption of certain hgds liabilities 
mr 
mckenna agreed to serve as president of hgds effective december  mckenna s company may exercise the option during the period the option period commencing on november   and ending on the earlier to occur of i march   and ii the date on which mckenna s employment with hgds terminates  provided  however  that this period may be extended for up to days depending on the circumstances of the termination of mckenna s employment 
additionally  hgds granted mckenna s company a right of first refusal with respect to any acceptable third party offers that we or hgds receive during the option period for all or substantially all of the assets of hgds 
during the option period  we and hgds agreed that  except as required by law  we would not solicit or initiate discussions or negotiations with any person other than mckenna s company relating to the sale of hgds or its assets 
financial results may be impacted by additional factors as discussed below 
revenue we believe that the performance of the railroads and a severe or prolonged slow down of the economy are the most significant factors that could negatively influence our revenue growth rate 
should there be further consolidation in the rail industry causing a service disruption  we believe our intermodal business would likely be negatively impacted 
should there be another significant service disruption  we expect that there may be some customers who would switch from using our intermodal service to other transportation services 
we expect that these customers may choose to continue to utilize other services even when intermodal service levels are restored 
other factors that could negatively influence our growth rate include  but are not limited to  the elimination of fuel surcharges  the entry of new web based competitors  inadequate drayage service and inadequate equipment supply 
we expect that logistics revenue will continue to increase  however  we estimate the growth rate may not continue at the same level that was experienced in our installation services business  hgds  is a project based business with significant customer concentration and higher margins than our other service lines 
any decrease in the demand from these customers or our failure to secure new project business could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 
gross margin we expect fluctuations in the gross margin as a percentage of revenue from quarter to quarter caused by various factors including  but not limited to  changes in business mix  intermodal margins  truck brokerage margins  logistics margins  trailer and container capacity  vendor pricing  fuel costs  intermodal industry growth  intermodal industry service levels  competition and accounting estimates 
unlike other service offerings  our distribution services are comprised of certain higher margin projects 
there can be no assurance these higher margin projects will continue in the future 
salaries and benefits we estimate that salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as there are timing differences between revenue increases and changes in levels of staffing 
factors that could affect the percentage from staying in the recent historical range include  but are not limited to  revenue growth rates significantly higher or lower than forecasted  a management decision to invest in additional personnel to stimulate new or existing businesses  changes in customer requirements and changes in railroad intermodal service levels which could result in a lower or higher cost of labor per move 
selling  general and administrative we believe there are several factors that could cause selling  general and administrative expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue 
as customer expectations and the competitive environment require the development of web based business interfaces and the restructuring of our information systems and related platforms  we believe there could be significant expenses incurred  some of which would not be capitalized 
other factors that could cause selling  general and administrative expense to fluctuate include  but are not limited to  changes in insurance premiums and outside services expense including legal fees 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment we estimate that depreciation and amortization of property and equipment will decrease in as certain equipment and software is now fully depreciated 
impairment of property and equipment on an ongoing basis  we assess the realizability of our assets 
if  at any point during the year  management determines that an impairment exists  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced by the estimated impairment with a corresponding charge to earnings 
if it is determined that an impairment exists  management estimates that the write down of specific assets could have a material adverse impact on earnings 
other income expense we expect interest expense to decrease as compared to since we prepaid our private placement debt in the third quarter of factors that could cause interest expense to fluctuate include  but are not limited to  changes in lending rates  working capital needs  software development expenses and capital expenditures 
we estimate that interest income will likely increase compared to since we now have cash 
factors that could cause a change include  but are not limited to funding working capital needs and funding capital expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our bank line of credit which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize the risk from interest rate volatility through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
no derivative financial instruments are outstanding at december  we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce our total funding cost and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile
