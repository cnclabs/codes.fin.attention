item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview eastgroup s goal is to maximize shareholder value by being a leading provider of functional  flexible  and high quality business distribution space for location sensitive tenants primarily in the  to  square foot range 
the company develops  acquires and operates distribution facilities  the majority of which are clustered around major transportation features in supply constrained submarkets in major sunbelt regions 
the company s core markets are in the states of florida  texas  california and arizona 
the company primarily generates revenue by leasing space at its real estate properties 
as such  eastgroup s greatest challenge is leasing space at competitive market rates 
the company s primary risks are lease expirations  rental decreases and tenant defaults 
during  leases on of eastgroup s portfolio square footage expired  and the company was successful in renewing or re leasing of that total 
in addition  eastgroup leased  square feet of other vacant space during the year 
average rental rates on new and renewal leases for compared to were essentially unchanged 
bad debt expense for was  a decrease of  from eastgroup s total leased percentage increased to at december  from at december  the expiring leases anticipated for were of the portfolio at december  since the end of  the company has experienced positive leasing activity and reduced this percentage to as of march  property net operating income from same properties increased for as compared to the fourth quarter of was eastgroup s sixth consecutive quarter of positive same property comparisons 
the company generates new sources of leasing revenue through its acquisition and development programs 
during  the company purchased three parcels of land for development acres and four properties  square feet for approximately million 
eastgroup also acquired a undivided tenant in common interest in another property for million 
the company sold three properties and one parcel of land during for a combined total of approximately million 
these dispositions represented opportunities to recycle capital into acquisitions and targeted development with greater upside potential 
for  the company has projected million in new acquisitions net of dispositions and has identified approximately million of development opportunities 
in january  eastgroup purchased a million industrial business park  sold a million property in february and expects to close on another million acquisition later in the first quarter 
eastgroup continues to see targeted development as a major contributor to the company s growth 
the company mitigates risks associated with development through a board approved maximum level of land held for development and adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity 
during  the company transferred seven properties with an aggregate investment of approximately million from development to the operating portfolio  these properties were collectively leased as of december  in january  two development properties were transferred into the portfolio  both were leased 
also  in january  eastgroup purchased acres adjacent to its southridge development in orlando for million  which will increase the eventual build out of southridge by  square feet to a total of over one million square feet 
in february  the company acquired acres in tampa for million 
this represents all the remaining undeveloped industrial land in the oak creek park in which eastgroup currently owns two buildings 
the company primarily funds its initial acquisition and development programs through a million line of credit as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below 
as market conditions permit  eastgroup issues equity  including preferred equity  and or employs fixed rate  nonrecourse first mortgage debt to replace the short term bank borrowings 
in late september  the company closed a million  nonrecourse first mortgage loan secured by six properties 
the note has a fixed interest rate of  a ten year term  and an amortization schedule of years 
the proceeds of the note were used to reduce floating rate bank borrowings 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
in mid  the company plans to obtain million of additional fixed rate debt  using the proceeds to reduce variable rate bank line balances 
the company and the co owner of the undivided tenant in common investment in industry distribution center ii plan to secure permanent fixed rate financing on the investment 
proceeds from the financing will be used to reduce the company s bank debt and the million mortgage loan that the company made to the co owner of this property 
there can be no assurances that the fixed rate financing will be obtained 
eastgroup has one reportable segment industrial properties 
these properties are primarily located in major sunbelt regions of the united states  have similar economic characteristics and also meet the other criteria that permit the properties to be aggregated into one reportable segment 
the company s chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions property net operating income pnoi  defined as income from real estate operations less property operating expenses before interest expense and depreciation and amortization  and funds from operations ffo  defined as net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company calculates ffo based on the national association of real estate investment trust s nareit s definition 
pnoi is a supplemental industry reporting measurement used to evaluate the performance of the company s real estate investments 
the company believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry s calculation of pnoi provides a supplemental indicator of the property s performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
pnoi as calculated by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other reits 
the major factors that influence pnoi are occupancy levels  acquisitions and sales  development properties that achieve stabilized operations  rental rate increases or decreases  and the recoverability of operating expenses 
the company s success depends largely upon its ability to lease warehouse space and to recover from tenants the operating costs associated with those leases 
real estate income is comprised of rental income  pass through income and other real estate income including lease termination fees 
property operating expenses are comprised of property taxes  insurance  repair and maintenance expenses  management fees and other operating costs 
generally  the company s most significant operating expenses are property taxes and insurance 
tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable  modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable  or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable gross leases represent only a small portion of the company s total leases 
increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases 
modified gross leases often include base year amounts and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable 
the company s exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recoverable 
the company believes ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity real estate investment trusts 
the company believes that excluding depreciation and amortization in the calculation of ffo is appropriate since real estate values have historically increased or decreased based on market conditions 
ffo is not considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance  or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to provide for the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the company s key drivers affecting ffo are changes in pnoi as discussed above  interest rates  the amount of leverage the company employs and general and administrative expense 
the following table presents on a comparative basis for the three fiscal years reconciliations of pnoi and ffo available to common stockholders to net income 
in thousands income from real estate operations    operating expenses from real estate operations    property net operating income    equity in earnings of unconsolidated investment before depreciation income from discontinued operations before depreciation and amortization gain on involuntary conversion gain on securities  other income interest expense    general and administrative expense    minority interest in earnings before depreciation and amortization gain on sale of nondepreciable real estate dividends on series a preferred shares   dividends on series d preferred shares   costs on redemption of series a preferred  funds from operations available to common stockholders    depreciation and amortization from continuing operations    depreciation from unconsolidated investment depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations share of joint venture depreciation and amortization gain on sale of depreciable real estate investments  dividends on series b convertible preferred shares   net income available to common stockholders    dividends on preferred shares    costs on redemption of series a preferred  net income    net income available to common stockholders per diluted share 


funds from operations available to common stockholders per diluted share 
diluted shares for earnings per share    convertible preferred stock   diluted shares for funds from operations    the company analyzes the following performance trends in evaluating the progress of the company o the ffo change per share represents the increase or decrease in ffo per share from the same quarter in the current year compared to the prior year 
ffo per share increased for the th quarter of and for the year 
the company also experienced an increase in ffo per share for the third quarter of the second quarter of was the same as the prior year s second quarter 
these results are a key improvement over the previous eight quarters ending march  in which the change was negative ffo per share decreased 
the company anticipates an increase in ffo for compared to  primarily due to same property operations and operations resulting from acquisitions and developments 
o same property net operating income change represents the pnoi increase or decrease for operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period 
pnoi from same properties increased for the fourth quarter and for the year 
the fourth quarter of was the sixth consecutive quarter of positive results 
the company is continuing to see improvement which results from increases in occupancy more than offsetting the decrease in rental rates on lease renewals and new leasing 
the company budgeted an increase in pnoi for o occupancy is the percentage of total leasable square footage for which the lease term has commenced as of the close of the reporting period 
occupancy at december  was and included several seasonal tenant leases 
for the prior ten quarters ended september   occupancy ranged from to 
average occupancy is expected to continue to be in this range during o rental rate change represents the rental rate increase or decrease on new leases compared to expiring leases on the same space 
rental rate increases on new and renewal leases averaged for the fourth quarter of  year to year results were essentially unchanged 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the company 
real estate properties in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  the company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
the allocation to tangible assets land  building and improvements is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models 
factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
the remaining purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term  and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in other assets and other liabilities  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
during the industrial development stage  costs associated with development ie  land  construction costs  interest expense during construction and lease up  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs associated with development are aggregated into the total capitalization of the property 
included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs primarily personnel costs that are deemed directly or indirectly related to such development activities 
the company reviews its real estate investments for impairment of value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if any real estate investment is considered permanently impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
real estate assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
the evaluation of real estate investments involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
currently  the company s management is not aware of any impairment issues nor has it experienced any significant impairment issues in recent years 
in the event of impairment  the property s basis would be reduced and the impairment would be recognized as a current period charge in the income statement 
valuation of receivables the company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  the company performs credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates outstanding receivables and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management specifically analyzes aged receivables  customer credit worthiness  historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate for its outstanding receivables for the periods presented 
in the event that the allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient for an account that is subsequently written off  additional bad debt expense would be recognized as a current period charge in the income statement 
tax status eastgroup  a maryland corporation  has qualified as a real estate investment trust under sections of the internal revenue code and intends to continue to qualify as such 
to maintain its status as a reit  the company is required to distribute at least of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders 
the company has the option of i reinvesting the sales price of properties sold through tax deferred exchanges  allowing for a deferral of capital gains on the sale  ii paying out capital gains to the stockholders with no tax to the company  or iii treating the capital gains as having been distributed to the stockholders  paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to the stockholders 
the company distributed all of its  and taxable income to its stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes was necessary

 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
in december  the fasb published a revision to interpretation r to clarify some of the provisions of the original interpretation and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
under the new guidance  special effective date provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied interpretation prior to issuance of this revised interpretation 
otherwise  application of interpretation r was required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application by public entities  other than small business issuers  for all other types of variable interest entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  the adoption of this interpretation had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
this new standard is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve financial reporting by eliminating differences between gaap in the united states and gaap developed by the international accounting standards board iasb 
as part of this effort  the fasb and the iasb identified opportunities to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards 
statement amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  which was issued in the amendments made by statement are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the provisions in statement are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  early application is permitted and companies must apply the standard prospectively 
the company believes the adoption of this statement in will have little or no impact on its overall financial position or results of operation 
the fasb has issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment 
the new fasb rule requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
statement r represents the culmination of a two year effort to respond to requests from investors and many others that the fasb improve the accounting for share based payment arrangements with employees 
public entities other than those filing as small business issuers will be required to apply statement r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no

inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to five year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and long term debt maturities 
this debt is used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s objective for interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company borrows at fixed rates but also has several variable rate bank lines as discussed under liquidity and capital resources

eastgroup has an interest rate swap agreement that fixes the rate at for the year term 
interest and related fees result in an annual effective interest rate of the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for similar issues or by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to the company for debt of the same remaining maturities  as advised by the company s bankers 
as the table above incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
the ultimate impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates 
if the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate bank debt as shown above changes by or approximately basis points  interest expense and cash flows would increase or decrease by approximately  annually 
the company has an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to the variable interest rate on the company s  tower automotive center recourse mortgage  which is summarized in the table below 
under the swap agreement  the company effectively pays a fixed rate of interest over the term of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount 
this swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and is considered to be fully effective in hedging the variable rate risk associated with the tower mortgage loan 
changes in the fair value of the swap are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss
