item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item we adopted fin during the fourth quarter of as a result  the results of six flags over georgia  six flags over texas  six flags marine world and six flags white water atlanta  which were previously accounted for by the equity method  are now consolidated 
our consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis reflect our retroactive reclassification of our prior year results upon the adoption of fin to enable meaningful year to year comparisons and also reflects the effects of our reclassification of the assets  liabilities and results of our park located outside cleveland  ohio and our european parks which were sold in april as discontinued operations 
general our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of tickets for entrance to our parks approximately of revenues in and the sale of food  merchandise  games and attractions inside our parks 
our results were negatively affected by adverse weather in several of our major parks and the continuing effects of a sluggish economy  which affected both group sales attendance and individual visitations 
attendance for declined by compared to the prior year 
our attendance decline in was partially offset by a increase in per capita revenue 
our principal costs of operations include salaries and wages  employee benefits  advertising  outside services  maintenance  utilities and insurance 
our expenses are relatively fixed 
costs for full time employees  maintenance  utilities  advertising and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance 
in addition  we increased operating expenses in in order to provide enhanced guest service  which exacerbated the impact of the revenue decline on our cash flow 
despite our disappointing performance in  we were able to reduce the aggregate level of our indebtedness during the year using part of the net cash proceeds from the sale of our cleveland park and our european parks 
we were also able to effect an amendment to our credit agreement and refinance two series of long term debt 
the amendment relaxed covenants relating to the leverage ratio through and the fixed charge coverage ratio through  providing us additional financial flexibility in light of recent operating conditions 
by virtue of the refinancings  the nearest maturity of our public debt is february we plan to make approximately million of capital expenditures for the season adding a wide array of attractions at many of our parks 
these additions include a major expansion to our new jersey facility  which will include the introduction of a major new roller coaster  and the addition of a water park to our chicago park 
we plan to showcase the new rides and attractions in the second year of the new marketing and advertising campaigns we launched in we also plan to continue in the guest service enhancements we introduced in results of operations summary data for the years ended december were as follows in thousands  except per capital revenue summary of operations percentage changes v

revenue in totaled  million compared to  million for the decrease in resulted from a decrease in attendance offset in part by a increase in per capita revenue 
we believe that the attendance decline is largely attributable to adverse weather in several of our major markets and the continuing effects of a challenging economic environment for our target audience 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for increased million compared to expenses for the increase primarily reflects planned increases in salary and wage and fringe benefit expense approximately million and repair and maintenance expenditures approximately million as part of the implementation of our plan to enhance guest services generally 
selling  general and administrative  noncash compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased million compared to comparable expenses for the decrease primarily relates to a reduction in certain insurance expenses approximately million  arising out of lower premiums and improved loss experiences  and a reduction in legal and other services approximately million  offset by a planned increase in advertising expense million 
the million increase in in non cash compensation reflects the grant in january of a total of  shares of restricted stock to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer pursuant to new employment agreements 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold in increased million compared to costs for  reflecting our increased costs for food  merchandise and games inventories  as well as higher freight costs 
as a percentage of theme park food  merchandise and other revenue  costs of products sold increased to in compared to in the prior year 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased million compared to the increase compared to the level was attributable to our on going capital program 
interest expense  net of interest income  early repurchase of debt 
interest expense  net decreased million compared to  reflecting primarily lower debt levels 
the expense in for early repurchase of debt reflects the redemption in january of our senior notes due from the proceeds of our notes  the repayment of a portion of our term loan  and the repayment of million principal amount of debt from a portion of the proceeds of the sale in april of the discontinued operations and the repurchase of million principal amount of the notes and notes prior to year end from a portion of the proceeds of the convertible note offering 
the expense in reflects the retirement of million of our senior discount notes in that year  principally from the proceeds of the issuance of our senior notes due see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
minority interest in earnings 
minority interest reflects third party share of the operations of the parks that are not wholly owned by us  six flags over georgia including white water atlanta  six flags over texas and six flags marine world 
cash distributions to our partners and joint venturer were million in and million in other expense 
the increase in other expense in primarily reflects both the million write off of the book value of our investment in the owner of the madrid park we managed prior to november and related intangible assets see note to notes to consolidated financial statements and the million write off of the remaining book value of certain assets replaced as part of our and capital programs or otherwise determined to no longer be useable in our business 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense was million for compared to a benefit of million for income tax expense in was adversely affected by the valuation allowance applied to our us net deferred tax assets during that period and income tax expense attributable to our canadian and mexican operations 
see critical accounting issues and note m to notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   we estimated that we had approximately  million of net operating losses nols carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
the nols are subject to review and potential disallowance by the internal revenue service upon audit of our federal income tax returns and those of our subsidiaries 
in addition  the use of nols is subject to limitations on the amount of taxable income that can be offset with the nols 
some of the nols also are subject to a limitation as to which of the subsidiaries income the nols are permitted to offset 
during  we determined that it was no longer likely that all of the nols will be utilized prior to their expiration 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue in totaled  million compared to  million for the performance reflects the inclusion of six flags new orleans which was acquired in august for the full year 
excluding the new orleans park from both years  revenue decreased by million in  with attendance down by and per capita revenues up by operating expenses 
operating expenses for increased million compared to expenses for excluding the expenses at the new orleans park from both years  operating expenses in increased million as compared to the prior year primarily reflecting increased wage expense and fringe benefit expense relating to pension and medical benefits and the impact of exchange rates 
selling  general and administrative  noncash compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million compared to comparable expenses for excluding the expenses at the new orleans park from both years  selling  general and administrative expenses in increased million as compared to the prior year largely as a result of increased expenditures in advertising  insurance and real estate taxes and the impact of exchange rates 
noncash compensation in primarily reflects the final amortization of shares of restricted stock previously granted 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold in decreased million compared to costs for  notwithstanding a small increase in theme park food  merchandise and other revenue in as a percentage of theme park food  merchandise and other revenue  costs of products sold were approximately and  respectively  in and depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased million compared to the increase compared to the level was attributable to additional expense associated with six flags new orleans as well as our on going capital program 
interest expense  net of interest income  early repurchase of debt 
interest expense  net decreased million compared to  reflecting lower cost of funds and the incurrence of additional interest expense in related to a new note issue  the proceeds of which were applied to retire other outstanding notes approximately days after issuance of the new notes 
expenses relating to early repurchase of debt which are now shown before giving effect to the related tax benefit and were formerly accounted for as an extraordinary loss and shown on a net basis were million less in than in the prior year 
the expenses in both years reflect the refinancing of public debt 
we refinance our public debt primarily to extend maturities 
minority interest in earnings 
minority interest reflects third party share of the operations of the parks that are not wholly owned by us  six flags over georgia including white water atlanta  six flags over texas and six flags marine world 
cash distributions to our partners and joint venturer were million in and million in income tax benefit 
income tax benefit was million for compared to a million benefit for the effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate is impacted by the level of income or loss in each jurisdiction and each jurisdiction s tax rate 
in  the tax rate was also negatively impacted by nondeductible compensation expense 
results of discontinued operations on april   we sold substantially all of the assets used in the operation of six flags world of adventure near cleveland  ohio other than the marine and land animals located at that park and certain assets related thereto for a cash purchase price of million 
in a separate transaction on the same date  we sold all of the stock of walibi sa  our wholly owned subsidiary that indirectly owned the seven parks we owned in europe 
the purchase price was approximately million  of which euro million million as of april  was received in the form of a nine and one half year note from the buyer and million represented the assumption of certain debt by the buyer  with the balance paid in cash 
net cash proceeds from these transactions were used to pay down debt and to make investments in our remaining parks 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to reflect the operations  assets and liabilities of the parks sold as discontinued operations 
following are components of the net results of discontinued operations for the years ended december   and years ended december  operating revenue loss on sale of discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit net results of discontinued operations liquidity  capital commitments and resources general our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  funds from borrowings and existing cash on hand 
our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations  debt service  investments in parks including capital projects and acquisitions  preferred stock dividends and payments to our partners in the partnership parks 
we did not pay a dividend on our common stock during  nor do we expect to pay one in we believe that  based on historical and anticipated operating results  cash flows from operations  available cash and available amounts under our credit agreement will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs  including anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  scheduled debt and preferred stock requirements and obligations under arrangements relating to the partnership parks  for at least the next several years 
our current and future liquidity is  however  greatly dependent upon our operating results  which are driven largely by overall economic conditions as well as the price and perceived quality of the entertainment experience at our parks 
our liquidity could also be adversely affected by unfavorable weather  accidents or the occurrence of an event or condition  including terrorist acts or threats  negative publicity or significant local competitive events  that significantly reduces paid attendance and  therefore  revenue at any of our theme parks 
see business risk factors 
in that case  we might need to seek additional financing 
in addition  we expect to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt on or prior to maturity and to seek additional financing 
the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain any new financing or to effect any such refinancing 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements with respect to the forward looking statements continued in this paragraph 
in november  we consummated the public offering of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes 
except during specified non convertibility periods  the convertible notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock for each  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment  representing an initial conversion price of per share 
upon conversion of the notes  we have the option to deliver common stock  cash or a combination of cash and common stock 
prior to december   the net proceeds from the convertible notes offering were used to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes and million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes 
in addition  on december   we issued an irrevocable notice of partial optional redemption to holders of the notes with respect to the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of the notes on february  to be funded with the remaining net proceeds from the convertible notes offering 
the net proceeds to the company from the senior note offering were used to redeem the remaining million aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes on february   at the applicable redemption premium of  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
after giving effect to the refinancings  our total indebtedness  as of december   would have been approximately  million 
in addition  as of december  an additional million was available for borrowing under the credit agreement 
based on interest rates at december  for floating rate debt and after giving effect to the interest rate swaps described below and assuming the refinancings had been completed by that date  annual cash interest payments for on the debt outstanding at december  would have aggregated approximately million 
none of our public debt matures prior to february and none of the facilities under our credit agreement matures before june  in addition  the annual dividend requirements on our outstanding preferred stock total approximately million  which we can  at our option  pay either in cash or shares of our common stock 
we are required to redeem all of our outstanding preferred stock on august  to the extent not previously converted into shares of our common stock for cash at of the liquidation preference million  plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
we plan on spending approximately million on capital expenditures for the season 
at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash held exclusively to retire debt which had been called for prepayment and million available under our credit agreement  including the entire million working capital revolver 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  we are largely dependent upon the million working capital revolving credit portion of our credit agreement in order to fund off season expenses 
our ability to borrow under the working capital revolver is dependent upon compliance with certain conditions  including financial ratios and the absence of any material adverse change 
although we are currently in compliance with all of these conditions  on november   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement which relaxed the leverage ratio through and the fixed charge coverage ratio through if we were to become unable to borrow under the facility  we would likely be unable to pay our off season obligations in full and may be unable to meet our repurchase obligations if any in respect of repurchases of partnership units in the partnership parks 
the working capital facility expires in june the terms and availability of our credit agreement and other indebtedness would not be affected by a change in the ratings issued by rating agencies in respect of our indebtedness 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
since our business is both seasonal and involves significant levels of cash transactions  factors impacting our net operating cash flows are the same as those impacting our cash based revenues and expenses discussed above 
net cash provided by investing activities in was million  consisting primarily of net proceeds from the sale of the discontinued operations and maturities of restricted use investments representing the net proceeds from our december offering of the initial notes  which had been held in escrow to fund a portion of the redemptions in january of our senior notes due  offset in part by capital expenditures and the purchase of restricted use investments representing the net proceeds of the convertible note offering in november which had been held in escrow to fund a portion of the february redemption of our notes 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  representing the payment of  million in respect of retirement of certain debt including million of various series of our outstanding public notes and million of the term loan portion of our credit agreement  payment of preferred stock dividends and payment of debt issuance costs  offset in part by million in borrowings under our credit agreement including the million expansion of our term loan and the issuance of the convertible notes 
long term debt and preferred stock our debt at december  after giving effect to the refinancings included  million of fixed rate senior notes  with staggered maturities ranging from to  million under the term loan portion of our credit agreement and million of other indebtedness  including million of indebtedness at six flags over texas and six flags over georgia 
except in certain circumstances  the public debt instruments do not require principal payments prior to maturity 
our credit agreement includes a million term loan million of which was outstanding at december   a million multicurrency reducing revolver facility none of which was outstanding at december   excluding outstanding letters of credit and a million working capital revolver none of which was outstanding at that date 
the working capital facility must be repaid in full for consecutive days during each year and terminates on june  the multicurrency reducing revolving facility  which permits optional prepayments and reborrowings  requires quarterly mandatory reductions in the initial commitment together with repayments  to the extent that the outstanding borrowings thereunder would exceed the reduced commitment of of the committed amount thereof commencing on december   commencing on march   commencing on march  and commencing on march  and this facility terminates on june  the term loan facility requires quarterly repayments of of the outstanding amount thereof commencing on september  and commencing on september  the term loan matures on june  under the credit agreement  the maturity of the term loan will be shortened to december  if prior to such date our outstanding preferred stock is not redeemed or converted into common stock 
all of our outstanding preferred stock million liquidation preference must be redeemed on august  to the extent not previously converted into common stock 
see notes and to our notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our indebtedness and preferred stock 
from march  through december   we have prepaid million of the term loan and prepaid or retired an additional million of other debt from proceeds of the sales of the discontinued operations not including million of debt assumed by the purchaser of the european parks and repurchased million of public debt from a portion of the proceeds of the convertible note offering 
partnership park obligations as more fully described in business partnership park arrangements in connection with our acquisition of the former six flags  we guaranteed certain obligations relating to six flags over georgia and six flags over texas 
these obligations continue until  in the case of the georgia park  and  in the case of the texas park 
among such obligations are i minimum annual distributions including rent of approximately million in subject to cost of living adjustments in subsequent years to partners in these two partnerships parks of which we will be entitled to receive in approximately million based on our present ownership of of the georgia partnership and of the texas partnership  ii minimum capital expenditures at each park during rolling five year periods based generally on of park revenues  and iii an annual offer to purchase a maximum number of per year accumulating to the extent not purchased in any given year of limited partnership units at specified prices 
we plan to make approximately million of capital expenditures at these parks for the season  an amount in excess of the minimum cumulative required expenditure 
we were not required to purchase any units in the offer to purchase 
because we have not been required since to purchase a material amount of units  our maximum unit purchase obligation for both parks in is an aggregate of approximately million  representing approximately of the outstanding units of the georgia park and of the outstanding units of the texas park 
the annual unit purchase obligation without taking into account accumulation from prior years aggregates approximately million for both parks based on current purchase prices 
as we purchase additional units  we are entitled to a proportionate increase in our share of the minimum annual distributions 
cash flows from operations at these partnership parks will be used to satisfy the annual distribution and capital expenditure requirements  before any funds are required from us 
the two partnerships generated approximately million of aggregate net cash provided by operating activities in at december   we had total loans outstanding of million to the partnerships that own these parks  primarily to fund the acquisition of six flags white water atlanta and to make capital improvements 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in december  we guaranteed the payment of a million construction term loan incurred by hwp development llc a joint venture in which we own a interest for the purpose of financing the construction and development of a hotel and indoor water park project to be located adjacent to our great escape park near lake george  new york 
the hotel is scheduled to open in early  accordingly  we have not yet received any revenues from the joint venture but had advanced the joint venture approximately  at december  we acquired our interest in the joint venture through a contribution of land and a restaurant  valued at million the loan was also guaranteed by one of our venture partners 
the guarantee will be released upon full payment and discharge of the loan  which matures on december  as security for the guarantee  we deposited million in a cash collateral account 
at december   approximately million was outstanding under the construction term loan 
in the event we are required to fund amounts under the guarantee  our joint venture partners either must reimburse us for their respective pro rata share based on their percentage interests in the venture or their interests in the joint venture will be diluted or  in certain cases  forfeited 
we have entered into a management agreement to manage and operate the project upon its completion 
as of december   we were not involved in any other off balance sheet arrangements 
set forth below is certain information regarding our debt  preferred stock and lease obligations at december  in thousands payment due by period and beyond total contractual obligations long term debt piers real estate and operating leases purchase obligations total included under purchase obligations above are commitments for license fees to warner bros 
and commitments relating to capital expenditures 
license fees to warner bros 
for our domestic parks aggregate million annually through may effective june   the license fee is payable based upon the number of domestic parks utilizing the licensed characters 
based on current usage  the annual fee will increase to approximately million at that time 
in addition to the licensee fee  we also pay a royalty fee on merchandise sold using the licensed characters  generally equal to of the cost of the merchandise 
during the years ended december  and  we made contributions to our defined benefit pension plan of million and million  respectively 
we expect to make contributions of approximately million in in respect to our pension plans and and million in to k plan 
our estimated expense for employee health insurance for is million 
we do not expect our pension and k contributions to increase materially during the next several years 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
although we are contractually committed to make approximately million of capital expenditures at one park over the next several years  the vast majority of our capital expenditures in and beyond will be made on a discretionary basis 
we plan on spending approximately million on capital expenditures for the season

payments are shown at principal amount 
payments shown do not include interest payments or principal payments on our working capital revolver  no borrowings under which were outstanding at december  the million working capital revolver must be repaid in full for consecutive days in each year

through and new rides and attractions 
of the amount shown for  approximately million represents capital items 
the amounts in respect of new rides and attractions were computed at january  and include estimates by us of costs needed to complete such improvements that  in certain cases  were not legally committed at that date 
amounts shown do not include obligations to employees that can not be quantified at december  which are discussed below 
amounts shown also do not include purchase obligations existing at the individual park level for supplies and other miscellaneous items since such amount was not readily available 
none of the park level obligations is material 
during the three years ended december   insurance premiums and self insurance retention levels increased substantially 
however  as compared to the policies expiring in  the current policies  which expire in october  cover substantially the same risks neither property insurance policy covered terrorist activities  do not require higher aggregate premiums and do not have substantially larger self insurance retentions 
we cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage  the level of any self insurance retention applicable thereto  the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks  such as terrorism 
we may from time to time seek to retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on the prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases in which we determine that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as differing depreciation periods for our property and equipment and deferred revenue  for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets principally net operating loss carryforwards will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the variables that will impact whether our deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to their expiration include attendance  capital expenditures  interest rates  labor and insurance expenses  and changes in state or federal tax laws 
in determining the valuation allowance we do not consider  and under generally accepted accounting principles cannot consider  the possible changes in state or federal tax laws until the laws change 
we reduced our level of capital expenditures in and  although we will invest at higher levels in and  we expect to invest thereafter at lower levels than had been the case in prior years 
to the extent we reduce capital expenditures  our future accelerated tax deductions for our rides and equipment will be reduced  and our interest expense deductions would decrease as the debt balances are reduced by cash flow that previously would have been utilized for capital expenditures 
increases in capital expenditures without corresponding increases in net revenues would reduce short term taxable income and increase the likelihood of additional valuation allowances being required as net operating loss carryforwards expire prior to their utilization 
conversely  increases in revenues in excess of operating expenses would reduce the likelihood of additional valuation allowances being required as the short term taxable income would increase and we may be able to utilize net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
see note m to notes to consolidated financial statements 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill through december   we had assessed the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we considered important which could have triggered an impairment review included the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
through that date  when we determined that the carrying value of long lived assets and related goodwill may not have been recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measured any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
long lived assets were  million including goodwill and other intangible assets of  million as of december  long lived assets included property and equipment and intangible assets 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  as of january   we ceased amortizing approximately billion of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and are required to perform an annual impairment review thereafter  which we do as of the end of each year and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events 
to accomplish this  we identified our reporting units north america and europe and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  we then determined the fair value of each reporting unit  compared it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit and compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which were measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
based on the foregoing  we determined that million of goodwill associated with our european reporting unit was impaired and  during  we recognized a transitional impairment loss in that amount as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statements of operations 
for subsequent years we determined the fair value of our north american assets by using the discounted cash flow method  that is  we estimated annual cash flows applicable to our north american unit after deducting estimated capital expenditures  applied an estimated valuation multiple to a terminal cash flow amount  and discounted the result by an amount equal to our cost of capital 
based on the foregoing  no impairment was required for or our unamortized goodwill is  million at december  see note i to notes to consolidated financial statements 
as described above  we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets using a discounted cash flow analysis that combines current net results on a cash basis with the expected levels of future capital expenditures and then discounts the results  giving effect to the stock price multiple for the industry over a period of time 
if revenues decrease without a corresponding decrease in operating expenses and capital expenditures  this would increase the likelihood of goodwill impairment 
if valuations reflected in stock prices or theme park acquisitions decrease over time  this would also increase the likelihood of goodwill impairment 
if revenues increase faster than operating expenses and capital expenditures  this would decrease the likelihood of goodwill impairment 
market risks and sensitivity analyses like other global companies  we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the objective of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operations  cash flows and equity 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we are party to three interest rate swap agreements that for the term of the applicable agreements ranging from march to june effectively convert million of our million term loan into a fixed rate obligation 
our term loan borrowings bear interest at above the libor rate 
our interest rate swap agreements effectively lock in the libor component at rates ranging from to and average 
the counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions  which minimizes the credit risk 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis the following analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value  operations and cash flows of our market risk financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates as if these changes occurred at december  the range of changes chosen for this analysis reflect our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate assumptions 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of these changes in interest and exchange rates 
at december  and after giving effect to the refinancings  we would have had total debt of  million  of which  million represents fixed rate debt and the balance would have represented floating rate debt 
of the floating rate debt  million principal amount is subject to interest rate swap agreements which expire during the first six months of for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact book value  operations or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future operations and cash flows  assuming other factors remain constant 
additionally  increases and decreases in interest rates impact the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
a decrease in thirty and ninety day libor interest rates increases the fair value liability of the interest rate swap agreements 
however  over the term of the interest rate swap agreements  the economic effect of changes in interest rates is fixed as we will pay a fixed amount and are not subject to changes in interest rates 
assuming other variables remain constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements and assuming an average annual balance on our working capital revolver  the pre tax operations and cash flows impact resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be less than million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb published fasb statement no 
revised share based payment 
statement r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
as a larger public entity  we will be required to apply statement r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   which is the third quarter of statement r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
statement r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees
