major events impacting financial condition and results of operations on april   the company signed a fertilitypartners agreement with the margate  florida based northwest center for infertility and reproductive endocrinology ncire 
under the terms of the year agreement  the company s service fees are comprised of reimbursed costs of services  a tiered percentage of revenues  and an additional fixed percentage of ncire earnings

these warrants became exercisable july  and will expire on july  on november   the company announced the ending of its fertilitypartners agreement with rsa of new york 
the agreement ended on november  rsa of new york serves the long island market and revenues for the four quarterly periods ending prior to the announcement were million 
the program had a contribution of  for the same period 
at the time of the announcement  the company evaluated its exclusive business rights asset associated with rsa of new york and reduced that asset to its realizable value by adjusting the asset downward by  during  the company negotiated revised fee structures on three of its existing fertilitypartner contracts 
in all three of these contracts  the timetable for the phase in of that portion of the fee reductions which are based on the earnings of the underlying fertility centers was delayed by one year 
beginning in the year  two of these revised contracts  also contain a maximum limit on the amount of fees the company can earn  which are based on the earnings of the underlying fertility centers 
these maximum limitations are below the fees earned by the company on these portions of the contracts in the third contract contains no maximum limitation 
the company believes that these fee limitations will be more than offset by volume based increases in fees earned in other areas of its existing contracts  the sale of new fertilitypartner contracts and growth in its fertilitydirect business unit

the company expects this transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following accounting policies fit this definition basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of integramed america  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant inter company transactions have been eliminated 
the company principally derives its revenues from fertilitypartners contracts  the sale of pharmaceutical products and fees from patients enrolling in its shared risk refund program 
the company does not have a controlling financial interest in any of the medical practices to which it provides services and as such does not consolidate their results 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the most significant estimates include the allowance for uncollectibles related to pharmaceutical sales  the reserve for estimated refunds due to pregnancy loss in our shared risk refund program and the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue and cost recognition fertilitypartners service fees as of december   the company provided comprehensive services to fertility centers under seven fertilitypartners contracts 
under all seven agreements  the company receives as compensation for its services a three part fee comprised of i a tiered percentage of net revenues  ii reimbursed costs of services costs incurred in servicing a fertility center and any costs paid on behalf of the fertility center and iii a fixed percentage of earnings after services fees 
all revenues from fertilitypartners service fees are recorded in the period services are rendered

revenue and costs are recognized in the same period in which the related services have been performed 
pharmaceutical sales the company distributes fertility related pharmaceutical products through integramed pharmaceutical services  inc  ipsi 
the company has a servicing arrangement with ivpcare  inc  to fulfill the purchase and distribution of those pharmaceuticals 
ipsi accepts patient orders  verifies patient insurance coverage where applicable and ships prescription based pharmaceuticals directly to patients of certain affiliated fertility centers 
revenue is derived from the sales of these pharmaceuticals and is recorded  along with the related costs including the fee due ivpcare  when title and risk of loss pass to the customers  which is when shipments are made 
the cost of pharmaceutical products purchased is recorded as a cost of sales and is not offset against revenues

shared risk refund program the shared risk refund program consists of a fertility treatment package that includes up to three cycles of in vitro fertilization for one fixed price with a significant refund if the patient does not deliver a baby 
under this innovative financial program  the company receives payment directly from consumers who qualify for the program and pays contracted fertility centers a defined reimbursement for each treatment cycle performed 
expenses related to the program are recorded as incurred 
potentially refundable revenues are deferred until the pregnancy outcome is determined 
the company manages the risk associated with the shared risk refund program through a case management program 
this case management program authorizes patient care and provides information to be used in recognizing revenue 
a reserve for estimated refunds due to pregnancy loss is maintained and based on historical averages of pregnancy losses applied to the revenues recorded within the applicable periods 
due from medical practices due from medical practices represents the net amounts owed to the company by the medical practices 
this balance is comprised of amounts owed to the company by the medical practices for funds  which the company has advanced to the practices for use in financing their accounts receivable  less balances owed to the medical practices by the company for undistributed amounts earned by their physicians 
due from medical practices excludes amounts owed by the company to medical practices for acquired exclusive services rights since the financial accounting standards board interpretation conditions for offset are not met for these obligations
