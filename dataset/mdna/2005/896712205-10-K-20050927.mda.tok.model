overview trio tech international provides third party semiconductor testing and burn in services primarily through its laboratories in southeast asia 
the company operates in three distinct segments sales  manufacturing  and testing 
at or from its facilities in california and southeast asia  the company also designs  manufactures and markets equipment and systems used in the testing and production of semiconductors  and distributes semiconductor processing and testing equipment manufactured by others 
i results of operations and business outlook the following table sets forth our revenue components for the past three fiscal years revenue components year ended june  june  june  net sales manufacturing testing distribution total geographically  we operate in the us  singapore  malaysia  thailand and ireland 
our customers are mainly concentrated in southeast asia and they are either semiconductor chip manufacturers or testing facilities that purchase our testing equipment 
the testing segment remained our core segment and largest producer in the company  making up of the total net sales the last two fiscal years 
the manufacturing segment sales went from of total net sales in fiscal to in fiscal  with the majority of the hike in sales occurring in the first half of fiscal distribution sales  as a percentage of sales  declined as overall sales increased by compared to fiscal the company believes the current market trend indicates that most major end markets for semiconductors  such as electronic consumer products in asia  are on the uptrend 
according to semiconductor industry association  the communications revolution will drive the semiconductor industry to new heights 
there will be increased demand for microprocessor chips  which will be used in wireless handsets  automotive applications and wired communications  as indicated by increased unit sales of these products in the second quarter of 
table of contents because of the increase in manufacturing segment sales  the testing segment sales as a percentage of total net sales remained the same level from fiscal to fiscal  even though the testing segment experienced an increase in burn in services in southeast asia 
during fiscal  we acquired a burn in testing operation in malaysia  which began operating at the beginning of the fiscal year  in order to capture additional market share in the asian region 
the company allocated the purchase price of the newly acquired burn in division in malaysia to the tangible assets and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired was based on estimates and assumptions determined by the management 
other intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives 
the total purchase price was allocated as follows in thousands total purchase price cash notes payable allocated as follows fixed assets machinery and equipment leasehold improvements intangible assets customer relationship the excess purchase price over the fair value of tangible assets acquired was attributable to the customer relationship obtained from the aforementioned business acquisition and recorded as other intangible assets 
no goodwill is recognized in this context 
the customer relationship intangible will be amortized over its economic life based on the contract term as stated in the sales agreement with the customer on a straight line method over five years 
the value of customer relationship was originally presented as in our form k 
after further identification conducted after july   the company found that a value of approximately from equipment was included in this consequently  a reclassification was made to present the proper value of for the customer relationship  which was started to be amortized over five years from july  in fiscal  the company converted some of its plants in southeast asia to accommodate testing of the new  faster type of microprocessor chips to meet the increased demand for such products 
in addition  all the testing operations in southeast asia were recently certified with iso  qs and ts  which we believe will boost burn in services in southeast asia 
backlog in the malaysia and singapore testing operations increased by to  at the end of fiscal year from  at the end of fiscal due to the ramping up of testing services for faster speed microprocessor chips 
a tenant vacated our property at batang kali in malaysia during june without paying two months rental of the company plans to sell or lease the property  otherwise the company will lose approximately rental income per month if the property remain vacant 
the manufacturing segment sales as a percentage of total sales increased by from fiscal to fiscal the demand for the company s burn in systems increased concurrently with the demand for more microprocessor chips in asia  and the increase in burn in boards sales derived from a new customer 
this benefited the singapore manufacturing operation  especially in the first half of fiscal localization programs  in which governments strongly encourage customers to purchase from their same region  are being implemented in several different countries and as a result few customers are willing to continue to procure from their overseas vendors 
being an overseas vendor  we believe we may loose some sales to our customers local vendors  as customers have already begun to hold back their orders 
as a result  the backlog in the manufacturing operation in southeast asia dropped by  from  in fiscal to in fiscal the manufacturing operation in the us will continue to market used and refurbished equipment 
the distribution segment sales as a percentage of net total sales declined by from fiscal to fiscal sales in the us have yet to improve  therefore the company focused its marketing effort on asia 
the singapore distribution operations will be focusing on selling wet process stations mainly to research institutions and local universities  as well as working closely with their vendors to manufacture a plating system which will be used in the electronics  telecommunications  automotive and aerospace industries 
equipment and electronic component sales are very competitive  as the products are widespread in the market 
pressure from cost conscious consumers to lower prices translates throughout the supply chain  which means efficiency 
table of contents and productivity are of utmost importance 
the backlog in the distribution segment increased by to  as of june  as our singapore distribution operation closed some orders on vibration equipment and wet process stations during the end of the fiscal year 
key performance indicators for the company are based on market demand 
sales activities such as bookings and backlog  queries on products  customers forecasts and the financial results of customers and competitors formed part of our performance indicators 
according to data in the sems report  worldwide semiconductor equipment sales reached billion for the first six months of  or approximately below the first six months of europe  korea and north america continued to exhibit stronger performances over the first six months of  while japan  china and taiwan billings for wafer processing equipment declined by  and respectively  when compared to the same period last year 
semiconductor equipment sales in the north american market seem to be recovering 
the semi book to bill ratio dropped to in january but returned to in june  the same as there are several influencing factors which create uncertainties when forecasting performance  such as the ever changing nature of technology  including specific requirements from the customer  decline in demand for certain types of burn in devices or equipment  and other similar factors 
one of these factors is the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor industry 
another is that some customers are unable to provide a forecast of the products required in the upcoming weeks  hence it is difficult to plan out the resources needed to meet these customers requirements due to short lead time and last minute order confirmation 
this will normally result in a lower margin for these products  as it is more expensive to purchase materials in a short time frame 
however  the company has taken action to protect itself and has formulated plans for dealing with these unpredictable factors 
for example  in order to meet customers demands on short notice the company maintains higher inventories  but continues to work closely with its customers to avoid stock piling 
we continue to cut costs by remaining economic in scale and maintaining a lean headcount  while still keeping quality high so as to sell new products at a competitive price 
we have also been improving customer service from staff by keeping them up to date on the newest technology and stressing the importance of understanding and meeting the stringent requirements of our customers 
furthermore  we subcontract certain areas of manufacturing functions to ease supervisory and administrative work 
finally  the company is exploring new markets and products  looking for new customers  and upgrading and improving burn in technology while at the same time searching for alternatives to burn in 
ii financial information during the fiscal year ended june   total assets increased by from  at june  to  at june  the majority of the increase was in accounts receivables  other intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment  but offset with a decrease in short term deposits of  though the bulk of the movements in the aforementioned assets derived from the testing segment  the overall assets of this segment did not increase substantially 
the decrease in short term deposits was inversely related to the increase in the rest of the assets 
the total assets in the manufacturing segment decreased with the decline in accounts receivable as its sales surged from q of fiscal to q of fiscal on the other hand  the accounts receivables in the distribution segment increased due to higher sales in q of fiscal as compared to the same period last year  with no major decline in other assets 
hence  the rise in total assets was attributable mainly from the distribution segment 
the increase in accounts receivables from  at june  to  at june  was mainly attributable to the higher sales from the distribution and testing operations in southeast asia in q of fiscal as compared to q of fiscal sales for all operations during fiscal were  which increased by as compared to the sales during fiscal at the same time  the operations in southeast asia improved their efficiency in collection  especially after the malaysia testing operation synchronized its billing function with its customers  which resolved some of the long outstanding debts 
the collection period for the company was shortened from an average of days at june  to an average of days at june  the company recognized as of july  in other intangible assets for the customer relationship intangible  which will be amortized over five years 
the amortization expense of the customer relationship intangible was during fiscal consequently  the remaining balance of the customer relationship intangible amounted to at june  property  plant and equipment increased by  from  at june  to  at june  mainly due to the acquisition of fixed assets by the testing segment in southeast asia 
during fiscal  additions to property  plant and equipment totaled  of which was paid as a deposit before june   but the renovation was completed and equipment was received in the first quarter of fiscal of the additions were due to the acquisition of fixed assets located in the new burn in operation in malaysia and and were related to the purchases of new plant and machinery  and renovation of the new plant in malaysia to meet the customer s requirements  respectively 
in addition  we converted three of the existing facilities in the singapore testing operation at a cost of in order to handle the burn in process of the new type of microprocessor chips 
other fixed asset purchases included office equipment and machinery by the singapore and thailand operations 

table of contents the drop in short term deposits  which decreased by  from  at june  to  at june  was due to several reasons 
the total acquisition costs of the burn in operation in malaysia  which amounted to  were fully paid by december  through internal funding 
in addition  more plant and machinery and renovation  in the amount of and respectively  were purchased to meet the customer s requirement  was placed as a deposit for the rental of the factory and utilities with the landlord and utilities vendor in the malaysia operation 
the existing malaysia operation paid out dividends of to its minority interest  which was declared out of retained earnings for the year ended june  there was a payment of annual wages  salaries and performance incentives of during fiscal in the singapore and malaysia operations 
the company also made payments of for fiscal audit during fiscal in addition  the singapore and ireland operations and corporate paid taxes of  and  respectively  during fiscal  which were offset by a tax refund of in the singapore and malaysia operations after the tax assessments for prior years were finalized 
total liabilities at june  were  reflecting a increase from  at june  this was mainly due to the increase in line of credit  accrued expenses and income tax payable  offset with the decrease in accounts payable of one of our lines of credit increased by due to the financing obtained by the singapore operations in the normal course of business 
income tax payable also increased by  mainly attributable to the singapore operations for the increase in taxable income  to a profit of in fiscal from a loss of in fiscal accrued expenses increased by  mainly attributable to the singapore and malaysia operations 
in the singapore operation there was a higher provision for warranty of due to higher equipment sales and an increase in commissions of due to a greater number of commissionable sales  final outstanding balances for fixed assets purchase of  higher sales tax of and accrued purchases of at june  this was partially offset with lower accrued utilities of  as payments were made by june  after the company changed its fiscal report period to end on the last day of the fiscal year 
in the malaysia operation there was an increase in accrual of payroll for contract workers of  performance incentives of for employees who previously worked for the seller of the burn in operation  payroll related costs of  final outstanding balances for fixed assets purchases of and higher accrued utilities of for the newly acquired operation at june   while none was accrued in june  there was also unearned revenue of in one of the us operations  as the sale of a wet process station did not meet our revenue recognition policy 
in addition  the accrual for fiscal annual audit fees of was reversed as the services have not been provided 
accounts payable decreased by since june  due mainly to fewer materials purchased in the singapore manufacturing operation proportionally with its lower backlog 
this offset the higher purchase of raw materials by in the singapore distribution operation 
as of june   total liabilities excluding minority interest were of total capital  compared with at june  total liabilities as a percentage of total capital were lower in fiscal mainly due to lower accounts payable as mentioned earlier 
critical accounting estimates policies we prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of different assumptions or conditions 
in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policy  the company identified the most critical accounting principles upon which its financial status depends 
the company determined that those critical accounting principles are related to the use of estimates  inventory valuation  revenue recognition  income tax and impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets 
the company states these accounting policies in the relevant sections in this management s discussion and analysis  including the recently issued accounting pronouncements discussed below 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts during the normal course of business  we extend unsecured credit to our customers 
typically  credit terms require payment to be made between to days of the sale 
we do not require collateral from our customers 
we maintain our cash accounts at credit worthy financial institutions 

table of contents we regularly evaluate and monitor the creditworthiness of each customer on a case by case basis 
we include any account balances that are determined to be uncollectible  along with a general reserve  in the overall allowance for doubtful accounts 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
based on the information available to management  we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of june  inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand 
we make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
we write down inventories for not saleable  excess or obsolete raw materials  works in process and finished goods by charging such write downs to cost of sales 
in addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts  statistics and judgments are used for assessing provision of the remaining inventory based on salability and obsolescence 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of the company s products is recognized upon shipment or delivery  depending upon the terms of the sales order  provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  the sales amount is fixed and determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
we allocate a portion of the invoice value to products sold and the remaining portion of invoice value to installation work in proportion to the fair value of products sold and installation work to be performed 
the fair value determination of products sold and the installation and training work is also based on our specific historical experience of the relative fair values of the elements if there is no easily determinable market price to be considered 
a portion of the company s sales is contributed from testing services 
revenue derived from testing service is recognized when testing services are rendered 
the company reduces revenue based on estimates of future credits to be granted to customers 
credits are granted for reasons such as product returns due to quality issues  volume based incentives  and other special pricing arrangements 
income tax in determining income for financial statement purposes  the company must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in the ordinary course of global business there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our foreign subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the regions where they operate 
because of the different income tax jurisdictions  net losses generated in the us cannot be utilized to offset the taxable income generated in foreign countries 
therefore  we may incur certain income tax expenses in any fiscal year though the company may generate lower income before income taxes 
although the company believes the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
as part of its financial process  the company must assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets can be recovered 
if recovery is not likely  the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable 
in this process  certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  the taxable income that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks  and taxable income in future years 
the company s judgment regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made 
in addition to the risks described above  the effective tax rate is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when certain indicators are present that suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this review process primarily focuses on other intangible assets from business acquisitions and property  plant and equipment 
factors considered include the under performance of a business compared to expectations and shortened useful lives due to planned changes in the use of the assets 
recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of long lived assets to estimate future undiscounted cash flows 
if future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the 
table of contents long lived assets  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
additionally  in the case of assets that will continue to be used by the company in future periods  a shortened life may be utilized if appropriate  resulting in accelerated amortization or depreciation based upon the expected net realizable value of the asset at the date the asset will no longer be utilized by the company 
actual results may vary from estimates due to  among other things  differences in operating results  shorter asset useful lives and lower market values for excess assets 
results of operations year ended june  compared to june  the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net sales for fiscal years and  respectively net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses general and administrative selling research and development impairment loss loss gain on disposal of pp e total operating expenses income from operations overall net sales and gross margin overall net sales for fiscal were  up from net sales of  in fiscal the growth in net sales was primarily due to an increased demand for our manufacturing products and testing services 
the bulk of the net sales were generated from customers in asia due to the uptrend in the market for electronic consumer products in this region  whereas there was a slow recovery in capital spending in the us the sales mix in the distribution segment followed the same trend 
the overall gross margin declined slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal the erosion in the margin was the result of a surge in sales for low margin burn in boards  which caused the group margin to slide compared to last fiscal year 
in addition  inventory totaling was written off in the us manufacturing operation due to obsolescence 
the decline in overall gross margin from the manufacturing segment was partially offset by the increased margins in the testing and distribution segments  which were the result of many factors to be further explained later 
manufacturing segment the revenue and gross margin for the manufacturing segment for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited revenue gross margin net sales in the manufacturing segment increased by from fiscal to fiscal the increase was due in part to increased sales of burn in systems  which improved by with a increase in quantity sold and a drop in average unit selling price of  and increased sales of burn in boards by  a spike in quantity sold and a rise in average unit selling price 
some of our electronic device manufacturing customers increased their capital equipment in order to meet their increase in production capacity 
the personal computer market is expanding in asia leading to greater demand for electronic components 
the increase in sales of burn in boards derived from newly acquired customers in this region whom the company had been pursuing for some time 
however  these factors were offset by lower sales of artic temperature controlled chucks  environmental test equipment and wet process stations 
sales of artic temperature controlled chucks dropped by 
table of contents from fiscal to fiscal  with a decrease of in quantity sold and an increase of in average unit selling price 
environmental test equipment sales declined by from fiscal to fiscal  with a increase in quantity sold but a decrease in the average unit selling price 
sales for both of these items were affected by cautious spending in the us due to inventory adjustments on capital equipment in the distribution channel  which in turn affected the manufacturing of equipment in the us operation 
sales of wet process stations of  from fiscal primarily came from universal systems 
this manufacturing operation in san jose  california was moved to singapore in fiscal due to high manufacturing costs in the us the singapore distribution personnel were trained to manufacture 
wet process stations at that time 
during fiscal  a wet process station was delivered to the customer but the company was unable to recognize the sale as it did not meet our revenue recognition policy sab 
therefore  no wet process stations were sold in fiscal the gross margin in the manufacturing segment decreased by  even though sales increased by compared to fiscal the hike in sales of burn in boards was not enough to raise the overall gross margin  and the same was true for the hike in quantity sold of burn in systems though their price had lowered 
however  the company wishes to continue to manufacture low margin burn in boards in order to maintain market share 
sales by the manufacturing segment in the us dropped by from  in fiscal to in  but the cost of sales  which include fixed and semi fixed costs  did not decrease proportionately due to the fact that the operation was already operating at minimal cost 
additionally  the us operation had to write off in inventory due to obsolescence 
testing segment the revenue and gross margin for the testing segment for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited revenue gross margin the testing segment net sales increased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal the bulk of the sales increase was in our newly acquired burn in operation in malaysia  which accounted for approximately of total burn in services 
although the singapore testing operation experienced a change in services mix  the high demand for testing of the new type of microprocessor chips was more than enough to make up for the drop in sales volume for testing of the slower speed microprocessor chips 
customers changed their requirements  which resulted in a lower average unit selling price for many of our products 
however  we expect to be compensated for this by the increase in burn in services demanded for the new  faster microprocessor chips 
the semiconductor market in thailand declined noticeably  and our operation in that region experienced a drop off in sales by to in fiscal as compared to sales of in fiscal the gross margin in the testing segment increased by from fiscal to fiscal the improvement in the singapore testing operation increased the overall margin for this segment 
by upgrading the existing facilities in that region  the operation avoided incurring additional rental costs for the burn in services for the new chips and saved in terms of minimal renovation costs without incurring much depreciation 
however  further renovation will incur more costs 
with more efficient manpower scheduling  labor costs as a percentage of sales dropped from in fiscal to in fiscal  which also positively impacted the gross margin for this segment 
distribution segment the revenue and gross margin for the distribution segment for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited revenue gross margin the distribution segment experienced only insubstantial changes in net sales and gross margin 
however  the distribution segment had a significant change in sales mix 
higher margin test chambers  vibration equipment and other products increased in sales by in fiscal over fiscal  with a increase in quantity sold and a rise in average unit selling price 
this was mainly due to the semiconductor markets in taiwan and china  which grew strongly over the past year 
the majority of our new customers had facilities set up in china and needed test equipment for their quality control 
hence  there was a hike in demand for vibration equipment and test chambers from customers in asia 
in addition  a new distribution operation was set up in singapore in fiscal to act as a distributor of electronic components for customers in the region  which also positively impacted sales 
sales of lower margin front end products dipped by from fiscal to fiscal  with a drop of in quantity sold and a decline of in average unit selling price 
the reason for this decrease was the decline in customer demand for these products in the us thus  the sales team shifted focus from lower margin front end 
table of contents products to marketing other  more profitable products 
sales of parts and services dropped from fiscal to fiscal as the company shifted its focus to training and testing on the manufacturing of wet process stations 
the increase in gross margin for the distribution segment was due to the substantial percentage increase in quantity and average unit selling price for test chambers and vibration equipment 
the increase in margin for test chambers and vibration equipment was able to negate the negative impact from decreased sales volume and selling price of lower margin products and spare parts 
sales by geographical area geographically  net sales into and within the united states region decreased by slightly more than half when compared to fiscal this was mainly attributable to the manufacturing operation in the us in fiscal  we relocated universal systems from the us to singapore due to high manufacturing costs in the us during the transition period  the engineers in singapore were sent for training 
hence  this manufacturing operation was unable to contribute to sales to the extent that it did in fiscal and resulted in the decline of of the total decline in sales in the us lastly  the slide in sales of lower margin products in the singapore distribution operation also contributed to the decline in sales into the us the various singapore operations  along with the newly acquired malaysia testing operation  contributed to the increase in net sales into and within southeast asia by compared to fiscal faster recovery in the consumer and electronics market in the asian region  as compared with those of the us  boosted sales for the testing and distribution operations in this area 
net sales into and within ireland and other countries increased by compared to fiscal  due to higher equipment and peripherals sales by singapore distribution operation to japan  taiwan and india 
operating expenses the operating expenses for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited general and administrative selling research and development impairment loss loss gain on disposal of pp e as a percentage of sales  operating expenses decreased by from in fiscal to in fiscal this slight drop was attributable to the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in the manufacturing segment 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by from in fiscal to in fiscal this was primarily due to the sudden surge in sales of burn in boards and systems in the manufacturing segment  while at the same time  keeping operating expenses in this segment minimal 
on the other hand  in terms of dollar value  general and administrative expenses increased by compared to fiscal due to a number of factors 
salaries in the southeast asia region increased to accommodate the new testing operation in malaysia and the higher headcount needed in the singapore cost center to support operations in southeast asia 
bonus provisions in the amount of were incurred in due to better performance by the singapore testing and manufacturing operations personnel  whereas there was a reversal of bonuses in the amount of in due to unmet bonus criteria 
increased professional fees  such as an iso audit and outsourcing of accounting services  contributed to of the increase in the singapore and thailand operations 
depreciation costs from the thailand and malaysian operations increased by due to the add on of a building extension and facility renovations needed to accommodate new products 
furthermore  the company accrued in fiscal for an annual event  which was cancelled in fiscal we incurred higher bank charges of in the singapore operation for the renewal of a guarantee and an increase in insurance in the amount of for a new policy 
we incurred in the malaysia operation due to higher operating expenses such as printing and stationary  insurance  upkeep of office and non capitalized assets  as well as a higher provision for doubtful debts of  as the tenant in our malaysia facility defaulted on payment 
in the same operation was an overprovision for the cost of moving equipment in fiscal after the operation was scaled down 
we incurred an increase in amortization costs of for customer relation intangibles in the malaysia operation  and an increase of for legal matters pertaining to this newly acquired facility 
we also incurred fees of for consulting work on sox requirements and legal fees of for the newly acquired operation for sec disclosure purposes 
corporate officers traveled more in fiscal  increasing travel and entertainment costs by another in board fees were incurred due to an adjustment in directors compensation at the beginning of the fiscal year 
furthermore  there was a reversal of bonuses of in the us operation in fiscal due to unmet bonus criteria  whereas no such reversal occurred in in the ireland operation  we reinstated managers salaries in an 
table of contents aggregate amount of as said amount had been lowered in fiscal due to cost cutting measures 
finally  there was an increase in bad debts expense of in one of the us operations for irrecoverable debt and in miscellaneous costs 
however  all of these factors were somewhat offset by certain factors  such a savings from the universal systems operation after it was relocated from san jose to singapore 
for the same reason there were savings of in equipment rental  in insurance and in audit fees 
also  there was lower headcount in the accounting department in the us  which lowered the salary expenditure by finally  there was in lowered audit fees  as the service for fiscal have not yet been performed 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal due primarily to the surge in manufacturing sales which offset an increase in headcount in distribution and higher commission and advertisement costs in singapore 
however  in terms of dollar value  selling expenses increased by from fiscal to fiscal due to several factors 
salaries increased by due to increased headcount for the expansion of the distribution operation in singapore 
the provision of warranty increased by and commissions increased by due to higher equipment sales in the manufacturing and distribution segments  respectively 
additionally  there was commission income in the distribution segment in the amount of in fiscal and none in fiscal finally  more in advertising costs were spent in order to procure new customers in singapore 
all these factors were somewhat offset by savings in salaries of sales personnel of  commission of and rental and utilities of as compared to fiscal due to the relocation of the manufacturing operation from san jose to singapore 
additionally  some new customers of our malaysia and singapore operations were located in those same areas  therefore cutting traveling expenses by research and development expenses decreased from fiscal to fiscal due to less activity in the us operation 
the company had an impairment loss of in fiscal consisting of machinery and equipment  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvement pertaining to the singapore testing operation 
due to the decrease in demand for the slower speed microprocessor chips  some of our existing burn in facilities assets became obsolete 
in contrast to fiscal  there was an impairment loss in the amount of there was a gain on disposal of fixed assets of in fiscal  derived primarily from the ireland and thailand operations  on sales of equipment and boards 
there was a minimal loss in fiscal on disposal of fixed assets 
income loss from operations the income loss from operations for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited manufacturing segment testing segment distribution segment corporate the income from operations increased by from fiscal to fiscal  contributable to all but the distribution segment 
in the manufacturing segment  loss from operations went down from in fiscal to in fiscal the relocation of universal systems resulted in the reduction of certain fixed costs  such as in salaries  in office and equipment rental  in utilities and insurance costs  in commissions and another in professional and audit fees 
the transferred operation is currently being operated by existing singapore personnel 
general and administrative expenses in the manufacturing segment as a percentage of sales by that segment dropped from in fiscal to in fiscal while selling expenses as a percentage of sales dropped from to  mainly due to the increase in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal furthermore  the manufacturing operation in singapore managed the sales increase with its existing headcount while outsourcing some projects in order to maintain a lean workforce 
with this strategy  the operation was able to operate at lower overhead 
the testing segment experienced a increase in income from operations from fiscal to fiscal much of this improvement was due to higher gross profit 
some was the result of more efficient scheduling of manpower and the upgrading of some of our existing facilities to cater to the changing requirements of customers  which put us at a competitive edge and allowed us to generate greater profits 
despite higher general and administrative expenses in this segment  which increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  the gross profit was more than enough to offset the higher salaries  salary related expenses and additional costs for setting up the newly acquired burn in facility in malaysia 
in addition  the malaysia testing 
table of contents operation synchronized its billing function with its customers in order to resolve some long outstanding debts 
as a result  no doubtful debts provision was required from this operation at the end of fiscal these improvements in the overall income from operations were offset by the decline in operating income in the distribution segment  which dropped by from fiscal to fiscal this decline was mainly due to lower sales and greater selling expenses incurred in the singapore distribution operations 
additionally  we mobilized some of our engineers to undergo training on the manufacturing of wet process stations 
this training and testing required a fair amount of time and cost for these engineers  impacting the income from operation in this segment 
additionally  selling expenses as a percentage of sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to increased commissions of in the singapore distribution operation as a result of an increase in sales of commissionable equipment 
this same operation had commissionable income of in fiscal but none in fiscal salaries in this segment increased by due to the expansion of the distribution operation in singapore 
however  at the current level of sales as a distributor  the margin was not sufficient to cover the salary and rental costs 
we anticipate that the operation will continue to search for products with a higher margin 
there was no major movement in the operating income for corporate  which remained at as compared to fiscal interest expense the interest expenses for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited interest expense interest expense increased by from fiscal to fiscal this was due to higher usage of credit by the singapore operations for the expansion of its facilities  thereby incurring higher interest expenses of the higher expenses were offset by a decrease in the interest from capital leases of and a decrease in miscellaneous expenses of other income other income for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited other income other income decreased by from fiscal to fiscal due to several factors 
there was a gain on marketable securities of after the malaysia subsidiary disposed of all investments and subsequently exited the market in fiscal  whereas there was no such transaction in fiscal furthermore  there was lower interest income of and lower dividend income of from the malaysia subsidiary 
however  this was offset by the increase in rental income of due to the leasing out of the facilities in ireland and malaysia 
there was an exchange gain of in the singapore and thailand operations 
finally  sundry income increased by income tax the total income tax provision increased by  from in fiscal to in fiscal of the change of  there was an increase in the current portion of foreign income tax by  from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was attributed mainly to the higher taxable income generated by our singapore operation 
the singapore operation generated a profit of in fiscal and a loss of in fiscal in addition  there was a tax provision of in the thailand operation based on taxable income of in fiscal this was lower compared to the tax provision of in fiscal based on taxable income of even though the malaysia and ireland operations suffered losses in fiscal  there were still certain minimal tax provisions incurred 
the increase in deferred income tax provision of which was incurred in fiscal was the difference between deferred tax liability solely in singapore of as of june  and as of june  comparing the deferred income tax benefit of for fiscal  the resulting change was  accounting for of the total change of aforementioned 
the increase in deferred tax liabilities was attributable mainly to the result of the timing differences related to the recording of depreciation expenses for book and tax purposes and estimated tax liability resulting from accumulated corporate expense allocated from the us in the meantime  the company did not recognize any deferred income tax benefits related to the net operating losses generated in the us management believes that it was more likely than not that these future benefit from these timing differences would not be realized 
accordingly  the company provided a full valuation on the estimated deferred tax assets 

table of contents the company s effective income tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the higher effective income tax rate in fiscal was due mainly to the decrease in foreign tax rate reduction which was negative for fiscal compared to negative in fiscal the decrease in foreign tax rate reduction was the result of an increase in income tax provision in our subsidiaries outside the us for fiscal compared to the income tax provision in these subsidiaries for fiscal in addition  the change in valuation allowance to deferred tax assets in fiscal contributed compared to in fiscal finally  the other permanent differences contributed in fiscal whereas there were none in fiscal the company files income tax returns in the us  singapore  thailand  malaysia  and ireland  respectively 
income taxes are provided in those countries where taxable income is earned 
income in one country is not offset by losses in another country 
accordingly  no benefit is provided for losses in the countries except where the loss can be carried back against income recognized in previous years 
in essence  the effect of providing tax provision against taxable income and providing no benefit for losses generated in the us results in an effective tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate 
net income as a result of all of the factors analyzed above  the net income for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately  which represented an increase of from a net income of for fiscal basic earnings per share for fiscal remained the same at per share as in fiscal diluted earnings per share for fiscal remained at per share as in fiscal year ended june  compared to year ended june  the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net sales for fiscal and  respectively net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses general and administrative selling research and development impairment loss gain loss on disposal of pp e total operating expenses income from operations overall net sales and gross margin overall sales for fiscal were  down  from fiscal by a difference of 
this decrease in sales was primarily due to the significant drop in sales in the distribution segment  as well as decreased activity in the testing segment  both of which offset the surge in sales in the manufacturing segment  especially in the fourth quarter 
overall gross margin increased marginally by less than from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily attributable to the distribution segment even though sales in that segment decreased significantly 
distribution segment the revenue and gross margin for the distribution segment for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited revenue gross margin net sales in the distribution segment decreased  a decrease of  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the bulk of the sales decline was attributable to the decrease in unit volume of low margin products  which experienced a 
table of contents reduction in sales revenue of  from fiscal to fiscal  along with a drop in quantity sold and a reduction in selling price 
sales of vibration products and reflow ovens fell by  with a drop of in quantity sold 
the demand for vibration products diminished as this equipment had an average unit selling price greater than customers in the united states remained conservative in making large investments  hence demand was low 
customers showed a preference to purchase substitute equipment at an average selling price below as for reflow ovens  customers developed more stringent requirements in technology  and our existing vendor was unable to satisfy the change 
we will continue to search for other vendors who can meet our customers requirements 
however  the unit selling price of vibration products and reflow ovens increased by over fiscal due to our ability to meet customers specialized demands  hence their willingness to pay more for this benefit 
additionally  spare parts and services increased sales by despite the decline in sales in the distribution segment overall  the margin showed an improvement of  from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the decreased sales of low margin products combined with the improvement in average unit selling price of vibration products and reflow ovens 
this contributed mainly to the slight improvement in the overall gross margin compared to fiscal testing segment the revenue and gross margin for the testing segment for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited revenue gross margin the testing segment also experienced some deterioration in sales 
sales dropped by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal burn in volume for this segment decreased due to a change in customers burn in requirements 
we adjusted to meet these specifications  but still suffered a lower margin of from fiscal because of operating with fixed costs 
also contributing was the fall in product life cycle for one particular type of burn in  and one new type of burn in had yet to ramp up as expected 
additionally  we adopted a reduction in service fees of approximately in an effort to maintain existing customers and attract new ones in an increasingly competitive market 
gross margin dropped by  from in fiscal to in fiscal due to several factors 
first  the company reduced service fees in an effort to retain existing customers and capture new ones in an increasingly competitive market 
second  material costs  such as utilities  increased due to higher usage of certain products and some new administrative charges from the utilities vendor 
although the thailand operation saw boosted sales in fiscal  it generated a lower margin due to a change in product mix  as more services at a lower margin were provided to one particular customer with whom trio tech has a long standing relationship 
manufacturing segment the revenue and gross margin for the manufacturing segment for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited revenue gross margin the setback in sales in the testing and distribution segments were partially offset by an improvement in sales in the manufacturing segment  resulting in an overall increase in sales of from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the market conditions for the microelectronics market remained positive as indicated by the improved backlog  which increased from in fiscal to  in fiscal sales of burn in systems and burn in boards increased  as did sales derived from fabrication and upgrading customers equipment 
the singapore manufacturing operation was chosen by a customer to be its major supplier to build systems for the testing of microprocessor chips 
this same operation also procured the business of burn in board sales to its new customer 
sales of burn in boards were in fiscal  an increase in quantity sold of with a drop in unit selling price of 
sales of burn in systems were  a increase in quantity sold and a decrease in unit selling price over fiscal even though the average unit selling price decreased for all these products  the dollar volume resulting from the substantial increase in the quantity sold of burn in boards and burn in systems exceeded the dollar volume resulting from the drop in selling price 
the sales of artic temperature controlled chucks contributed to the decrease of due to the decline in both quantity sold and average unit selling price 

table of contents gross margin as a percentage of sales remained relatively flat at  but the dollar volume increased by from in fiscal to  in fiscal  which was consistent with the increase in sales 
another factor which contributed to a flat margin was due to the sale of certain inventories with provision generating zero or little margin 
geographically  net sales into and within the united states region decreased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the drop in demand in the us for front end products from the singapore distribution segment contributed to of the decline 
it was also due in part to the decline in demand for artic temperature controlled chucks as semiconductor equipment capital spending budgets in the us appeared to have been reduced based on lower growth expectations for the second half of in addition  the us manufacturing operation was moved from san jose  california to singapore at the very end of the third quarter  hence there was a temporary lack of bookings for wet process stations while we prepared for the manufacturing process and determined the needs of the customers in this new region 
net sales into and within ireland increased  from in fiscal from  in fiscal responsible for the increase was a boost in programming services in the ireland operation 
net sales into and within the southeast asia region increased by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  as there was higher demand for burn in boards and systems in malaysia and singapore 
operating expenses the operating expenses for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited general and administrative selling research and development impairment loss gain loss on disposal of pp e as a percentage of sales  operating expenses dropped by from in fiscal to in fiscal this was a result of the slight movements in all the operating expense items as a percentage of sales 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased slightly by from in fiscal to in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by from fiscal to fiscal several factors contributed to this reduction  including diminished bonus provisions of in the singapore operation due to unmet bonus payment criteria 
salaries were cut back by in southeast asia and in the united states operation as part of cost cutting measures 
insurance and rental diminished by in universal systems after the operation along with its assets were moved from san jose  california to singapore 
in fiscal  the company granted certain stock options which had an exercise price less than that of the fair market value resulting in a compensation cost 
in fiscal  as all options were granted at fair market value  no similar compensation costs were incurred 
finally  miscellaneous costs fell by this was all offset by higher depreciation of due to renovations and additional purchases of equipment in southeast asia  additional withholding tax of from the malaysia operation  additional provision for doubtful debts of  and incremental telecommunication expenses of due to overseas travel 
additionally  a reversal in provision for contingent liabilities of occurred in the third quarter of fiscal  as a court case was settled in favor of trio tech and we were not liable for the compensation 
no such reversal of provision occurred in likewise  in fiscal corporate officers bonuses in the amount of were paid  whereas in fiscal in bonuses were reversed as the group did not meet its bonus payment criteria 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses increased marginally by  from in fiscal to in selling expenses as a whole increased by one reason for this was an increase in commissions of in the us operation due to a higher number of commissionable sales  and a increase in commissions in singapore manufacturing and distribution for the same reason 
another reason was the higher warranty cost of due to more numerous equipment sales for the singapore manufacturing and distribution segments 
higher travel costs of were incurred in singapore mainly for the purpose of transferring the manufacturing of wet process stations from san jose to singapore 
greater participation in semiconductor shows and conferences resulted in higher trade show costs of for fiscal finally  there was an increase in miscellaneous costs of this was offset with a reduction in salaries of in the southeast asia operation through a reduction in headcount 
also  there was a savings of in salaries in the us as the sales staff at universal systems was laid off in the third quarter of  and a savings in rent and utilities of as this same facility was closed down 
research and development remained relatively flat from fiscal to fiscal 
table of contents the loss on disposal of fixed assets of in fiscal was related to the write off of obsolete burn in facilities in southeast asia in fiscal on the other hand  the gain on disposal of in fiscal was derived from the ireland and thailand operations 
the ireland operation sold equipment which had been written off several years ago  hence enabling us to recognize of the sales proceeds as a total gain for the operation 
also  the thailand operation made a substantial sale of boards to one of its customers  realizing a gain of income loss from operations the income loss from operations for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited manufacturing segment testing segment distribution segment corporate the company turned the operating loss of in fiscal to an operating income of in fiscal the improvement was mainly attributable to the manufacturing and distribution segments  which more than offset the decline in operating income for the testing segment 
the operating loss in the manufacturing segment declined by  from in fiscal to in fiscal the reduction in operating loss resulted in part from the transfer of the universal systems manufacturing operation from san jose to singapore in the third quarter of hence  certain fixed costs which were incurred in fiscal were not repeated in fiscal general administrative costs as a percentage of sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  while selling expenses as a percentage of sales dropped from to  mainly due to the significant rise in sales of 
the decline in general administrative costs of and selling expenses of as a percentage of sales was mainly attributable to universal systems 
after universal systems moved its manufacturing operation  along with all its equipment  to trio tech international pte 
ltd 
in singapore  this resulted in a savings in high fixed costs  such as salaries of  rental of  commissions of  and research and development costs of when compared to fiscal the distribution segment also contributed to the improvement in operating income 
its operating loss decreased by from in fiscal to in fiscal this improvement was mainly due to the change in product mix  which improved gross margin as mentioned earlier 
operating expenses for vibration products and reflow ovens remained similar to those in fiscal which  along with the increase in price  contributed to the decrease in operating loss in the distribution segment 
corporate also contributed to the improvement in the overall operating income 
the corporate office attempts to reimburse its operating expenses by imposing a fee to all subsidiaries on a fixed percentage of total revenue 
due to the increase in singapore manufacturing sales in the fourth quarter  while the rate remained unchanged  the fees collected in fiscal were more than corporate operating expenses 
hence  corporate went from an operating loss of in fiscal to an operating income of in fiscal  an increase of the above were more than enough to offset the decrease in operating income for the testing segment  which declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the testing segment  comprised of fixed and semi fixed costs such as rental  depreciation  and administrative salaries  remained fixed despite the overall decrease in sales 
with the increase in cost of goods sold as mentioned earlier due to higher utilities costs  the operating income declined by interest expense the interest expenses for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited interest expense interest expense decreased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal one reason for this was the lower interest incurred on lines of credit as the singapore and us operations repaid their lines of credit during the end of and the beginning of also  lower interest was incurred on a term loan in the singapore operation as most of its loan was repaid 
offsetting this was the interest from additional borrowings obtained for the building of extensions  burn in systems and other equipment during the year by the singapore operation 

table of contents other income other income for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited other income other income increased from fiscal to fiscal one contributing factor to this was increased rental income due to the leasing out of factories in ireland and malaysia  which contributed another cause was increased net gain on disposal of marketable securities of offsetting these increases was a loss on currency exchange of in versus an exchange gain of in for a total difference of also  we experienced a decrease of in dividends and interest income  a decline in royalty income of  a drop of in sundry income  and a decrease of in miscellaneous income 
income tax the total income tax provision decreased by or  from in fiscal to in fiscal of the change of  there was an increase of related to the current portion of income tax due to the increase of in foreign income tax provision and a decrease of in state income tax provision compared to those in fiscal the rest was related to the deferred portion of income tax benefits 
an increase of in current portion of foreign income tax expense was a result of a tax provision of approximately incurred in the ireland operation due to the gain of on disposal of equipment 
the remaining of the current portion of income tax provision was incurred in the malaysia operation due to the increase in its operating income 
the deferred income tax portion was changed from a provision of in fiscal to a benefit of in fiscal the difference was approximately  which was attributable to a decrease of deferred tax liability incurred mainly in singapore 
the decrease in deferred income tax expense was the result of the timing differences related to the recording of depreciation expenses for book and tax purposes and net operating loss carried forward in singapore and malaysia 
the company did not recognize any income tax benefits related to the net operating losses generated in the us management believes that when the future taxable income exceeds the cumulative losses  it is likely that such benefits will be realized 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the effective income tax rate in fiscal was due to a change from net loss of before income tax to a net income of before income tax  and due to a change in the income tax provision of in fiscal to income tax provision of in fiscal as discussed above  the decrease of deferred tax liability in singapore contributed to the decrease of total income tax provisions  which in turn contributed to the decrease of effective income tax rate 
in addition  the net loss in the us decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal and net income in foreign countries increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  both of which contributed to the decrease of effective income tax rate 
the company files income tax returns in the us  singapore  thailand  malaysia  and ireland  respectively 
income taxes are provided in those countries where taxable income is earned 
income in one country is not offset by losses in another country 
accordingly  no benefit is provided for losses in the countries except where the loss can be carried back against income recognized in previous years 
in essence  the effect of providing tax against taxable income while providing no benefit for losses generated in the us results in an effective tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate 
net loss income as a result of all of the factors analyzed above  the net income for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately  which represented an increase of from a net loss of for fiscal  or a change 
basic earnings per share for fiscal increased to per share from a basic loss per share of in fiscal  which represented an increase of  a change 
diluted earnings per share for fiscal were per share  an increase of per share from a diluted loss per share of for fiscal liquidity and capital resources though the working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities of  as of june  represented a decrease of  or  compared to working capital of  as of june  mainly due to a drop in short term deposits during fiscal  the bulk of it was used for long term investment purposes 
the company acquired fixed assets of located in the new burn in operation in malaysia and  for the purchases of a new plant and machinery and renovation in malaysia and singapore to meet the new customer s requirements 

table of contents the current ratio defined as current assets divided by current liabilities was times as of june  compared to as of june  the decrease in current ratio was due mainly to the decrease in short term deposits of which the most proceeds were used for the investments in the malaysia operation 
we believe that with many years of good cashflow records  the company still has the ability to maintain positive working capital and strong liquidity in the near future 
management believes the company has the economic wherewithal to satisfy any short term funding for several reasons 
our current ratio remained positive at as of june  currently  the singapore operations are financed using short term loans and lines of credit  which are sufficient to meet their needs 
furthermore  the manufacturing operation in san jose  california was moved to singapore and is being operated by the existing singapore personnel 
the relocation eased the need for working capital used to finance that operation 
in addition  we decided to close our testing facility in dublin  ireland subsequent to the fiscal year end  as the operation generated cash only from renting out the property and had not generated net cash from testing services  for the past three years 
we anticipate that the short term funding required in the near future will be for the purchase of equipment as requested by our customers in the amount of approximately and the upgrading of the existing computer system in preparation for the sox audit in the amount of approximately 
in addition  our working capital was tied up due to credit terms extended to a new customer which were longer than the credit terms extended to us from our supplier 
other requirements will be for the new distribution operation in singapore  where we anticipate purchasing greater amounts of raw materials for wet process stations and for new products based on the increased backlog as of june  the company s credit rating provides ready and ample access to funds in global capital markets 
at june   the company had available short term lines of credit totaling  of which  was unused 
entity with facility type of interest expiry dates credit unused bank s prime rate as at june  plus per trio tech malaysia line of credit annum january bank s prime rate as at june  plus per trio tech bangkok line of credit annum october see note of the see note of the financial financial trio tech singapore line of credit statements statements   the company procured long term loans of during fiscal to convert three of the existing facilities in the singapore testing operation for handling the burn in process of the new type of microprocessor chips to improve cost effectiveness 
the singapore testing operation required approximately to set up additional facilities for the burn in services of a faster speed microprocessor chip 
we were able to finance this capital expenditure with our existing term loan 
the malaysia testing operation is in the process of negotiating with the banker for a term loan to finance equipment and upgrade facilities with air conditioning  per customers request 
there were no other capital commitments except those that were disclosed as of june  the following contractual obligations servicing table describes our overall future cash obligations based on various current contracts in the next three years payments due by period at june  less than after total year years years lines of credit notes payable capital leases operating leases 
table of contents fiscal net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was  decreasing by from net cash of  provided by operating activities during fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the following reasons the net impact of adjusting non cash items for fiscal was  compared to for fiscal  whereas the total changes in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal were a negative compared to a positive for fiscal among the non cash items  depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal made a significant impact of  positive cash flow whereas the accounts receivable  other assets  inventories and account payable and accrued liabilities for fiscal made a significant impact of negative cash flow 
management believed that the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was consistent with the decrease in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was  reflecting a decrease of compared to the net cash of  during fiscal the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was attributed mainly to the decrease in purchasing short term deposits in fiscal  as the proceeds from maturing short term deposits were used for capital expenditures and the acquisition of the business in malaysia  which activity did not take place in fiscal in fiscal  the proceeds from maturing short term deposits were less than the cash outflow to invest in short term deposits 
in contrast  the proceeds from maturing short term deposits in fiscal were much more than the proceeds in fiscal  though still not adequate to cover the investment in capital expenditures  short term deposits and acquisition of the business in malaysia 
as all investments in marketable securities had been disposed during fiscal  there were no such proceeds from selling investments in marketable securities during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was  reflecting an increase of compared to the net cash used of during fiscal the increase was due mainly to the increase in borrowings on lines of credit of and lower payments for debts and capital leases of during fiscal compared to net repayments of  for the year ended june  payments were higher in fiscal due to early repayment on a loan in singapore 
the increase in borrowing on lines of credit resulted in fewer proceeds from borrowing through long term debts  noting proceeds from long term debts of in fiscal compare to in fiscal furthermore  the increase in cash provided by financing activities was due to the repayment of on the outstanding line of credit in fiscal whereas there was no such cash outflow in fiscal approximately of short term deposits as of june  were held in the company s owned malaysian subsidiary 
of such amount  was denominated in the currency of malaysia  of which is currently available for movement overseas as authorized by the central bank of malaysia 
there were additional amounts available as dividends after making deductions for income tax pursuant to malaysian regulations 
fiscal net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was  increasing by from net cash of  provided by operating activities during fiscal the increase was primarily due to the following reasons the net impact of adjusting non cash items for fiscal was compared to  for fiscal  whereas the total changes in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal were a positive compared to a negative for fiscal among the non cash items  depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal made a significant impact of  positive cash flow whereas the gain on sales of equipment and marketable securities made a negative impact of on the cash flow 
simultaneously  the accounts payable and accrued liabilities for fiscal made a positive impact of  on the cash flow  which was reduced by other receivables  accounts receivables and inventories of negative cash flow 
management believed that the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was consistent with the increase in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was  reflecting a decrease of  compared to the net cash provided by investing activities of during fiscal the increase in net cash used in investing activities was attributable mainly to the lower proceeds from maturing short term deposits and disposal of marketable securities in fiscal as a result  there were fewer investments in short term deposits and marketable securities in fiscal than in fiscal the proceeds from sales of equipment in fiscal did not help significantly in reducing the impact on cash used in investing activities  and there were no such proceeds in fiscal net cash used in financing activities during fiscal was  reflecting a decrease of  compared to  during fiscal the drop was due mainly to the increase in borrowings on long term debts of and lower payments for lines of credit of during fiscal compared to net repayments of for the year ended june  furthermore  the decrease in cash used in financing activities was due also to the cash received from stock options exercised of in fiscal  whereas there was no such cash received in fiscal in contrast  there were higher payments for debts and capital leases of  during fiscal compared to net repayments of  for the year ended june  
table of contents approximately  of short term deposits as of june  were held in the company s owned malaysian subsidiary

corporate guarantee arrangement the company provides a corporate guarantee to one of its subsidiaries in southeast asia of approximately  to secure line of credit and term loans from a bank to finance the operations of such subsidiary

certain risks that may affect our future results we hereby caution stockholders  prospective investors in trio tech international and other readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our stock price or cause our actual results for the fiscal year ending june  and future fiscal years and quarters to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements  oral or written  made by or on behalf of us 
our operating results are affected by a variety of factors our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially affect revenues and profitability or lead to significant variability of quarterly or annual operating results 
these factors include  among others  components relating to economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry  market acceptance of our products and services  changes in technology in the semiconductor industry  which could affect demand for our products and services  changes in testing processes  the impact of competition  the lack of long term purchase or supply agreements with customers and vendors  changes in military or commercial testing specifications  which could affect the market for our products and services  difficulties in profitably integrating acquired businesses  if any  into the company  the loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled employees  international political or economic events  currency fluctuations  and other technological  economic  financial and regulatory factors beyond our control 
unfavorable changes in these or other factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we may not be able to generate revenue growth and any revenue growth that is achieved may not be sustained 
our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if operating expenses increase and are not subsequently followed by increased revenues 
semiconductor industry cycles affect our business our business depends primarily upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  assemblers and other testing companies worldwide 
these industries in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing semiconductor devices 
the global semiconductor industry generally  and the semiconductor testing equipment industry in particular  are volatile and cyclical  with periodic capacity shortages and excess capacity 
in periods of excess capacity  the industry sharply cuts its purchases of capital equipment  including our distributed products  and reduces testing volumes  including our testing services 
excess capacity also causes downward pressure on the selling prices of our products and services 
our operating results have been adversely affected by past downturns and slowdowns 
there is no assurance that there will not be downturns or slowdowns in the future that may adversely affect our financial condition or operating results 
in addition  if one or more of our primary customers reduces its or their purchases or use of our products or testing services  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
we anticipate that we will continue to be primarily dependent on the semiconductor industry for the foreseeable future 
rapid technological changes may make our products obsolete or result in decreased prices or increased expenses technology changes rapidly in the semiconductor industry and may make our services or products obsolete 
advances in technology may lead to significant price erosion for products which we test with our older testing technologies 
our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and offer more advanced testing technologies and processes in the future  to anticipate both future demand and the technology to supply that demand  to enhance our current products and services  to provide those products and services at competitive prices on a timely and cost effective basis and to achieve market acceptance of those 
table of contents products and services 
to accomplish these goals  we may be required to incur significant engineering expenses 
as new products or services are introduced  we may experience warranty claims or product returns 
we may not be able to accomplish these goals correctly or timely enough 
if we fail in our efforts  our products and services may become less competitive or obsolete 
our dependence on international sales involves significant risk sales and services to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
approximately  and of our net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  were generated from business in southeast asia 
we expect that our non us sales and services will continue to generate the major part of our future revenues 
testing services in southeast asia were performed primarily for american companies  and to a lesser extent german companies  selling products and doing business in those regions 
international business operations may be adversely affected by many factors  including fluctuations in exchange rates  imposition of government controls  trade restrictions  political  economic and business events and social and cultural differences 
we may incur losses due to foreign currency fluctuations significant portions of our revenues are denominated in singapore and euro dollars  malaysian ringgit  thai baht and other currencies 
consequently  a portion of our costs  revenues and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and such foreign currencies 
we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates if there is a mismatch between our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
foreign currency translation adjustments resulted in an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal  an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal and an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal we try to reduce our risk of foreign currency fluctuations by purchasing certain equipment and supplies in us dollars and seeking payment  when possible  in us dollars 
however  we may not be successful in our attempts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
those fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
we do not rely on patents to protect our products or technology we hold us patents relating to our pressurization humidity testing equipment and certain aspects of our artic temperature test systems 
additionally  in fiscal  we were granted patents for certain aspects of our new ranges of artic temperature controlled chucks 
however  although we believe our patents are integral to our business  generally we do not rely on patent or trade secret protection for our products or technology 
competitors may develop technologies similar to or more advanced than ours 
we cannot assure that our current or future products will not be copied or will not infringe on the patents of others 
moreover  the cost of litigation of any claim or damages resulting from infringement of patents or other intellectual property could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intense competition can adversely affect our operating results the semiconductor equipment and testing industries are intensely competitive 
significant competitive factors include price  technical capabilities  quality  automation  reliability  product availability and customer service 
we face competition from established and potential new competitors  many of whom have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than our resources 
new products or testing facilities offered by our competitors could cause a decline in our revenues or a loss of market acceptance of our existing products and services 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price based competition 
price based competition may result in lower prices  adversely affecting our operating results 
loss  reduction or delay of orders from significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition the semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated  with a relatively small number of large manufacturers and assemblers accounting for a substantial portion of our revenues from product sales and testing revenues 
our experience has been that sales to particular customers may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in fiscal   and  sales of equipment and services to our three largest customers accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our net revenues 
this applies in particular to our new testing operation in malaysia  which currently has only one major customer 
in the event that the company loses this customer  all the capital purchases to meet this customer s requirement will be converted to support other products 
our ability to maintain close  satisfactory relationships with our customers is essential to our stability and growth 
the loss of or reduction or delay in orders from our significant customers  or delays in collecting accounts receivable from our significant customers  could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents there is a limited market for our testing products and services if testing equipment is purchased by semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers  it may reduce the likelihood that they will make further purchases of such equipment or use our laboratories for testing services 
although military or other specifications require certain testing to be done by independent laboratories  over time other current customers may have less need for our testing services 
we believe that there is a growing trend toward outsourcing of the integrated circuit test process 
as a result  we anticipate continued growth in the test laboratory business 
however  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
in an attempt to diversify our sales mix  we may seek to develop and introduce new or advanced products  and to acquire other companies in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing business 
acquisition and integration of new businesses could disrupt our ongoing business  distract management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our business a portion of any future growth may be accomplished through the acquisition of other entities 
the success of those acquisitions will depend  in part  on our ability to integrate the acquired personnel  operations  products  services and technologies into our organization  to retain and motivate key personnel of the acquired entities and to retain the customers of those entities 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  obtain financing on acceptable terms to bring the acquisition to fruition or to integrate such personnel  operations  products or services 
the process of identifying and closing acquisition opportunities and integrating acquisitions into our operations may distract our management and employees  disrupt our ongoing business  increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our operations 
we may also be subject to certain other risks if we acquire other entities  such as the assumption of additional liabilities 
we may issue additional equity securities or incur debt to pay for future acquisitions 
we do not have contracts with key suppliers we have no written contracts with any of our suppliers 
our suppliers may terminate their relationship with us at any time without notice 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to find satisfactory replacement suppliers or that new suppliers would not be more expensive than the current suppliers if any of our suppliers were to terminate their relationship with us 
we are highly dependent on key personnel our success has depended  and  to a large extent will depend  on the continued services of sw yong  our chief executive officer and president  victor h 
m 
ting  our vice president and chief financial officer  our other key senior executives  and engineering  marketing  sales  production and other personnel 
we do not have an employment agreement with mr 
yong or mr 
ting  but we are the beneficiary of key man life insurance in the amount of million on mr 
yong and million on mr 
ting 
the loss of these key personnel  who would be difficult to replace  could harm our business and operating results 
competition for management in our industry is intense and we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the executive management and other key personnel that we require 
our management has significant influence over corporate decisions currently our officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock  including options held by them that are exercisable within days of the date of filing of this k 
as a result  they may be able to significantly influence matters requiring approval of the shareholders  including the election of directors  and may be able to delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
we have not paid cash dividends we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we anticipate that the future earnings  if any  will be retained for use in the business or for other corporate purposes 
additionally  california law prohibits the payment of dividends if the company does not have sufficient retained earnings or cannot meet certain asset to liability ratios 
the company presently intends to sell the real property it owns in ireland 
however  as of the date of filing of this annual report  the company has not entered into any agreement or letter of intent with respect thereto and thus does not know whether the property will be sold or  if so  the purchase price therefor or the net proceeds that may derive therefrom 
assuming that the company sells the real property and that there are net proceeds therefrom  we may consider using the net proceeds therefrom for a variety of purposes  which may but need not include payment of a cash dividend 
due to the restrictions on the payment of dividends under california law  and based on the fact that the company has no agreement to sell the property and thus cannot at this time analyze whether or not a dividend would be advisable or permitted under law  the company is not able at this time to advise whether or not a cash dividend may be declared in the foreseeable future and there is no assurance that any dividend will be declared or paid or  if declared  the amount thereof 
aside from the possibility of the declaration of a dividend following sale of the ireland property as described in this paragraph  it is anticipated that no dividends will be paid to holders of common stock in the foreseeable future 

table of contents possible dilutive effect of outstanding options as of june   there were  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options 
the outstanding options are currently exercisable at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
we anticipate that the trading price of our common stock at the time of exercise of any such outstanding options will exceed the exercise price under those options 
thus such exercise will have a dilutive effect on our shareholders 
the market price for our common stock is subject to fluctuation the trading price of our common stock has from time to time fluctuated widely 
the trading price may similarly fluctuate in the future in response to quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor industry and other events or factors 
in addition  in recent years  broad stock market indices in general  and the securities of technology companies in particular  have experienced substantial price fluctuations on a daily basis 
fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock may adversely affect our liquidity 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of cash deposits 
our policy is to place these investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate and thus subject us to market risk due to those fluctuations 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio  though no assurances can be given that material losses will not occur 
the interest on our loans and lines of credit range from to per annum 
as of june   the outstanding aggregate principal balance on these loans and lines of credit was approximately  these interest rates are subject to change and we cannot predict an increase or decrease in rates  if any
