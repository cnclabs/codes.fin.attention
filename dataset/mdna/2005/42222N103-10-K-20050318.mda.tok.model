this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
healthstream s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed and those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to  those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion provides an overview of our history together with a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition  product development costs and related capitalization  impairment of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
overview healthstream was incorporated in and began marketing its internet based solutions in march the company focuses on being a facilitator of solutions and training tools for entities in the healthcare industry 
revenues from the healthcare organizations business unit hco are derived from the following categories provision of services through our internet based healthstream learning center  courseware subscriptions  a variety of complimentary online products  and maintenance and support of installed learning management products 
revenues from the pharmaceutical and medical device company business unit pmd are derived from live event development  online training and content development  and other educational and training services 

table of contents to date  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technologies  create  license  update  and acquire our content  build brand awareness  develop our infrastructure and expand our business  and only recently achieved sufficient revenues to generate a net profit or positive operating cash flows 
we have incurred operating losses in each fiscal quarter from through the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of we had net income of approximately  we expect our operating results to continue to improve over prior year levels during critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenues from our internet based learning products and courseware subscriptions to healthcare workers through healthcare organizations based on a per person subscription basis  with fees ranging from less than to more than per month 
these fees are based on the size of the facilities or organizations employee user population and the service offerings to which they subscribe 
contracts for our internet based learning products generally range from less than  to approximately  based on the number of users  products and services included and the duration of the contract 
revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the underlying contract 
revenues associated with content maintenance services are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
we offer training services for clients to facilitate integration of this technology 
fees for training are based on the time and efforts of the personnel involved 
training revenues are generally recognized upon completion of training services 
basic online training is generally included in the initial contract  however  incremental training is recognized upon completion 
revenues from installed learning management products are associated with ongoing maintenance and technical support services  typically based on a percentage of the original contract amount and recognized as revenue over the term of the service period  generally one year 
until early  we also had revenues related to sales of installed learning management products  which were recognized based upon shipment or installation of the software 
we have and expect to continue to transition customers from our existing installed learning management products to our internet based learning products 
we expect that revenues resulting from these transition customers will increase when compared to the annual maintenance and technical support services fees due to sales of additional services and online courseware 
we recognize revenue from live event development services and online training and content development services based on the percentage of completion method using labor hours or similar performance milestones 
this methodology requires ongoing estimates regarding the total expenses or significant milestones associated with the project as well as periodic estimates of the progress with respect to completion of such projects 
event registration services revenue is based on the contracted services including the expected registrant attendance 
revenues for these services are recognized upon completion of the related events 
sales of products and services to pharmaceutical and medical device companies can be subject to seasonal factors as a result of drug and product introductions  meeting and conference dates and budget cycles for such companies 
revenues associated with online training are recognized over the term of the subscription period or over the historical usage period  if usage typically differs from the subscription period 
all other service revenues are recognized as the related services are performed or products are delivered 
we expect to continue to generate revenues by marketing our internet based products and services to healthcare workers through healthcare organizations and pharmaceutical and medical device companies 
we expect that the portion of our revenues related to services provided via our internet based learning products will increase 
specifically  we will seek to generate revenues from healthcare workers by marketing to their employers or sponsoring organizations 
the fees we charge for courseware resulting from this marketing is typically paid by either the employer or sponsoring organization 
product development costs product development costs primarily include our internal costs to maintain and internally develop software features and content for our internet based learning and installed learning management products 
once technological feasibility is achieved  we capitalize payments to third parties associated with the cost of features or content where the life expectancy is greater than one year and the anticipated cash flows from such features or content are expected to exceed the related cost of the features or content 
during and  we capitalized approximately  and  respectively  related to content development completed by third parties 
such amounts are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under the caption prepaid development fees and other assets based on remaining useful lives 
during and  we capitalized approximately  and  respectively  of software feature enhancements 
such amounts are included in the accompanying balance sheets under the caption prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets based on remaining useful lives 
we amortize content and feature development over the expected life  
table of contents which is generally one to three years 
product development and content development costs that have been capitalized are subject to a periodic impairment review in accordance with our policy 
product development costs also include our systems team  which manages our efforts associated with product development and maintenance  database management  quality assurance and security 
this team is responsible for new internal product development  integration of external new products  and continued enhancements and regularly scheduled maintenance called servicepacks to our platform 
we account for web site development costs in accordance with eitf issue no 
accounting for web site development costs  which provides guidance on when to capitalize versus expense costs incurred to develop a web site 
we capitalize costs incurred between the point of establishing technological feasibility and general release when such costs are material 
in connection with product development  our significant estimates involve the assessment of technological feasibility for new products  as well as the expected useful life of costs associated with new products and content 
once capitalized  product and content development costs are subject to the policies and estimates described below regarding goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we account for goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we measure for impairment at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
our discounted cash flow model contains significant assumptions and accounting estimates about discount rates  future cash flows and terminal values that could materially affect our operating results or financial position if they were to change significantly in the future 
we perform our goodwill impairment test whenever events or changes in facts or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and also during the fourth quarter each year 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts using both a specific and non specific identification method 
management s evaluation includes reviewing past due accounts on a case by case basis  and determining whether an account should be reserved  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each potentially uncollectible account 
an allowance is also maintained for accounts not specifically identified that may become uncollectible in the future 
uncollectible accounts are written off in the period management believes it has exhausted every opportunity to collect payment from the customer 
bad debt expense is recorded when events or circumstances indicate an additional allowance is necessary based on our specific identification approach

revenues from sales of products and services to pharmaceutical and medical device companies can be subject to seasonal factors as a result of timing of conferences and live events as well as drug and product introductions and budget cycles for such companies 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations largely through proceeds from our ipo  private placements of equity securities  loans from related parties and  to an increasing extent  from revenues generated from the sale of our products and services 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately  during compared to approximately million used in operating activities during the improvement in cash consumption primarily resulted from our improved operating results as indicated by the million decline in our net loss  which was offset by an increase in accounts and unbilled receivables of million and prepaid development fees of  the number of days sales outstanding dso for was days compared to days for this increase was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable associated with the timing of billings at the end of the company calculates dso by dividing the accounts receivable balance excluding unbilled and other receivables by average daily revenues for the year 
the primary uses of cash for were to fund operations and purchases of content and feature enhancements 
the primary uses of cash for were to fund operations and payout of employee bonuses that were earned in 
table of contents net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in while approximately  was provided by investing activities in investments in marketable securities during and were primarily comprised of auction rate securities  which typically trade on a monthly basis

also during  we received proceeds of approximately  from the repayment of a note receivable related party 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  and  during and  respectively 
the primary sources of cash for both and resulted from proceeds associated with the issuance of common stock from both the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  offset by payments under capital lease obligations 
as of december   our primary source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments in marketable securities  and related interest receivable 
we have no bank credit facility or other indebtedness other than capital lease obligations 
as of february   we had cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments and related interest receivable of approximately million 
the primary increase in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments in marketable securities  and related interest receivable since december  resulted from the receipt of grant funds from commercial supporters 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments in marketable securities and related interest receivable will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital  new product development  capital expenditures and acquisitions for at least the next months 
as part of our growth strategy  we are actively reviewing possible acquisitions that complement our products and services 
we anticipate that these acquisitions  if any  will be effected through a combination of stock and cash consideration 
the issuance of stock as consideration for an acquisition could have a dilutive effect on our stock price 
failure to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or raise additional capital when required during or following any potential acquisitions in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
commitments and contingencies we expect that our capital expenditures and content purchases will be approximately million in from january  through february   we had capital expenditures of approximately  primarily related to hardware and software additions 
in january  we entered into a capital lease for computer hardware  in which total estimated payments are approximately  over a three year term 
our strategic alliances have typically provided for payments to content partners based on revenues and development partners and other parties based on services rendered 
we expect to continue similar arrangements in the future 
in addition to these commitments  we have capital lease obligations and operating lease commitments for our operating facilities in nashville  tn and denver  co  and a closed facility in dallas  tx 
a summary of future anticipated payments for commitments and other contractual obligations are outlined below payments due by period less than year years years more than years total capital lease obligations operating leases purchase commitments other contractual obligations total purchase commitments include minimum purchases for copy center services and computer software 
other contractual obligations consist of fixed commitments resulting from agreements with various business partners

 share based payments 
statement supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and will require companies to recognize compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to share based payments  including stock options 
the statement is effective in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  the company intends to adopt statement in the third quarter of  and to implement it on a prospective basis 
we are currently assessing the impact the statement will have on our consolidated results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which amends apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb  accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the amendment made by statement eliminates the exception for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the provisions of the statement are effective for exchanges taking place in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
