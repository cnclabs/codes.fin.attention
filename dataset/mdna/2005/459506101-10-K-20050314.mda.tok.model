the precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented  both geographically and along product lines  there are few publicly traded companies in the industry  certain customers maintain in house capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs  and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited 
analysts generally estimate the global market to be billion of which iff represents  the company s nearest sized competitor is of similar size

the flavor and fragrance industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions

the company bears essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are protected under trade secrecy 
the company is not materially dependent on any patents  trademarks or licenses 
the company s strategic focus in the three year period has been o to integrate bush boake allen inc bba  acquired in november  and to reorganize the integrated organization under two global umbrellas of business development and operations 
business development encompasses consumer and market research  product category strategy  product development  global sales and marketin g and technical application 
operations are responsible for the customer supply chain 
o to improve customer service  in terms of both on time deliveries and responsiveness to new product development initiatives  and to improve the win rate for new business with the company s customers 
o to critically evaluate the profitability and growth potential of the company s product portfolio  and to focus on those categories and customers considered to be the best opportunities for long term profitable growth 
o to focus research and development initiatives on those areas considered to be most likely  in the long term  to yield the greatest value to the company s customers and shareholders 
in the three year period ended december   considerable progress against these strategic initiatives was made 
the bba integration was completed quickly and associated savings exceeded those anticipated at the time the acquisition was announced

the company has exited certain non core businesses  contributing to improved returns on sales and invested capital  the last of these businesses wa s sold in the quality and depth of the company s research and development efforts have improved significantly 
in and  the company patented numerous new  commercially viable ingredients for use in flavors and fragrances fifteen were patented in and nine in a number of these ingredients were used in flavor and fragrance compounds in and in new product introductions will play an important role in meeting our growth objectives 
moving forward  the company is committed to o continuous improvement in operations and customer service supported by the global implementation of the enterprise requirements planning software package sap  and related initiatives 
o research and development efforts in those aspects of flavors and fragrances and associated delivery mechanisms which the company has identified as most likely to drive profitable future growth 
the company anticipates that much of this research will be conducted internally  but such efforts may be augmented by joint research undertakings and through acquisition of technology 
an essential aspect of the overall research efforts is the company s continued leadership in sensory science and consumer insight  enabling the creation of consumer preferred flavors and fragrances 
as implementation of the strategy progresses  setting strategic initiative s requires regular establishment and reassessment of identified priorities and necessitates choices in order to provide the best opportunity for continuous improvement in shareholder value

the inflation rate assumed in the model was 
the plan has achieved a compound rate of return of over the previous years 
the expected rate of return for the non us plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments  inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements 
discount rates used to determine future pension obligations of all plans are based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high rating by a recognized rating agency wher e the maturity of the bonds reasonably match the demographics of plan participants 
the rate of compensation expense for all plans and th e medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience
