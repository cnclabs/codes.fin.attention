all statements other than statements of historical information provided herein are forward looking statements and may contain information about financial results  economic conditions  trends and known uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  which include those discussed in this section and elsewhere in this report under the heading risk factors that may affect future results and the risks discussed in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis  judgment  belief or expectation only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
overview we provide our services to customers typically pursuant to agreements with a term of one to three years and monthly payment installments 
as a result  these agreements provide us with a base of recurring revenue 
our revenue increases by adding new customers or additional services to existing customers 
our overall base of recurring revenue is affected by new customers  renewals or terminations of agreements with existing customers 
a large portion of the costs to operate our data centers  such as rent  product development and general and administrative expenses  does not depend strictly on the number of customers or the amount of services we provide 
as we add new customers or new services to existing customers  we generally incur limited additional expenses relating to telecommunications  utilities  hardware and software costs  and payroll expenses 
we have substantial capacity to add customers to our data centers 
our relatively fixed cost base  sufficient capacity for expansion and limited incremental variable costs provide us with the opportunity to grow profitably 
however  these same fixed costs present us with the risk that we may incur losses if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue 
in recent years  we have grown through acquisitions of new businesses and have restructured our historical operations 
specifically  in december  we acquired clearblue technologies management  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of our majority stockholder at the time of the acquisition and therefore was accounted for as a common control merger  adding application management and development capabilities to our managed application services 
in february  we acquired avasta  adding capabilities to our managed application services 
in april  we acquired conxion  providing key services to our managed application services and managed infrastructure services 
in may  we acquired assets of interliant  forming the core of our managed messaging services 
in august and april  we acquired assets of cbt which was our majority stockholder at that time and therefore was accounted for as a common control merger related to colocation  bandwidth  security and disaster recovery services  enhancing our managed infrastructure services 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of surebridge adding significant capabilities to our managed application and professional services 
prior to september  substantially all of our services were managed application services 
we have added managed infrastructure and managed messaging services and increased managed applications and professional services since that time 
this transformation in our business will result in our recent results being more relevant to an understanding of our business than our historical results 
we also expect to make additional acquisitions to take advantage of our available capacity  which will have significant effects on our financial results in the future 
our acquisitions of cbtm and the assets and certain liabilities of cbt were accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interest due to common control ownership 
the assets and the liabilities of cbt  
table of contents cbtm and navisite were combined at their historical amounts beginning on september   the date on which cbt obtained a majority ownership of navisite 
our acquisitions of avasta and conxion and selected assets of interliant were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and as such  the results of operations and cash flows relating to these acquisitions were included in our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statement of cash flows from their respective dates of acquisition of february   april  and may  our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of surebridge was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations and cash flows relating to this acquisition have been included in our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statement of cash flows from its acquisition date of june  the audit report on our fiscal year consolidated financial statements from kpmg llp  our independent registered public accounting firm  contains kpmg s opinion that our recurring losses from operations since inception and accumulated deficit  as well as other factors  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
while we cannot assure you that we will continue as a going concern  we believe that we have developed and are implementing an operational plan that aligns our cost structure with our projected revenue growth 
results of operations for the three years ended july   and the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated

total revenue for fiscal year increased to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal year the overall growth in revenue was mainly due to the full year impact of the revenue resulting from our fiscal year acquisition of surebridge which contributed approximately million in revenue during the year ended july  the increased revenue during fiscal year was partially offset by net lost customer revenue of approximately million

included in total cost of revenue for fiscal year are impairment and restructuring charges totaling million

the decrease in product development expense of approximately million is primarily related to salary expense resulting from a decreased headcount 
product development expense increased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year and represented approximately of total revenue in both fiscal years 
the increase in product development expense of approximately million is primarily related to increased salary expense resulting from an increased headcount

selling and marketing expense increased to approximately million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year from approximately million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year the increase of approximately million resulted primarily from approximately million of increased salary expense resulting from an increased headcount of selling personnel  as well as increases of million in travel costs  million in partner referral fees  million in recruitment fees and million in marketing program costs

income tax expense the company recorded million of deferred income tax expense during the fiscal year ended july   as compared to no deferred income tax expense during fiscal year no income tax benefit was recorded for the losses incurred due to a valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax expense resulted from tax goodwill amortization related to the cbtm and surebridge acquisitions 
for tax purposes  the acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions 
accordingly  the acquired goodwill and intangible assets are amortized for tax purposes over years 
for financial statement purposes  goodwill is not amortized  but annually is tested for impairment 
tax amortization of goodwill results in a taxable temporary difference  which will not reverse until the goodwill is impaired or written off 
the resulting taxable temporary difference may not be offset by deductible temporary differences currently available  such as net operating loss carryforwards  which expire within a definite period 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of july   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents and our financing agreement with silicon valley bank 
we had a working capital deficit of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million at july   as compared to a working capital deficit of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  at july  the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended july  was an increase of million 
our primary sources of cash during fiscal year were million from operating activities  million in proceeds from the mbs transaction  in proceeds from the sale of equipment  a million decrease in restricted cash  million in proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options under the employee stock option plans  and million in proceeds from notes payable 
net cash provided by operating activities of million during the fiscal year ended july   resulted primarily from million of net changes in operating assets and liabilities and non cash charges of million  partially offset by the funding of our million net loss 
the primary uses of cash during fiscal year included million of cash used for purchases of property and equipment and million in repayments on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
at july   we had an accumulated deficit of million  and have reported losses from operations since incorporation 
at july   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our accounts receivable financing line with silicon valley bank svb allows for maximum borrowing of million and expires on april  on july   we had an outstanding balance under the amended agreement of million 
borrowings are based on monthly recurring revenue 
we are required to prepare and deliver a written request for an advance of up to three times the value of total recurring monthly revenue  calculated to be monthly revenue including revenue from the new york state department of labor less professional services revenue 
svb may then provide an advance of of such value or such other percentage as the bank may determine 
the interest rate under the amended agreement is variable and is currently calculated at the bank s published prime rate plus 
the financing agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants and is secured by substantially all of our assets  tangible and intangible 
following the completion of certain equity or debt financings  and provided we continue to meet certain ratios  the interest rate shall be reduced to the bank s prime rate plus 
in no event  however  will the bank s prime rate be less than 
the accounts receivable financing line at july  and july  is reported net of the remaining value ascribed to the related warrants of million and million  respectively 
at july   the company had million in outstanding standby letters of credit  issued in connection with facility and equipment lease agreements and other credit agreements  which are cash collateralized 
cash subject to collateral requirements has been recorded as restricted cash on our balance sheet at july  and july  the company had restricted cash of million  including million which is classified as short term and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet  at july  and million at july  we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in the future 
we have taken several actions we believe will allow us to continue as a going concern  including closing and integrating strategic acquisitions  making changes to our senior management and bringing costs more in line with projected revenue 
we will need to find sources of additional financing  or refinance or restructure our existing indebtedness  in order to remain a going concern 
in september  we engaged financial advisors to assist us in refinancing our debt and  while there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our refinancing efforts  we believe we will conclude this process within the next days 
we are obligated to use a significant portion of any proceeds raised in an equity or debt financing or by sales of assets to make payments on the notes payable to waythere  inc  depending on the total net proceeds received by us in the financing see note e to our consolidated financial statements 
our operating forecast incorporates growth projections from industry analysts for the markets in which we participate 
our forecast also incorporates the future cash flow benefits expected from our continued efforts to increase efficiencies and reduce redundancies 
nonetheless  our forecast includes the need to raise additional funds 
our cash flow estimates are based upon attaining certain levels of sales  maintaining budgeted levels of 
table of contents operating expenses  collections of accounts receivable and maintaining our current borrowing line with silicon valley bank among other assumptions  including the improvement in the overall macroeconomic environment 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet such assumptions 
our operating forecast does not depend upon our ability to make additional acquisitions which could be impacted by our current stock price 
our sales estimate includes revenue from new and existing customers  which may not be realized  and we may be required to further reduce expenses if budgeted sales are not attained 
we may be unsuccessful in reducing expenses in proportion to any shortfall in projected sales and our estimate of collections of accounts receivable may be hindered by our customers ability to pay 
in addition  we are currently involved in various pending and potential legal proceedings 
while we believe that the allegations against us in each of these matters are without merit  and or that we have a meritorious defense in each  we are not able to predict the final outcomes of any of these matters and the effect  if any  on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
if we are ultimately unsuccessful in any of these matters  we could be required to pay substantial amounts of cash to the other parties 
the amount and timing of any such payments could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated under various capital and operating leases for facilities and equipment 
future minimum annual rental commitments under capital and operating leases and other commitments  as of july   are as follows less than more than description total year years years years in thousands short long term debt   a interest on debt b capital leases operating leases bandwidth commitments maintenance for hardware software property leases c d a amount includes the outstanding balance on the accounts receivable financing line as of july  b amounts do not include interest on the accounts receivable financing line  as interest rate is variable 
c amounts exclude certain common area maintenance and other property charges that are not included within the lease payment 
d on february   the company entered into an assignment and assumption agreement with a las vegas based company  whereby this company acquired from us the right to use  square feet in our las vegas data center  along with the infrastructure and equipment associated with this space 
in exchange  we received an initial payment of  and will receive  per month over two years 
this agreement shifts the responsibility for management of the data center and its employees  along with the maintenance of the facility s infrastructure  to this las vegas based company 
pursuant to this agreement  we have subleased back  square feet of space  allowing us to continue servicing our existing customer base in this market 
commitments related to property leases include an amount related to the  square feet sublease 
off balance sheet financing arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases  which are recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews the estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experiences  current conditions and future expectations 
the reviews are performed regularly and adjustments are made as required by current available information 
we believe these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue consists of monthly fees for web site and internet application management  hosting  colocation and professional services 
the company also derives revenue from the sale of software and related maintenance contracts 
reimbursable expenses charged to clients are included in revenue and cost of revenue 
application management  hosting and colocation revenue is billed and recognized over the term of the contract  generally one to three years  based on actual usage 
installation fees associated with application management  hosting and colocation revenue is billed at the time the installation service is provided and recognized over the term of the related contract 
payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period such services are provided 
revenue from professional services is recognized on either a time and material basis as the services are performed or under the percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts 
we generally sell our professional services under contracts with terms ranging up to five years 
when current contract estimates indicate that a loss is probable  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated service costs of the contract exceed the estimated revenue that will be generated by the contract 
unbilled accounts receivable represents revenue for services performed that have not been billed 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue from the sale of software is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fees are fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in instances where the company also provides application management and hosting services in conjunction with the sale of software  software revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the expected customer relationship period 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors 
if it is determined subsequent to our initial evaluation and at any time during the arrangement that collectability is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized as cash is received 
due to the nature of our service arrangements  we provide written notice of termination of services  typically days in advance of disconnecting a customer 
revenue for services rendered during this notification period is generally recognized on a cash basis as collectability is not considered probable at the time the services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally do not require collateral or other security against trade receivables 
we make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and consider historical bad debts  customer and industry concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we specifically reserve for of the balance of customer accounts deemed uncollectible 
for all other customer accounts  we reserve for of the balance over days old and of all other customer balances 
changes in economic conditions or the financial viability of our customers may result in additional provisions for doubtful accounts in excess of our current estimate 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  subject to amortization and depreciation  including customer lists and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are valued at the lower of the carrying amount or their fair value less disposal costs 
property and equipment is primarily comprised of leasehold improvements  computer and office equipment and software licenses 
intangible assets consist of customer lists 
we review the valuation of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred  we review the valuation of goodwill on an interim basis 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
impairment losses are recognized in operations

 accounting for stock based compensation 
as a result of the provisions of sfas r and sab  we currently expect to record compensation charges related to stock options in the range of approximately million to million in fiscal however  our assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 

table of contents these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
as such  our actual stock option expense may differ materially from this estimate
