item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis  including those related to uncollectible receivables  inventories  goodwill and long lived assets  warranty obligations  environmental liabilities and deferred taxes 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on accounts receivable resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
such allowances are based on an ongoing review of customer payments against terms and a review of customer financial statements and financial information 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we maintain reserves to write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  less costs to sell  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would result in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income being greater than expected in the period in which more information becomes available 
intangible assets we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal accordingly  we no longer amortize goodwill from acquisitions 
we continue to amortize other acquisition related intangibles  which are not significant to our consolidated balance sheets 
as required by sfas  we perform an impairment test annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
certain factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or our overall business and significant industry or economic trends 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future sales  sales growth rates  gross margins  expense and capital expenditure levels  the discount rate and estimated terminal values to determine the fair value of the operating entities should an impairment exist 
changes in these and other factors could result in impairments in the carrying value of goodwill  which would require a write down to the asset s fair value 
warranty obligations we offer certain warranties with the sale of our products 
the warranty obligation is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet and is estimated through historical customer claims  product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
changes in these factors and changes in statutory requirements for product warranties in markets in which we sell our products may require an adjustment to the recorded warranty obligations 
environmental liabilities we accrue environmental remediation and litigation costs if it is probable a liability has been incurred at the financial statement date and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
our liability for environmental costs  other than for costs of assessments themselves  are generally determined after the completion of investigations and studies and are based on the estimated cost of remediation activities we are then required to undertake 
the gross liability is based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations  as well as our own historical experience regarding environmental cleanup costs 
the reliability and precision of the estimates are affected by numerous factors  such as site evaluation and reevaluation of the degree of remediation required  claims by third parties and changes to environmental laws and regulations 
we adjust our liabilities as new remediation requirements are defined  as information becomes available permitting reasonable estimates to be made and to reflect new facts 
deferred taxes our provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment 
we are subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the taxes paid to these jurisdictions are subject to audit  although to date the results of any tax audits have been minor 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carryforwards  will not be realized 
we have recorded on our consolidated balance sheets a valuation allowance against various deferred tax assets 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged against income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
we continually evaluate strategies that could allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets 
benefit plans we make a number of assumptions with regard to both future financial conditions and future actions by plan participants to calculate on an actuarial basis the amount of income or expense and assets and liabilities recognized in association with our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
these assumptions include the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  health care cost trend rates and expected rates of retirement for plan participants 
we review the assumptions on an annual basis and makes changes to reflect market conditions and the administration of the plans 
while we believe the current assumptions are appropriate in the circumstances  actual results and changes in these assumptions in the future will result in adjustments which could impact the income or expense recognized in future years in relation to these plans 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal consolidated summary net income for fiscal increased to million per diluted share from million per diluted share in fiscal this increase is primarily due to net sales growth of  excluding currency gains 
additional net sales from acquired companies contributed almost  while foreign currency fluctuations added nearly to net sales 
north america  europe and asia pacific all experienced net sales growth of slightly over during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to higher volumes of shipments and sales price increases 
gross margin slipped slightly in fiscal due primarily to increases in raw material costs offsetting sales increases 
operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from to  aided in part by income of million from an insurance litigation settlement 
lower debt levels in fiscal resulted in lower interest charges than in fiscal north america year ended january change change in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative amortization insurance litigation recovery environmental expense operating income net sales in north america increased million or in fiscal to million 
increased volume of shipments from north american facilities as well as price increases accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining increase is due to the change in foreign currency rates between the us and canadian dollar 
historically  we have found that changes in the level of our net sales do not correspond directly to the percentage changes in lift truck industry shipments  but industry statistics do provide an indication of the direction of business activity 
north american lift truck industry shipments from to increased 
we have maintained or increased our overall existing market share in north america during fiscal north america s gross margin increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this increase is due primarily to increased shipments and better absorption of fixed costs and price increases in fiscal this benefit is somewhat offset by higher raw material costs and the sale in the united states of certain products manufactured in canada 
sales of these products are in us dollars but a significant portion of the costs are in canadian dollars 
during  the value of the us dollar against the canadian dollar decreased 
selling and administrative costs for fiscal increased or million over fiscal excluding the effects of currency changes  these costs increased or million  driven primarily by higher levels of incentive pay  professional fees and sales commissions 
the increase in amortization expense is exclusively due to stock appreciation rights sars 
we issued  sars  which vest over four years  to key executives and directors under the cascade stock appreciation rights plan plan approved by shareholders in may see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussions about the plan 
the sars amortization is influenced by two factors  the market price of our common stock at the end of the reporting period relative to the market price at the date of grant and the method for recognizing the related compensation cost 
during the period from the date of grant  may  to january  the market price of our common stock increased per share  from per share to per share 
this resulted in deferred compensation of million recorded as additional paid in capital 
we are amortizing the deferred compensation over the four year vesting period 
we have amortized million of deferred compensation during the year ended january  assuming no change in the market price of our common stock at january   the unamortized deferred compensation of million would result in amortization expense of million  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
annual or quarterly increases in our common stock during fiscal  and would result in additional amortization expenses 
correspondingly for quarterly or annual periods ending after january   any decreases in the market price of our common stock after january  will result in the reversal of previously recognized amortization expense 
in addition  future grants will also impact earnings depending on changes in the price of our common stock 
see recent accounting pronouncements for further discussion regarding the impact of new accounting principles on sars accounting 
europe year ended january change change in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative amortization operating loss europe s fiscal net sales increased or million in comparison with fiscal increased product shipments and price increases contributed million to this increase 
changes in foreign currency rates  related primarily to the euro  accounted for or million of the increase 
acquisitions in germany and italy over the last two years added million to fiscal sales or of the increase 
the overall european lift truck market has improved in fiscal with year to date orders and shipments increasing approximately 
our increase in sales for certain oem products has exceeded the market increase in lift truck orders and shipments  while the increase in other products has fallen below the industry trends 
the current market in europe continues to be very competitive 
our european competitors are generally smaller privately held companies  some of which have a global presence 
we believe the acquisitions in italy and germany over the last two years provide a solid operating base to build market share and compete more effectively in key european markets 
we previously only had a limited presence in these markets 
gross margins in europe were for fiscal  down slightly from the fiscal gross margin of 
this decrease is due primarily to increases in the cost of steel 
we were not able to sufficiently offset the cost increases with customer price increases across all product lines 
selling and administrative costs for fiscal increased or million over fiscal acquisitions added million of selling and administrative costs 
higher warranty costs and information technology costs to integrate acquired locations and implement sarbanes oxley accounted for million or of the increase 
the remaining increase relates to currency changes 
in addition to completing acquisitions in and  we have taken several steps we believe will have a positive impact on future profitability in europe 
these include the introduction of new products  rationalization of existing manufacturing operations to reduce overall costs and more aggressive marketing campaigns in select markets 
asia pacific year ended january change change in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative amortization operating income asia pacific net sales grew by or million in fiscal over fiscal excluding currency changes  net sales increased or million 
a significant portion of this increase relates to sales in china 
overall sales in china grew in fiscal  but still only account for approximately of our consolidated net sales 
substantially all of our products manufactured in china are currently sold within that country 
we have experienced increased competition over the past years in certain key markets  particularly china 
we are working to maintain our market share in china with increased marketing and sales activities 
gross margins were in fiscal  consistent with fiscal selling and administrative costs in asia pacific for fiscal increased over fiscal excluding the effect of foreign currency changes  the increase was from fiscal  primarily due to marketing activities and additional business in china 
non operating items our interest expense in fiscal decreased in comparison with fiscal the decrease is due to lower overall debt levels 
see financial condition and liquidity for additional discussion of company debt levels and payments 
consolidated interest income decreased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the receipt of payment in full of notes receivable related to the sale of our hydraulic cylinder division during late fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal increased to in comparison to in fiscal the increase is due to a reduction in the benefit received from international financing 
on october   the us congress passed the american jobs creation act of act 
the act includes two primary provisions  relating to a tax deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities and a temporary incentive for us multinational companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings  which could impact us in fiscal and future years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the domestic manufacturing benefit on our consolidated tax accrual or effective tax rate for fiscal currently  we have no plans to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings pursuant to the guidelines outlined in the act 
however  since the temporary incentive is provided for a period of one year we will continue to reassess the potential for modifying our plan through the end of fiscal comparison of fiscal and fiscal consolidated summary net income for fiscal increased to million per diluted share from million per diluted share in fiscal the increase in net income was primarily the result of strong operating results in asia pacific and lower interest costs from reduced debt levels 
although consolidated net sales increased over fiscal  the majority of this increase could be attributed to currency changes and acquisitions 
excluding these items  the year over year sales growth was 
overall operating income decreased in fiscal europe continued to feel the effects of depressed economic conditions and competitive pressures and incurred an operating loss for the year 
north america s operating income was negatively impacted by currency changes between the canadian and us dollar 
in addition  selling and administrative costs increased over fiscal levels 
north america year ended january change change in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative amortization recovery of note receivable environmental expenses operating income net sales in north america increased million or in fiscal to million 
the change in foreign currency rates between the us and canadian dollar accounted for million of the fiscal sales increase 
the remaining million or increase was due to an increased volume of shipments from north american facilities 
north american lift truck industry shipments from to increased 
during  industry shipments were at depressed levels in comparison with historical shipments 
we believed the shipment levels were more representative of normal business levels for the industry 
although the growth in lift truck shipments exceeded our net sales growth  we believed  we had maintained or slightly increased our existing market share in north america during fiscal north america s gross margin decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the sale in the united states of certain products manufactured in canada 
our sales of these products were in us dollars but a significant portion of the costs were in canadian dollars 
during  the value of the us dollar against the canadian dollar decreased 
the effect of this change reduced the overall gross margins 
selling and administrative costs for fiscal in north america increased or million over fiscal excluding the effects of currency changes  these costs increased or million  driven primarily by  of costs related to complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act   of postretirement health care costs and million of research and development costs  offset by various cost reductions 
during fiscal  cascade and the boeing company entered into a settlement agreement with the city of portland  oregon city regarding litigation brought by the city in alleging damages arising from the proximity of the groundwater contamination in the area of the respective plants to a city water well field 
our share of the million settlement was million 
we had recorded a million charge related to the settlement in fiscal and recorded additional environmental expenses of million during fiscal the full settlement was paid in fiscal we recorded million of income in fiscal related to a settlement reached between cascade and maine rubber related to outstanding principal and interest due under the note receivable described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the million payment was payment in full for the release of any remaining liability of maine rubber under the note receivable 
we had recorded a million allowance against the note balance in fiscal due to financial difficulties experienced by maine rubber 
europe year ended january change change in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative amortization operating income loss europe s fiscal net sales increased or million in comparison with fiscal changes in foreign currency rates  related primarily to the euro  accounted for just over or million of the increase 
acquisitions in germany and italy during fiscal added million to fiscal sales or of the increase 
the remaining fiscal sales increase of million  or of fiscal sales  was due to increases in product shipments 
overall industry shipment levels in europe in fiscal were consistent with levels 
we believed we had increased our existing market share in europe 
gross margins in europe were for fiscal  down slightly from the fiscal gross margin of 
this decrease was due primarily to lower sales prices on certain products in europe 
selling and administrative costs for fiscal in europe increased or million over fiscal the primary reason for the increase was the effect of currency changes  which accounted for million or of the increase 
acquisitions added million of selling and administrative costs 
excluding currency changes and costs related to acquired companies  selling and administrative costs were consistent with fiscal our european operations had continued to experience declining financial results and incurred an operating loss of  in fiscal in comparison with operating income of  in fiscal additional costs related to the acquisitions were the most significant factor contributing to the fiscal operating loss 
asia pacific year ended january change change in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative amortization operating income asia pacific net sales grew by or million in fiscal over fiscal excluding currency changes  net sales increased or million 
a significant portion of the increase excluding currency changes relates to sales in china 
overall sales in china grew in fiscal  but still only account for of our consolidated net sales 
substantially all of our products manufactured in china are currently sold within that country 
gross margins in the asia pacific region increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was due primarily to higher shipment volumes in china 
in addition  gross margins in australia had increased steadily over the past year as we benefit from the restructuring activities  which occurred in prior years 
selling and administrative costs in asia pacific for fiscal increased over fiscal excluding the effect of foreign currencies  selling and administrative expenses decreased from fiscal we had been able to reduce overall spending levels despite the increased sales activity in the region 
non operating items interest expense in fiscal decreased in comparison with fiscal the decrease was due to our efforts to reduce our overall debt levels 
see financial condition and liquidity for additional discussion of our debt levels and payments 
consolidated interest income decreased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the receipt of payment in full of notes receivable related to the sale of our hydraulic cylinder division 
our effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to in comparison to in fiscal this decrease was due to higher levels of pre tax income in lower tax rate jurisdictions of foreign entities  as well as our ability to utilize research and development credits 
these benefits were reduced by our recording of a valuation allowance against certain foreign subsidiary net operating losses 
cash flows the statements of cash flows reflect the changes in cash and cash equivalents for the three years ended january  by classifying transactions into three major categories of activities operating  investing and financing 
operating our main source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities 
this consists of net income adjusted for noncash operating items such as depreciation and amortization  losses on disposition of assets  deferred income taxes  as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to higher levels of net income  depreciation and amortization and accounts payable 
these improvements were offset by increases in other operating assets  primarily accounts receivable and inventory 
our net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to higher levels of net income and depreciation and amortization and a reduction in the income taxes receivable 
these improvements were offset with changes in other operating accounts  primarily accounts receivable and inventory 
fiscal net cash from operating activities was increased by the recovery of a portion of a note receivable previously written off 
investing the principal recurring investing activities are capital expenditures 
these expenditures are primarily for equipment and tooling related to product improvements  more efficient production methods and replacement for normal wear and tear 
capital expenditures were million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe the level of capital expenditures is sufficient to maintain required operational requirements 
we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to approximate depreciation expense and fiscal capital expense 
we held marketable securities of million and million at january  and  respectively 
these securities consisted of auction rate securities issued by various state agencies throughout the united states 
these securities are insured either through third party agencies or reinsured through the federal government 
the securities are long term instruments maturing through  however  the interest rates and maturities are reset approximately every month  at which time we can sell the securities 
accordingly  we have classified the securities as short term in the consolidated balance sheets 
interest rates on the securities ranged from to  per annum 
on october   we completed the acquisition of the assets of falkenroth foerdertechnik  gmbh in schalksmuhle  germany 
the aggregate purchase price paid in cash for falkenroth  net of assumed liabilities  was million 
on march   we completed the acquisition of fema forks gmbh fema  a supplier of forks based in hagen  germany 
the aggregate purchase price paid in cash for fema  net of assumed liabilities  was million 
on october   we acquired roncari srl  an italian supplier of material handling equipment 
the aggregate purchase price paid in cash for roncari  net of assumed liabilities  was million 
proceeds from the sale of securities received as a reversion from a pension plan terminated in were million during fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold our hydraulic cylinder division to precision hydraulic cylinders  inc precision for approximately million 
as partial consideration we received a million note receivable 
in addition  under the terms of sale  we made interim operating capital advances to precision of million in fiscal these advances were repaid to us by january  during fiscal  we received million from precision as payment in full of all amounts due from the sale of the hydraulic cylinder division 
the remaining proceeds from notes receivable in fiscal related to the million settlement of the maine rubber note receivable 
financing we continued with our planned reduction of debt balances in each of the three years ended january  as of january   we had made all scheduled debt payments 
any additional payments to prepay scheduled amounts are subject to penalties 
we are continually evaluating our option to make additional debt payments and incur the penalties in light of our current cash position 
we repurchased million of common stock in fiscal there were no repurchases during fiscal and fiscal we declared dividends of  
and per share in fiscal   and  respectively 
the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options generated million and million of cash in fiscal and  respectively 
financial condition and liquidity working capital at january  was million as compared to million of working capital at january  our current ratio at january  was to in comparison to to at january  total outstanding debt  including notes payable to banks  at january  was million in comparison with million at january  our debt to equity ratio improved to 
to at january  from 
to at january  our debt agreements contain covenants relating to net worth and leverage ratios 
we are in compliance with debt covenants at january  borrowing arrangements currently in place with commercial banks provide committed lines of credit totaling million  of which million were being used through the issuance of letters of credit at january  average interest rates on notes payable to banks were at january  and at january  we believe our cash and cash equivalents  existing credit facilities and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our expected working capital  capital expenditure and debt retirement requirements for fiscal other matters during fiscal and  the holder of our exchangeable preferred stock exchanged  of those shares for the same amount in common stock 
these non cash transactions resulted in a reclassification of million in fiscal and million in from exchangeable preferred stock into common stock and additional paid in capital and had no effect on earnings per share as presented in the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
no exchangeable preferred stock remained outstanding at january  we maintain defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom  canada and france and a postretirement health care plan in the united states covering certain employees 
we calculate the net periodic pension costs related to our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans on an annual basis 
due to changes in assumptions in the discount rate and health care cost trend rates to reflect market conditions and actual rates of return on plan assets  our pension costs have increased in recent years 
this trend of increasing pension costs may continue in future years 
however  we are also investigating various options with these plans to mitigate future cost increases 
the us dollar weakened in fiscal in comparison to most foreign currencies used by our significant foreign operations 
as a result  foreign currency translation adjustments increased shareholders equity by million in fiscal in fiscal and  the foreign currency translation adjustments increased shareholders equity by million and million  respectively 
we are currently engaged in ongoing environmental remediation efforts at both of our fairview  oregon and springfield  ohio manufacturing facilities 
current estimates provide for some level of remediation activities in fairview through and springfield through costs of certain remediation activities at the fairview facility are shared with the boeing company  with cascade paying of actual remediation costs 
liabilities for the ongoing remediation efforts at our fairview and springfield facilities and certain environmental litigation are million and million at january  and  respectively 
the accrued environmental expenses recorded as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet at january  represent our estimated cash expenditure for ongoing remediation activities for the fiscal year ending january  we sold our hydraulic cylinder division to precision hydraulic cylinders  inc precision on january  under the terms of the sale  we assigned to precision an operating lease related to a manufacturing facility in beulaville  north carolina 
we are the guarantor on the lease in the event precision fails to comply with the lease terms 
the lease requires payments by precision of approximately  per month through november the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of january  payment due by period total less than year years years greater than years in thousands notes payable to banks long term debt  including capital leases operating leases total off balance sheet arrangements at january  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  fasb staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of was issued 
fsp permitted the deferral of recognizing the effects of the act in the accounting for post retirement health care plans under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefactors other than pensions  and in providing disclosure related to the plans required by sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
we elected the deferral provided by this fsp 
in may  the fasb issued staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp no 
discusses further the effect of the act and supersedes fsp this act introduces a federal subsidy to employers whose prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to the new medicare part d 
we believe our postretirement benefit plan is actuarially equivalent to part d 
fsp considers the effect of the two new features introduced in the act in determining our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo and net periodic post retirement benefit cost 
the effect on the apbo will be accounted for as an actuarial experience gain to be amortized into income over the average remaining service period of plan participants 
as permitted by fsp  we have elected to account for the impact of this benefit prospectively beginning in the third quarter of the year ended january  the adoption of fsp reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at june   the date of adoption  from million to million 
this reduction relates to benefits attributed to past service 
our estimated annual net periodic benefit cost after the adoption of fsp was reduced by  to million 
the  reduction in annual cost includes   and  in service cost  interest cost and amortization of recognized actuarial losses  respectively 
the impact on the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended january  was a  reduction in the cost 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb no 
 chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and re handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas shall be applied prospectively and are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date this statement was issued 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
on april   the securities and exchange commission amended the compliance date for sfas r until the first quarter of fiscal sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments will no longer be an alternative 
sfas r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after july  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas we are currently evaluating sfas r  including the method of adoption  and expect it will result in modifications to our current accounting for both stock options and sars 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends apb no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations 
a significant portion of our net sales are denominated in currencies from international markets outside the united states 
as a result  our operating results could become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
the table below illustrates the hypothetical increase in fiscal net sales of a weaker us dollar against foreign currencies which impact our operations in millions euro canadian dollar british pound other currencies representing net sales less than of consolidated net sales we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
the principal currencies hedged are denominated in japanese yen  canadian dollars  euros and british pounds 
our foreign currency forward exchange contracts have terms lasting up to six months  but generally less than one month 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements item 
a majority of our products are manufactured using steel as a primary raw material and steel based components as purchased parts 
as such  our cost of goods sold is sensitive to fluctuations in steel prices  either directly through the purchase of steel as raw material or indirectly through the purchase of steel based components 
presuming that the full impact of commodity steel price increases is reflected in all steel and steel based component purchases  we estimate our gross margin percentage would decrease by approximately for each increase in commodity steel prices 
based on our statement of income for the year ended january   a increase in commodity steel prices would have decreased consolidated gross profit by approximately million 
during fiscal  we experienced significant increases in prices for steel and steel components 
we moved aggressively to offset these increases through a variety of means  including sales price increases  surcharges and alternative sourcing arrangements 
we were more successful in north america and asia pacific in realizing the full benefits of these mitigating measures 
in europe the measures were not as successful  resulting in some erosion of gross margins for certain products 
during fiscal we are expecting some additional steel price increases and will continue to implement mitigating measures where needed 
substantially all of our debt at january  has a fixed interest rate 
any additional payments to prepay scheduled amounts of debt are subject to penalties 
at january   the penalties to retire all of our long term debt were million 
a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates by would decrease the fair value of our long term debt outstanding at january  by
