the company has  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses to the extent they believe certain claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
factors considered by management in estimating the company s liability are the loss and damages sought by the claimant plaintiff  the merits of the claim  the amount of loss in the client s account  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of the employee of the company  the total cost of defending the litigation  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for fines and penalties from regulatory agencies 
results of litigation and arbitration are inherently uncertain  and management s assessment of risk associated therewith is subject to change as the proceedings evolve

tax contingencies are liabilities that might arise from a successful challenge by the state taxing authorities taking a contrary position or interpretation regarding the application of tax law to the company s tax return filings
