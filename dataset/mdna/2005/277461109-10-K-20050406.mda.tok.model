item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most complex management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue and expense amounts 
revenue recognition kodak recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
for the sale of multiple element arrangements whereby equipment is combined with services  including maintenance and training  and other elements  including software and products  the company allocates to  and recognizes revenue from  the various elements based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value if software is not included or is incidental to the transaction or kodak specific objective evidence of fair value if software is included and is other than incidental to the sales transaction as a whole 
for full service solutions sales  which consist of the sale of equipment and software which may or may not require significant production  modification or customization  there are two acceptable methods of accounting percentage of completion accounting and completed contract accounting 
for certain of the company s full service solutions  the completed contract method of accounting is being followed by the company 
this is due to insufficient historical experience resulting in the inability to provide reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to the various stages of such contracts as would be necessary under the percentage of completion methodology 
when the company does have sufficient historical experience and the ability to provide reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and the costs applicable to the various stages of these contracts  the company will account for these full service solutions under the percentage of completion methodology 
at the time revenue is recognized  the company also records reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given from a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
such incentive programs include cash and volume discounts  price protection  promotional  cooperative and other advertising allowances  and coupons 
for those incentives that require the estimation of sales volumes or redemption rates  such as for volume rebates or coupons  the company uses historical experience and internal and customer data to estimate the sales incentive at the time revenue is recognized 
in the event that the actual results of these items differ from the estimates  adjustments to the sales incentive accruals would be recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records and maintains a provision for doubtful accounts for customers based on a variety of factors including the company s historical experience  the length of time the receivable has been outstanding and the financial condition of the customer 
in addition  kodak regularly analyzes its customer accounts and  when it becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s overall financial condition  records a specific provision for uncollectible accounts to increase the allowance to the amount that is estimated to be uncollectible 
if circumstances related to specific customers were to change  the company s estimates with respect to the collectibility of the related receivables could be further adjusted 
however  losses in the aggregate have not exceeded management s expectations 
page inventories kodak reduces the carrying value of its inventory based on estimates of what is excess  slow moving and obsolete  as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these write downs are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if  in the future  the company determined that market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected and  therefore  inventory was overvalued  the company would be required to further reduce the carrying value of the inventory and record a charge to earnings at the time such determination was made 
if  in the future  the company determined that inventory write downs were overstated and  therefore  inventory was undervalued  the company would recognize the increase to earnings through higher gross profit at the time the related undervalued inventory was sold 
however  actual results have not differed materially from management s estimates 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  by first grouping its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group and  secondly  estimating the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise from the use of and eventual disposition of such asset group 
the company estimates the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group 
if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the company records an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the company determines fair value through quoted market prices in active markets or  if quoted market prices are unavailable  through the performance of internal analyses of discounted cash flows or external appraisals 
the undiscounted and discounted cash flow analyses are based on a number of estimates and assumptions  including the expected period over which the asset will be utilized  projected future operating results of the asset group  discount rate and long term growth rate 
to assess goodwill for impairment  the company performs an assessment of the carrying value of its reporting units on an annual basis or when events and changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company s reporting units below their carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company would record an impairment charge to earnings to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units through internal analyses and external valuations  which utilize income and market valuation approaches through the application of capitalized earnings  discounted cash flow and market comparable methods 
these valuation techniques are based on a number of estimates and assumptions  including the projected future operating results of the reporting unit  discount rate  long term growth rate and appropriate market comparables 
the company s assessments of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets  and its periodic review of the remaining useful lives of its long lived assets are an integral part of the company s ongoing strategic review of the business and operations  and are also performed in conjunction with the company s periodic restructuring actions 
therefore  future changes in the company s strategy  the ongoing digital substitution  the continuing shift from overnight photofinishing to onsite processing and other changes in the operations of the company could impact the projected future operating results that are inherent in the company s estimates of fair value  resulting in impairments in the future 
additionally  other changes in the estimates and assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term growth rate  which drive the valuation techniques employed to estimate the fair value of long lived assets and goodwill could change and  therefore  impact the assessments of impairment in the future 
in performing the annual assessment of goodwill for impairment  the company determined that no material reporting units carrying values were close to exceeding their respective fair values 
see goodwill under note  significant accounting policies 
page investments in equity securities kodak holds minority interests in certain publicly traded and privately held companies having operations or technology within its strategic areas of focus 
the company s policy is to record an impairment charge on these investments when they experience declines in value that are considered to be other than temporary 
poor operating results of the investees or adverse changes in market conditions in the future may cause losses or an inability of the company to recover its carrying value in these underlying investments 
as of december   the amount related to the above investments recorded in the company s consolidated statement of financial position was million 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
at december   the company has deferred tax assets for its net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  relating to which the company has a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the company has considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the company operates  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for these valuation allowances 
if kodak were to determine that it would not be able to realize a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if the company were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which there is currently a valuation allowance would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
the company s effective tax rate considers the impact of undistributed earnings of subsidiary companies outside of the us deferred taxes have not been provided for the potential remittance of such undistributed earnings  as it is the company s policy to permanently reinvest its retained earnings 
however  from time to time and to the extent that the company can repatriate overseas earnings on essentially a tax free basis  the company s foreign subsidiaries will pay dividends to the us material changes in the company s working capital and long term investment requirements could impact the decisions made by management with respect to the level and source of future remittances and  as a result  the company s effective tax rate 
see note  income taxes 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the company 
conversely  if these issues are resolved favorably in the future  the related provisions would be reduced  thus having a positive impact on earnings 
warranty obligations management estimates expected product failure rates  material usage and service costs in the development of its warranty obligations 
at the time revenue is recognized  the company provides for the estimated costs of its warranties as a reduction of revenue 
actual results have not differed materially from management s estimates 
in the event that the actual results of these items differ from the estimates  an adjustment to the warranty obligation would be recorded 
page pension and postretirement benefits kodak s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions  which are reviewed annually by the company  include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
the company bases the discount rate assumption for its significant plans on the estimated rate at which annuity contracts could be purchased to discharge the pension benefit obligation 
in estimating that rate  the company looks to the aa rated corporate long term bond yield rate in the respective country as of the last day of the year in the company s reporting period as a guide 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a combination of formal asset and liability studies  historical results of the portfolio  and management s expectation as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on the company s long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of the likely long term trends 
the company reviews its expected long term rate of return on plan asset eroa assumption annually for the kodak retirement income plan krip 
to facilitate this review  every three years  or when market conditions change materially  the company undertakes a new asset and liability study to reaffirm the current asset allocation and the related eroa assumption 
the company s investment consulting firm completed a study the study in september  which led to several asset allocation shifts and a decrease in the eroa from for the year ended december  to for the years ended december  and in march  a new asset and liability modeling study has been completed and the eroa for will remain at 
given the decrease in the discount rate of basis points from for to for and increased recognition of unrecognized losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  total pension income from continuing operations for the major funded and unfunded defined benefit plans in the us is expected to decrease from million in to reflect an expense of million in pension expense from continuing operations in the company s non us plans is projected to increase from million in to million in additionally  due in part to the decrease in the discount rate from for to for and increased amortization expense relating to the unrecognized actuarial loss  the company expects the cost of its most significant postretirement benefit plan  the us plan  to approximate million in  as compared with million and million for and  respectively 
these estimates have been incorporated into the company s earnings outlook for actual results that differ from our assumptions are recorded as unrecognized gains and losses and are amortized to earnings over the estimated future service period of the plan participants to the extent such total net recognized gains and losses exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligation or the market related value of assets 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in future assumptions would affect the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations 
in accordance with the guidance under sfas no 
 the company is required to record an additional minimum pension liability in its consolidated statement of financial position that is at least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation of its defined benefit pension plans 
during  due to the performance of the global equity markets  combined with decreasing discount rates in  the company increased its additional minimum pension liability for its major defined benefit plans by million and recorded a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive income a component of shareholders equity of million  net of taxes of million 
if the global equity markets performance improves and discount rates stabilize or improve in future periods  the company may be in a position to reduce its additional minimum pension liability and reverse the corresponding charges to shareholders equity 
conversely  if the global equity markets performance and discount rates continue to decline in future periods  the company may be required to increase its additional minimum pension liability and record additional charges to shareholders equity 
to mitigate the increase in its additional minimum pension liability and additional charges to shareholders equity  the company may elect to fund a particular plan or plans on a case by case basis 
page environmental commitments environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures 
the liabilities include accruals for sites owned by kodak  sites formerly owned by kodak  and other third party sites where kodak was designated as a potentially responsible party prp 
the amounts accrued for such sites are based on these estimates  which are determined using the astm standard e  standard guide for estimating monetary costs and liabilities for environmental matters 
the overall method includes the use of a probabilistic model that forecasts a range of cost estimates for the remediation required at individual sites 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for remediation and long term monitoring of the sites 
such estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of remediation 
kodak s estimate of its environmental liabilities may also change if the proposals to regulatory agencies for desired methods and outcomes of remediation are viewed as not acceptable  or additional exposures are identified 
the company has an ongoing monitoring and identification process to assess how activities  with respect to the known exposures  are progressing against the accrued cost estimates  as well as to identify other potential remediation sites that are presently unknown

at december   estimated future investigation and remediation costs of million are accrued for this site and are included in the million reported in other long term liabilities 
the company announced the closing of three manufacturing facilities outside the united states in the company has obligations with estimated future investigation  remediation and monitoring costs of million at two of these facilities 
at december   these costs are accrued and included in the million reported in other long term liabilities 
the company has obligations relating to other operating sites and former operations with estimated future investigation  remediation and monitoring costs of million 
at december   these costs are accrued and included in the million reported in other long term liabilities 
the company has retained certain obligations for environmental remediation and superfund matters related to certain sites associated with the non imaging health businesses sold in at december   estimated future remediation costs of million are accrued for these sites and are included in the million reported in other long term liabilities 
cash expenditures for the aforementioned investigation  remediation and monitoring activities are expected to be incurred over the next thirty years for many of the sites 
for these known environmental exposures  the accrual reflects the company s best estimate of the amount it will incur under the agreed upon or proposed work plans 
the company s cost estimates were determined using the astm standard e  standard guide for estimating monetary costs and liabilities for environmental matters  and have not been reduced by possible recoveries from third parties 
the overall method includes the use of a probabilistic model which forecasts a range of cost estimates for the remediation required at individual sites 
the projects are closely monitored and the models are reviewed as significant events occur or at least once per year 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for remediation and long term monitoring of the sites 
the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that the losses for the known exposures could exceed the current accruals by material amounts 
a consent decree was signed in in settlement of a civil complaint brought by the us environmental protection agency and the us department of justice 
in connection with the consent decree  the company is subject to a compliance schedule  under which the company has improved its waste characterization procedures  upgraded one of its incinerators  and is evaluating and upgrading its industrial sewer system 
the total expenditures required to complete this program are currently estimated to be approximately million over the next five years 
these expenditures are incurred as part of plant operations and  therefore  are not included in the environmental accrual at december  the company is presently designated as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended the superfund law  or under similar state laws  for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of the company s alleged arrangements for disposal of hazardous substances at five such active sites 
with respect to each of these sites  the company s liability is minimal 
in addition  the company has been identified as a prp in connection with the non imaging health businesses in four active superfund sites 
numerous other prps have also been designated at these sites 
although the law imposes joint and several liability on prps  the company s historical experience demonstrates that these costs are shared with other prps 
settlements and costs paid by the company in superfund matters to date have not been material 
future costs are also not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the clean air act amendments were enacted in expenditures to comply with the clean air act implementing regulations issued to date have not been material and have been primarily capital in nature 
in addition  future expenditures for existing regulations  which are primarily capital in nature  are not expected to be material 
many of the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to this act have not been issued 
page uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
a finite estimate of cost does not normally become fixed and determinable at a specific time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability  and the company continually updates its cost estimates 
the company has an ongoing monitoring and identification process to assess how the activities  with respect to the known exposures  are progressing against the accrued cost estimates  as well as to identify other potential remediation sites that are presently unknown 
estimates of the amount and timing of future costs of environmental remediation requirements are necessarily imprecise because of the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of presently unknown remediation sites and the allocation of costs among the potentially responsible parties 
based upon information presently available  such future costs are not expected to have a material effect on the company s competitive or financial position 
however  such costs could be material to results of operations in a particular future quarter or year

if we do not effectively implement our new digitally oriented growth strategy  this could adversely affect our operations  revenue and ability to compete 
kodak is emphasizing digital technology and expanding into a range of commercial businesses in order to create a more balanced and diversified business portfolio while accelerating the implementation of its existing digital product strategies in the consumer markets 
kodak expects to incur restructuring charges in relation to these initiatives 
the expected benefits from these initiatives are subject to many estimates and assumptions  including assumptions regarding the amount and timing of cost savings and cash flow that kodak can achieve from its traditional consumer film and paper businesses  the speed at which consumer transition from traditional photography to digital photography occurs  kodak s ability to develop new digital businesses in its commercial  consumer and health markets  kodak s ability to identify  complete and integrate compatible strategic acquisitions consistent with its growth timeline  and the costs and timing of activities undertaken in connection with these initiatives 
in addition  these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic  competitive and other uncertainties that are beyond kodak s control 
if these assumptions are not realized  or if other unforeseen events occur  kodak s results of operations could be adversely affected  as it may not be able to grow its business  and its ability to compete could be negatively affected 
if we cannot manage our product and services transition or continue to develop and deploy new products and services  this could adversely affect our revenues 
unanticipated delays in implementing certain product strategies including digital products  category expansion and digitization could adversely affect kodak s revenues 
kodak s ability to successfully transition its existing products and develop and deploy new products requires that kodak make accurate predictions of the product development schedule as well as volumes  product mix  customer demand  sales channels  and configuration 
the process of developing new products and services is complex and often uncertain due to the frequent introduction of new products that offer improved performance and pricing 
kodak may anticipate demand and perceived market acceptance that differs from the product s realizable customer demand and revenue stream 
further  in the face of intense industry competition  any delay in the development  production or marketing of a new product could decrease any advantage kodak may have to be the first or among the first to market 
kodak s failure to carry out a product rollout in the time frame anticipated and in the quantities appropriate to customer demand  or at all  could adversely affect future demand for kodak s products and services and have an adverse effect on its business 
our revenue  earnings and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to enforce our licensing agreements and intellectual property rights 
kodak s ability to implement its intellectual property licensing strategies could also affect the company s revenue and earnings 
kodak has made substantial investments in technologies and needs to protect its intellectual property as well as the interests of other licensees 
the establishment and enforcement of licensing agreements provides a revenue stream in the form of royalties that protects kodak s ability to further innovate and help the marketplace grow 
kodak s failure to properly manage the development of its intellectual property could adversely affect the future of these patents and the market opportunities that could result from the use of this property 
kodak s failure to manage the costs associated with the pursuit of these licenses could adversely affect the profitability of these operations 
page our inability to develop and implement e commerce strategies that align with industry standards  could adversely affect our business 
in the event kodak were unable to develop and implement e commerce strategies that are in alignment with the trend toward industry standards and services  the company s business could be adversely affected 
the availability of software and standards related to e commerce strategies is of an emerging nature 
kodak s ability to successfully align with the industry standards and services and ensure timely solutions  requires the company to make accurate predictions of the future accepted standards and services 
system integration issues could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
kodak s completion of planned information systems upgrades  including sap  if delayed  could adversely affect its business 
as kodak continues to expand the planned information services  the company must continue to balance the investment of the planned deployment with the need to upgrade the vendor software 
kodak s failure to successfully upgrade to the vendor supported version could result in risks to system availability  which could adversely affect the business 
our inability to manage our acquisitions  divestitures and other portfolio actions could adversely impact our revenues and earnings 
kodak has recently completed various business acquisitions and intends to complete various other business acquisitions in the future  particularly in its health and graphic communications segments  in order to strengthen and diversify its portfolio of businesses 
at the same time  kodak needs to streamline and simplify its traditional businesses  including its photofinishing operations in the united states and eamer 
in the event that kodak fails to effectively manage the portfolio of its more traditional businesses while simultaneously integrating these acquisitions  it could fail to obtain the expected synergies and favorable impact of these acquisitions 
such a failure could cause kodak to lose market opportunities and experience a resulting adverse impact on its revenues and earnings 
in  kodak continues to focus on reduction of inventories  improvement in receivable performance  improvement in manufacturing productivity and the completion of focused capital expenditures 
if we do not timely implement our planned inventory reductions  this could adversely affect our cash flow 
unanticipated delays in the company s plans to continue inventory reductions in could adversely impact kodak s cash flow outlook 
planned inventory reductions could be compromised by slower sales that could result from accelerated digital replacement or continued weak global economic conditions 
purchasers uncertainty about traditional product demand or the extent of the global economic downturn could result in lower demand for products and services 
in addition  the competitive environment and the transition to digital products and services could also place pressures on kodak s sales and market share 
in the event kodak is unable to successfully manage these issues in a timely manner  they could adversely impact the planned inventory reductions 
delays in our plans to continue to improve our accounts receivable collections could adversely impact our cash flow 
unanticipated delays in the company s plans to continue the improvement of its accounts receivable collection could also adversely impact kodak s cash outlook 
a continued weak economy could slow customer payment patterns 
in addition  competitive pressures in major segments may cause the financial condition of certain of kodak s customers to deteriorate 
these same pressures may adversely affect the company s efforts to shorten customer payment terms 
kodak s ability to manage customer risk while maintaining a competitive market share may adversely affect continued accounts receivable improvement in page delays in our plans to improve manufacturing productivity and control cost of operations could negatively impact our gross margins 
delays in kodak s plans to improve manufacturing productivity and control costs of operations could negatively impact the gross margins of the company 
kodak s failure to successfully manage operational performance factors could delay or curtail planned improvements in manufacturing productivity 
accelerating digital substitution could result in lower volumes in the factory than planned  which would also negatively impact gross margins 
if kodak is unable to successfully negotiate raw material costs with its suppliers  or incurs adverse pricing on certain of its commodity based raw materials  reduction in the gross margins could occur 
additionally  delays in the company s execution of increasing manufacturing capabilities for certain of its products in some of its emerging markets  particularly china where it is more cost competitive  could adversely impact gross margins 
if we fail to execute our capital spending plan  this could adversely impact our cash flow 
if kodak exceeds its capital spending plan  this factor could adversely impact the company s cash flow outlook 
further  if kodak deems it necessary to spend more on regulatory requirements or if unanticipated general maintenance obligations arise that require more capital spending than planned  the increased spending could have an adverse impact on kodak s cash flow 
if our planned improvements in supply chain efficiency are delayed  this could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
kodak s planned improvement in supply chain efficiency  if delayed  could adversely affect its business by preventing shipments of certain products to be made in their desired quantities and in a timely manner 
the planned efficiencies could be compromised if kodak expands into new markets with new applications that are not fully understood or if the portfolio broadens beyond that anticipated when the plans were initiated 
the unforeseen changes in manufacturing capacity could also compromise the supply chain efficiencies 
the competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue  gross margins and market share 
competition remains intense in the imaging sector in the digital film imaging systems  graphic communications and health segments 
in the d fis segment  price competition has been driven somewhat by consumers conservative spending behaviors during times of a weak world economy  international tensions and the accompanying concern over war and terrorism 
in the health and graphic communications segments  aggressive pricing tactics intensified in the contract negotiations as competitors were vying for customers and market share domestically 
if the pricing and programs are not sufficiently competitive with those offered by kodak s current and future competitors  kodak may lose market share  adversely affecting its revenue and gross margins 
if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly  our revenue  gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted 
the impact of continuing customer consolidation and buying power could have an adverse impact on kodak s revenue  gross margins  and earnings 
in the competitive consumer retail environment  there is a movement from small individually owned retailers to larger and commonly known mass merchants 
in the commercial environment  there is a continuing consolidation of various group purchasing organizations 
the resellers and distributors may elect to use suppliers other than kodak 
kodak s challenge is to successfully negotiate contracts that provide the most favorable conditions to the company in the face of price and aggressive competitors
