table of contents fiscal year compared with fiscal year the following table sets forth statement of operations data in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated year ended year ended december  january  december  january  in thousands revenue costs  expenses and other income cost of product sales a research and development b selling  general and administrative b amortization of intangibles amortization of unearned compensation in process research and development impairment of long lived assets restructuring other loss gain on sale of certain operations operating income interest income  net gain loss on investments income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes benefit income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations income taxes from discontinued operations net income loss from discontinued operations net income note percentages may not add due to rounding 
a cost of product sales includes the following amortization of unearned compensation b amortization of unearned compensation is excluded from the following research and development selling  general and administrative revenue revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year grew to million from million during fiscal year this growth was primarily due to a increase in high end consumer products and a increase in communications products  which was partially offset by a decline of in our computing products 
in aggregate  higher unit demand increased sales by million  this was offset by a decline in average selling prices asps  which decreased sales by million 
geographically   and of product sales were derived from asia pacific  north america and europe  respectively  during fiscal year compared to  and during fiscal year we ship our products to a variety of countries in descending order by volume including the united states  china  taiwan  japan  germany  singapore  south korea  thailand and united kingdom as well as others with less volume 
the united states comprised approximately of the shipments  followed by china with  followed by taiwan with and japan with during fiscal year 
table of contents cost of product sales cost of product sales consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with product manufacturing  plus licensing and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 
in fiscal year  gross margin from continuing operations increased or million to million from million in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross margin from continuing operations was during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year a percentage point decline 
the decrease in gross margin was partially due to a decline in asps and also due to two hurricanes that impacted our operations in palm bay  florida 
these hurricane related costs consisted primarily of additional paid time off during the temporary closure of our palm bay facilities 
research and development r d r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and costs of employees engaged in product process research  design and development activities  as well as related subcontracting activities  prototype development  cost of design tools and technology license agreement expenses 
r d expenses from continuing operations increased to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year the increase in spending is primarily driven by an increase in labor expenses due to increased hiring and the acquisition of xicor 
selling  general and administrative sg a sg a costs  which include marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations was million during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase in spending is primarily due to an increase in labor expenses resulting from the acquisition of xicor 
as a percentage of sales  sg a costs decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this decrease is primarily due to an increase in sales 
amortization amortization of intangible assets from continuing operations increased to million during the fiscal year from million during fiscal year the increase is due to the addition of developed technology  resulting from the purchase of xicor and certain of the assets of bitblitz communications 
definite lived intangible assets are being amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years 
fas requires testing goodwill for impairment at least annually while checking for impairment indicators quarterly 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the value of each of our reporting units exceeded its book value 
therefore  no impairments were taken 
depending on the future market demand for our products  among other factors  we could experience an impairment of goodwill 
unearned compensation amortization of unearned compensation from continuing operations decreased slightly to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year the increase in unearned compensation due to the xicor acquisition was more than offset by the decrease in unearned compensation related to the elantec acquisition  as most of it has been amortized 
in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of xicor in july  we allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete projects 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the in process research and development had no alternative future uses and did not otherwise qualify for capitalization 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as a charge to income in fiscal year in valuing the in process research and development  our management used present value calculations of income  an analysis of project accomplishments and completion costs and an assessment of overall contribution and project risk 
the present value was determined by discounting to years of after tax cash flow projections depending on the individual project 
we used a discount 
table of contents rate of based on an approximation of the cost of capital 
the percentage of completion for the projects ranges from to  and the total cost to complete all projects at the time of the acquisition was approximately million 
the various project groupings  the cost to complete the projects and the average percentage complete within each grouping as of december  are reported below in millions project cost to complete percent complete value assigned to project digitally controlled potentiometers central processing unit real time clocks analog front end data acquisition intellectual property total although these estimates were developed with the assistance of an independent third party  management is primarily responsible for the valuation 
these estimates are subject to change given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
we expect to continue these development efforts and believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the projects  and there is no assurance that any will meet either technological or commercial success 
impairment of long lived assets during fiscal year  we recorded an impairment of long lived assets of million million net of tax 
this primarily consisted of a million million net of tax write down of certain definite lived intangible assets  which were tested for impairment following the sale of our wireless networking product group 
specifically  we impaired a portion of its customer base and developed technology balances that resulted from the purchase of the net assets of harris corporation s semiconductor business 
the impairments were measured as the excess of the assets carrying value over the assets fair value as determined by the present value of cash flows arising from the assets in accordance with sfas also included in the aforementioned million impairment was a million impairment million net of tax related to the write off of a prepaid royalty for which we were not going to incorporate the related technology into our products 
in accordance with sfas  the write off reduced the value of the prepaid royalty to zero as we did not expect to realize any future benefit from the asset 
on march   we announced that we would move all internal volume of our micron um wafer processing to ibm s burlington  vermont manufacturing facility 
we will focus our palm bay  florida manufacturing capacity on products  which are fabricated on greater than um proprietary processes 
due to this shift in manufacturing to an outside provider  we recorded an impairment of million million net of tax during the quarter ended april  on certain production equipment that was used to produce the um wafers at our palm bay facility 
the impairment was calculated as the excess of the assets carrying value over their fair value as determined by the market prices of these types of assets 
majority of these assets have either been sold or are being held for sale 
during fiscal year  we reversed million of the impairment on this equipment as the actual selling price of certain assets exceeded the impaired value by at least that amount 
also during fiscal year  we impaired million of prepaid deposits to vendors due to a change in a certain product s roadmap 
this long term prepaid asset was impaired completely as we had no future use for the asset 
the impairments described in this footnote pertain to continuing operations and are contained within the caption impairment of long lived assets on the face of the condensed consolidated statements of income 
other losses during fiscal year  hurricanes frances and jeanne damaged our palm bay  florida facilities 
we began restoration efforts during september and completed the majority of the work by the end of fiscal year we recorded million in losses related to the reconstruction costs incurred and for those contracted in order to fully restore the facilities to their original usefulness 
the remaining million contained in the other losses line resulted from the license agreement that the company entered into with ericsson see item 

table of contents gain on sale of certain operations on march   we sold the assets of our discrete power product group to fairchild semiconductor international  inc fairchild 
as a result of the sale we recorded an initial gain of million million net of tax during fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded an additional million million net of tax gain 
this gain was the result of a reduction of accrued exit costs due to favorable contract termination negotiations with software vendors 
similarly  in fiscal year  we recorded an additional million million net of tax gain related to the sale of our discrete power product group 
this gain was the result of a reduction of accrued exit costs due to favorable contract negotiations with landlords and other vendors 
interest income  net net interest income increased to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year this increase is due to longer maturities on our held to maturity investment balances and increases in short term interest rates during gain loss on investments during fiscal year  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to an investment  which is accounted for under the cost method of accounting since we hold less than ownership and can not exercise influence over the investee 
the impairment reflects the excess of the investment s carrying value over the estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from the eventual disposal of the securities 
the impairment was a result of a significant reorganization at the investee  which we believe  substantially eliminated their chances of making a profit in the future 
during fiscal year  we recognized a million gain million net of tax from the sale of all shares of globespanvirata common stock received as part of the sale  shares 
the gain was calculated as the net proceeds from the sale less the carrying value of the stock  which was determined as the fair market value during the five day period including the date of the transaction and the two days preceding and succeeding this date 
the globespanvirata common stock represented a portion of the consideration paid to us by globespanvirata in connection with the sale of our wireless networking product group 
during fiscal year  we recorded a gain of million million net of tax from the collection of previously escrowed funds resulting from the sale of our investment in powersmart  inc in june the entire escrow receipt was recorded as a gain as the investment had no carrying value 
during fiscal year  we had marketable securities that consisted of shares of stats chippac common stock that were classified as investments on the balance sheet 
they were recorded at fair value  which was determined based on quoted market prices 
as of january  we carried an unrealized gain on the investment of million  before taxes 
we held  shares  or approximately of total stats chippac shares outstanding  at january  during fiscal year  we sold all of our holdings in stats chippac for a realized gain of million 
proceeds from the sale were million 
tax expense the tax benefit for fiscal year of differs from the tax expense for fiscal year of due primarily to the tax benefit recorded in connection with the settlement of the and internal revenue service audits during the first quarter of in addition  an increase in our interest from tax exempt versus taxable investments  and the impact of the in process r d charge related to the xicor acquisition also contributed to the difference 
in determining net income  we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
in the ordinary course of business  there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize probable liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 

table of contents in addition to the risks to the effective tax rate described above  the effective tax rate reflected in forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in we have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision  however  we don t expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after congress or the treasury department provide additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language 
the range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and million 
the related potential range of income tax liability is between zero and million 
discontinued operations during fiscal year  we sold our wireless networking product group to globespanvirata  inc with the appropriate authority of the board of directors 
the wireless networking product group produced a portfolio of semiconductor solutions for the wireless local area network market wlan 
initial proceeds from the transaction included million in cash and million in globespanvirata common stock 
these shares represented approximately of the voting shares prior to the sale and approximately of the voting shares following the sale 
we sold all of the acquired globespanvirata shares in the same quarter in which we received them 
additionally  we retained the product group s accounts receivable and accounts payable balances that existed at the time of sale 
we recorded a gain on the sale of this product group of million million net of tax during fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded a gain of million million net of tax primarily as a result of finalizing a contingent working capital adjustment with globespanvirata 
also  during fiscal year  we reached a settlement with agere systems corporation agere on all pending litigations between the two companies under mutually agreeable terms 
as part of the confidential agreement  we recorded an expense of million million net of tax 
backlog our sales are made pursuant to purchase orders that are generally booked from one to six months in advance of delivery 
our standard terms and conditions of sale provide that these orders become non cancelable thirty days prior to scheduled delivery for standard products and ninety days prior to scheduled delivery for semi custom and custom products 
backlog is influenced by several factors  including market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times 
we had backlog at december  of million compared to million at january  although not always the case  backlog can be a leading indicator of performance for the next two quarters

table of contents revenue revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year increased to million from million during fiscal year increased demand for desktop and notebook power management  optical storage and dsl products increased revenue by million 
in addition  fiscal year contained a full year of elantec revenues and fiscal year contained approximately six months of such revenues 
this resulted in an additional million in revenue for fiscal year we also changed our revenue recognition for north american distribution in fiscal year  which caused revenues to be higher in fiscal year by million 
these increases were offset by a million decline in automotive related products as a result of our exit of that product group 
in total  average selling price declined  which caused a million decrease in revenue

in fiscal year  gross profit from continuing operations increased or million to million from million in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross margin from continuing operations was during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year  a percentage point improvement 
the primary driver of the increase  was growth in revenue  which increased gross profit by million 
in addition  the full year of elantec increased gross profit by million 
the closure of our findlay  ohio facility in mid  improved gross profit by approximately million 
we also changed our revenue recognition policy during fiscal year due to changes in our ability to estimate product returns 
since this change was not repeated in fiscal year  gross profit improved by million 
the exit of our lower margin automotive products group decreased gross profit by million

impairment of long lived assets during fiscal year  we recorded two impairments totaling million 
the first impairment of million million net of tax related to the property  plant and equipment within the findlay  ohio manufacturing facility 
the write down reduced the carrying value of the assets to their fair value  which was based on the contractual sales price of the assets in accordance with sfas prior to this impairment  the carrying value of the findlay assets was million

interest income expense interest income decreased to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year the decrease was due to a decrease in short term interest rates during fiscal years and this was partially offset by our investments in long term held to maturity investments 
interest expense also decreased to million from million for the same time periods 
gain loss on investments during fiscal year  we recorded a gain of million million net of tax from the sale of our investment in powersmart  inc the gain was calculated as the excess of the proceeds from disposition of the investment over its carrying value

business outlook the conditions external to the company appear to be improving 
we believe that the majority of the inventory adjustments in the supply channel have been concluded 
however  the high end consumer and computing markets generally experience relatively weak demand in the first quarter

net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million 
this was primarily due to income from continuing operations million excluding non cash charges such as impairments million  amortization of purchased intangibles million  amortization of unearned stock based compensation million  in process research and development charges million and depreciation of long lived assets million less million in cash used on components of working capital including accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid assets  and accounts payable 
net cash used by investing activities for fiscal year was million 
we spent million in cash net of cash received for the xicor acquisition during fiscal year during fiscal year we received a final payment of million for the settlement of the working capital adjustment related to the sale of our wireless networking product group 
this was offset by tax payments related to the gain on the sale as well as certain other transaction costs 
during the same time period  we received million in proceeds from the sale of our investment in chippac 
also during fiscal year  we spent million and million on the acquisition of certain assets of bitblitz communications and our cost method investments  respectively 
net cash used by financing activities during fiscal year was million resulting primarily from the purchase of treasury shares and the payment of dividends offset by the proceeds of exercised stock options 
we expect to continue this level of share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
we changed our per share dividend payout amount as indicated in the relevant section below 
we had a treasury stock repurchase program  which authorized us to repurchase up to million in our common stock  of which million had been used as of january  this repurchase plan was fully utilized by august in september  our board of directors authorized another stock repurchase program under which we could repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock  of which million had been used as of december  
table of contents we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  the estimated warranty obligation is affected by ongoing product failure rates and material usage costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates or material usage costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we warrant that our products will be free from defects in material workmanship and possess the electrical characteristics to which we have committed 
the warranty period is for one year following shipment 
we estimate our warranty reserves based on historical warranty experience 
we track returns by type and specifically identify those returns that were based on product failures and similar occurrences 
warranty reserves for the period ended december  and january  were million and million  respectively 
in certain instances when we sell product groups or assets  we may retain certain liabilities for known exposures and provide indemnification to the buyer with respect to future claims arising from events occurring prior to the sale date  including liabilities for taxes  legal matters  intellectual property infringement  environmental exposures and other obligations 
the terms of the indemnifications for tax are generally aligned to the applicable statute of limitations for the jurisdiction in which the divestiture occurred 
the terms for environmental indemnities typically do not expire 
all other indemnifications are from one to two years 
the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnifications are either contractually limited to a specified amount or unlimited 
we believe that the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnifications are not determinable at this time  as any future payments would be dependent on the type and extent of the related claims  and all available defenses  which are not estimable 
we generally provide customers with a limited indemnification against intellectual property infringement claims related to our products 
we accrue for known indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated  and accrue for estimated incurred but unidentified issues based on historical activity 
the accrual and the related expense for known issues were not significant during the periods presented 
we have separately classified on the face of the balance sheet our current held to maturity investments  which consist of securities with maturities less than one year but greater than days 
these balances can be converted to cash upon request at a minimal discount 
we have reclassified prior period balance sheet and cash flow information to conform with the current classification 
working capital trade accounts receivable  less the allowance  were million at december  compared to million at january  our standard terms range from net to net days 
from time to time  management has made exceptions to these standard terms for various business and competitive reasons and extended the terms up to days 
during the year  we granted payment terms outside of their standard terms to customers on approximately million of shipments 
as of december   approximately million of these transactions had been collected and million were outstanding 
the company has a strong history of collecting payments after the extensions without having to make concessions and therefore recognizes revenue upon shipment in these situations 
inventories increased to million at december  from million at january   due to the acquisition of xicor 
our income taxes payable decreased by  from million at january  to million at december  primarily due to tax payments associated with the gain on the sale our wireless networking product group and the conclusion of our and irs audits 
litigation accruals decreased million from fiscal year to fiscal year this was primarily driven by the settlement of our lawsuit with agere systems inc certain reclassifications have been made to move million of certain sales reserves into the trade accounts receivable allowances within the january  balance sheet to conform to the current presentation 
this change was made to provide more useful information concerning the net realizable value of our trade receivables 
the reserves fluctuate from year to year based on items such as the level of inventory at distributors and customer returns as well as sales volume 
these reserves increased from million at january  to million at december  this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of xicor 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year in we had invested significantly in our foundry operations  for which we spent million during fiscal year additional capital expenditures during fiscal year included the expansion of our fabrication facility in palm bay  florida in order to accommodate the 
table of contents transfer of certain production processes from our findlay  ohio and milpitas  california facilities  as well as general manufacturing capacity increases of million  research and development capital of million and information technology equipment of million 
transactions with related and certain other parties as of january   we held a loan receivable within the other assets section in our balance sheet resulting from a loan made to one of our executives who is neither the cfo nor ceo 
the loan  which totaled million at january   was made by elantec prior to the merger as part of employment offers 
the loan was a recourse loan  and the security was in the form of a second trust deed on the employee s real property 
the loan earned interest in excess of the prime rate 
this loan was repaid in full on august  we currently have no outstanding loans with any officers or directors 
sterling  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of citigroup  inc  and its affiliates formerly owned a significant number of intersil s common shares 
however  as of december   sterling held none 
citigroup venture capital equity partners  which is managed by an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of citigroup  inc  indirectly owns an interest in stats chippac 
we have a contract in place with stats chippac  in which they provide a specified percentage of our test and package activities subject to certain exceptions 
the terms of the contract were the result of arms length negotiations and are no less favorable than those that could be obtained from non affiliated parties 
this contract expires june  at the time the contract was entered into  citigroup venture capital held a seat on intersil s board of directors and on the board of directors of the predecessor to stats chippac 
we had million and million of trade accounts payable to stats chippac as of december  and january   respectively 
purchases under this contract during the year ended december  totaled million 
although we expect our relationship with stats chippac to continue after the expiration of this agreement  the services provided under this agreement are available from other vendors 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have included our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimates  in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimates  and the possible effects on our financial condition 
the five accounting estimation processes discussed below are the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory  distributor reserves  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and tax valuation allowances 
these estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on our operations and financial position 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables was million on gross trade receivables of million at december  the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables was million on gross trade receivables of million at january  this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables 
since the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding cannot be known until the future  we rely primarily on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have been typically infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being less than of sales 
in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but will have such an inability  we maintain an allowance based on a month rolling average of write offs  which as of december  equaled of our gross trade receivable balance 
we also maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons  such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify the accounts that are more likely to have collection problems 
we then reserve a portion or all of the customer s balance 
we record our inventories at the lower of standard cost or market as described in the footnotes to the financial statements 
as the ultimate market value that we will recoup through sales on our inventory can not be known with exact certainty as of the date of this filing  we rely on past sales experience and future sales forecasts 
in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify certain inventory as either excess or obsolete 
these classifications are maintained for all classes of inventory  although due to the commonality between our products  raw materials are seldom deemed excess or obsolete 
we classify inventory as obsolete if we have withdrawn it from the marketplace or if we have had no sales of the product for the past months and no sales forecasted 
table of contents for the next months 
we reserve of the standard cost of obsolete inventory 
it is our policy to scrap obsolete inventory 
reviews are conducted of excess inventory on a monthly basis 
we classify inventory as excess if we have quantities of product greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months 
we typically retain excess inventory until the inventory is sold or re classified as obsolete 
we reserve approximately to of the standard cost of the excess inventory 
we believe that to represents the portion we will not be able to recover when we attempt to sell this inventory due to our new product next generation introductions and other technological advancements 
for all items identified as excess or obsolete during the process described above  management reviews the individual facts and circumstances ie competitive landscape  industry economic conditions  product lifecycles and product cannibalization specific to that inventory 
included in the other allowances for trade receivables are reserves for eventual customer credits 
this is a combination of distributor  original electronic manufacturer oem and warranty reserves 
distributor reserves were million and million at december  and january   respectively 
revenue is recognized from sales to all other customers  excluding north american distributors  when a product is shipped 
sales to international distributors are made under agreements  which provide the distributors certain price protection on a percentage of unsold inventories they hold 
accordingly  distributor reserves are amounts within our trade receivable allowance section of the balance sheet that estimate the amount of price adjustments that will be encountered in the future on the inventory that is held by international distributors as of the balance sheet date 
as the amount of inventory held by international distributors that will be adjusted in the future cannot be known with certainty as of the date hereof  we rely primarily on historical international distributor transactions 
the international distributor reserves comprise two components that are reasonably estimable 
the first component of international distributor reserves is the price protection reserve  which protects the distributors gross margins in the event of falling prices 
this reserve is based on the relationship of historical credits issued to distributors in relation to historical inventory levels and the price paid by the distributor as applied to current inventory levels 
the second component is a stock rotation reserve  which is based on the percentage of sales made to limited international distributors whereby the distributors can periodically receive a credit for unsold inventory they hold 
actual price protection and stock rotation changes have historically been within management s expectations 
reserves for our oem customers totaled million and warranty reserves were million as of december  revenue is recognized from sales to all customers  except north american distributors  when a product is shipped 
sales to international distributors are made under agreements  which provide the international distributors price protection on and rights to periodically exchange a percentage of unsold inventory they hold 
accordingly  sales are reduced for estimated returns from international distributors and estimated future price reductions of unsold inventory held by international distributors 
we generally recognize sales to north american distributors upon shipment to the end customer 
however  the company began to place certain parts nearing or at the end of their lifecycle on non cancelable  non returnable terms ncnr during fiscal year and as a result revenue is recognized for these sales at the point of shipment to north american distributors 
pursuant to sfas  we completed an initial impairment review of our goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives as of december  and found no impairment 
according to our accounting policy  we also performed an annual review during the fourth quarter of each subsequent year  and in both reviews we found no impairment 
we will perform a similar review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
goodwill is tested under the two step method for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
our reporting units as of december  are the analog signal processing and power management product groups because they are each managed by a general manager and have discrete financial information 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  the purpose of which is to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  the purpose of which is to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be its new accounting basis 
we have not recognized any impairment losses on goodwill since adopting sfas as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  
table of contents we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
at december   our net deferred tax asset amounted to million compared to million at january  this increase is primarily due to deferred tax assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting of xicor associated with their net operating loss carryforwards nols 
a detailed analysis was performed related to our ability to utilize these nols and we have concluded  as discussed above  that these assets will likely be recovered from future taxable income 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 whether an investor should apply the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock 
eitf issue no 
addresses whether the equity method of accounting applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock of an investee but exercises significant influence through other means 
eitf issue no 
states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in substance common stock of a corporation  provided that the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
the accounting provisions of eitf issue no 
are effective for the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of eitf issue no 
to impact our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments 
additionally  eitf issue no 
includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf issue no 
 however  the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted for our year ended december  we will evaluate the effect  if any  of eitf issue no 
when final guidance is released 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued for employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the provisions of this statement are effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the provisions of this revision to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we plan to adopt this in our fiscal quarter ending july  it is  however  expected to have a negative effect on consolidated net income 
in december  the fasb decided to defer the issuance of their final standard on earnings per share eps entitled earnings per share an amendment to fas the final standard will be effective in and will require retrospective application for all prior periods presented 
the significant proposed changes to the eps computation are changes to the treasury stock method and contingent share guidance for computing year to date eps  removal of the ability to overcome the presumption of share settlement when computing diluted eps when there is a choice of share or cash settlement and inclusion of mandatorily convertible securities in basic eps 
we are currently evaluating the proposed provisions of this amendment to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we  in the normal course of doing business  are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments  entered into for purposes other than trading purposes  to manage our exposure to these risks 
at december   we had open foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of million  which was to hedge forecasted foreign cash flow commitments up to six months 
as hedges on forecasted foreign cash flow commitments do not qualify for deferral  gains and losses on changes in the fair market value of the foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income 
total net losses on foreign exchange contracts for the fiscal year were less than million 
during the fiscal year  we purchased and sold million of foreign exchange forward contracts 
the derivatives were also recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value  which was nominal  at december  the table below summarizes our foreign exchange contract activity over the past two years in millions fiscal year ended january  december  gain loss on foreign exchange contracts purchases and sales of foreign exchange contracts notional amount of open contracts at year end fair value of open contracts at year end our hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments 
a adverse change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held at december  will have a negligible impact on the fair values of these instruments 
this qualification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair values of foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments
