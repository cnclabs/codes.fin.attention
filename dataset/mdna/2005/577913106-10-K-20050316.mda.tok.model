table of contents forest products operations general the company engages in forest products operations through mgi  palco  britt and scotia llc 
palco  which has been in continuous operation for over years  engages in several principal aspects of the forest products industry the growing and harvesting of redwood and douglas fir timber  the milling of logs into lumber products and the manufacturing of lumber into a variety of value added finished products 
palco has over the past three years implemented a number of changes to allow it to operate on a more efficient and cost effective basis 
these changes include undertaking a mill improvement project that will include a new state of the art mill  installing a new planer facility  closing two of its sawmills  eliminating certain of its operations such as its company staffed logging operations  and utilizing more efficient harvesting methods 
see production facilities 
the company s forest products operations have been adversely affected by the failure of the california north coast regional water quality control board to release for harvest a number of palco s timber harvesting plans even though the plans have already been approved by the other government agencies which review palco s timber harvesting plans and are in compliance with palco s comprehensive multi species habitat conservation plan

timber and timberlands this section contains statements which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the pslra 
see this section and business general above for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
palco owns and manages  directly or through subsidiaries  approximately  acres of virtually contiguous commercial timberlands located in humboldt county along the northern california coast  an area which has very favorable soil and climate conditions for growing timber 
these timberlands  which are located in close proximity to palco s sawmills and have an extensive network of roads  contain predominantly conifer timber 
palco s conifers consist by volume of approximately redwood  douglas fir  and other conifer timber 
approximately  acres of palco s timberlands are owned by scotia llc the scotia llc timberlands  and scotia llc has the exclusive right to harvest the scotia llc timber rights approximately  acres of timberlands owned by palco and its subsidiary  salmon creek llc salmon creek 
the timber in respect of the scotia llc timberlands and the scotia llc timber rights is collectively referred to as the scotia llc timber 
the scotia llc timberlands and the timberlands of palco are collectively referred to as the palco timberlands 
substantially all of scotia llc s assets are pledged as security for its series b class a timber collateralized notes  series b class a timber collateralized notes and series b class a timber collateralized notes collectively  the timber notes 
the indenture governing the timber notes is referred to herein as the timber notes indenture 
under a master purchase agreement  palco harvests and purchases from scotia llc virtually all of the logs harvested from the scotia llc timber 
see relationships among the palco companies below for a description of this and other relationships among the palco companies 
in march  palco  scotia llc  and salmon creek collectively  the palco companies  consummated the headwaters agreement the headwaters agreement with the united states and california 
pursuant to the agreement  approximately  acres of timberlands owned by the palco companies the headwaters timberlands were transferred to the united states government in exchange for i an aggregate of million  ii approximately  acres of timberlands  and iii approval by the federal and state governments of habitat conservation and sustained yield plans the environmental plans in respect of substantially all of the palco timberlands 
california also agreed to offer to purchase other timberlands owned by palco and scotia llc which purchases were subsequently consummated 
timber generally is categorized by species and the age of a tree when it is harvested 
old growth trees are often defined as trees which have been growing for approximately years or longer and young growth trees are those which have been growing for less than years 
the forest products industry grades lumber into various classifications according to quality 
the two broad categories into which all grades fall based on the absence or presence of knots are called upper and common grades  respectively 
old growth trees have a higher percentage of upper grade lumber than young growth trees 

table of contents scotia llc s foresters  wildlife and fisheries biologists  geologists  botanists and other personnel provide a number of forest stewardship techniques  including protecting the timber located on the scotia llc timberlands from forest fires  erosion  insects and other damage  overseeing reforestation activities  and implementing and monitoring environmental and regulatory compliance 
scotia llc s personnel also prepare timber harvesting plans thps and maintain and update the information contained in the gis 
see harvesting practices below for a description of the gis updating process and the thp preparation process 
palco and scotia llc engage in extensive efforts to supplement the natural regeneration of timber and increase the amount of timber on its timberlands 
scotia llc and palco are required to comply with california forestry regulations regarding reforestation  which generally require that an area be reforested to specified standards within an established period of time 
pursuant to the services agreement described below see relationships among the palco companies  palco conducts regeneration activities on the scotia llc timberlands on behalf of scotia llc 
reforestation of redwood timber generally is accomplished through redwood sprouts from harvested trees and the planting of redwood seedlings at levels designed to optimize growth 
douglas fir timber is regenerated almost entirely by planting seedlings 
during  palco planted an estimated  redwood and douglas fir seedlings 
california law requires large timberland owners  including palco  to demonstrate that their timber operations will not decrease the sustainable productivity of their timberlands 
the applicable regulations require timber companies to project timber growth and harvest on their timberlands over a year planning period and to demonstrate sustained yield  ie that their projected average annual harvest for any decade within the year planning period will not exceed the average annual growth level at the end of the year planning period 
a timber company may comply with this requirement by submitting a sustained yield plan to the california department of forestry and fire protection cdf for review and approval 
timber companies which do not have a sustained yield plan are allowed to follow alternative procedures see below 
palco is also subject to federal and state laws providing for the protection and conservation of wildlife species which have been designated as endangered or threatened  certain of which are found on the palco timberlands 
these laws generally prohibit certain adverse impacts on such species referred to as a take  except for incidental take which does not jeopardize the continued existence of the affected species and is made in accordance with an approved habitat conservation plan and related incidental take permit 
a habitat conservation plan analyzes the impact of the incidental take and specifies measures to monitor  minimize and mitigate such impact 
as part of the headwaters agreement  the federal and state governments approved the environmental plans  which consisted of a sustained yield plan the syp and a multi species habitat conservation plan the hcp in respect of substantially all of the palco timberlands 
however  in connection with two lawsuits filed against palco  a california court invalidated the syp and the incidental take permits issued by california in connection with the environmental plans the california permits  a decision which palco has appealed 
see item  legal proceedings forest products litigation 
as a result of these cases  palco has since october been obtaining review and approval of its thps under the alternative procedure in the california forest practice rules known as option c 
option c is available to landowners who have submitted an option a plan to the cdf for review as was done by palco  and may be used during the review and approval period for the option a plan 
an approved option a plan is an alternative to obtaining approval of a sustained yield plan 
in december  palco revised and resubmitted its option a plan  which document the option a plan is currently under review by the cdf 
in may  palco completed its first timber cruise since the results of the timber cruise provided palco with an estimate of the volume of merchantable timber on the palco timberlands 
the cruise data reflected a million mbf decrease in estimated overall timber volume as compared to the estimated volumes reported as of december  using the cruise data adjusted for harvest and estimated growth 
the cruise data indicated that the palco timberlands have significantly less old growth timber than estimated as of december   using the cruise data 
there was also an estimated increase in young growth timber volume almost equal to the estimated decrease in old growth timber volume 
harvesting practices the ability of palco to harvest timber depends in large part upon the ability to obtain regulatory approval of thps prepared by scotia llc s foresters 
prior to harvesting timber in california  companies are obligated to obtain the 
table of contents cdf s approval of a detailed thp for the area to be harvested 
a thp must be submitted by a registered professional forester and is required to include information regarding the method of proposed timber operations for a specified area  whether the operations will have any adverse impact on the environment and  if so  the mitigation measures to be used to reduce any such impact 
the cdf s evaluation of thps incorporates review and analysis of such thps by several california and federal agencies and public comments received with respect to such thps 
the number of scotia llc s approved thps and the amount of timber covered by such thps varies significantly from time to time  depending upon the timing of agency review and other factors 
timber covered by an approved thp is typically harvested within a one year period from the date that harvesting first begins 
the timber notes indenture requires scotia llc to use its best efforts consistent with prudent business practices to maintain a number of pending thps which  together with thps previously approved  would cover rights to harvest a quantity of scotia llc timber adequate to pay interest and principal amortization based on the minimum principal amortization schedule as set forth in the timber notes indenture for the timber notes for the next succeeding twelve month period 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and investing and financing activities forest products operations regarding delays by the north coast water board in releasing already approved thps for harvest 
also see regulatory and environmental factors  item legal proceedings forest products litigation  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for various legal  regulatory  environmental and other challenges being faced by palco in connection with timber harvesting and other operations on its timberlands 
scotia llc maintains a detailed geographical information system covering the palco timberlands the gis 
the gis covers numerous aspects of these timber properties  including timber type  site productivity class  wildlife and botanical data  geological information  roads  rivers and streams 
pursuant to the services agreement defined below  palco  to the extent necessary  assists scotia llc in updating  upgrading and improving the gis and the other computer systems owned by scotia llc 
by carefully monitoring and updating this data base and conducting field studies  scotia llc s foresters are better able to develop detailed thps addressing the various regulatory requirements 
scotia llc also utilizes a global positioning system gps which can provide precise location of geographic features through satellite positioning 
use of the gps greatly enhances the quality and efficiency of the gis data 
scotia llc employs a variety of well accepted methods of selecting trees for harvest designed to achieve optimal growth and regeneration 
these methods  referred to as silvicultural systems in the forestry profession  range from very light thinnings aimed at enhancing the growth rate of retained trees to clear cutting  which results in the harvest of nearly all trees in an area with the exception of sub merchantable trees and trees retained for wildlife protection and future stand enhancement and replacement with a new forest stand 
in between are a number of varying levels of partial harvests which can be employed 
production facilities palco operates three highly mechanized sawmills and related facilities located in scotia  fortuna and arcata  california 
palco s sawmills historically have been supplied almost entirely from timber harvested from palco s timberlands  but are supplemented from time to time by logs purchased from third parties 
palco has over the years implemented numerous technological advances that have increased the operating efficiency of its production facilities and the recovery of finished products from its timber 
in april  palco commenced a mill improvement project  including a new state of the art sawmill located in scotia 
the new sawmill allows more efficient processing of smaller second growth logs up to in diameter and reduces operating and other costs 
the first phase of the project  the processing of smaller diameter logs  has been completed and production commenced in the third quarter of since commencing production  palco has made substantial progress in refining the production process 
as part of the mill improvement project  equipment from palco s carlotta mill is in the process of being moved to the new mill in scotia to be used to process larger diameter logs 
completion of this phase of the project is  however  subject to successful resolution of the liquidity problems being experienced by palco 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and investing and financing activities forest products operations 
the carlotta mill was permanently closed at the end of  and management is considering alternative uses for the property 
in addition  palco in january completed a new 
table of contents million planer project in scotia 
the new high speed state of the art system processes rough sawn boards into finished lumber up to four times faster than the older planers replaced by the new system 
britt s mill in arcata  california  primarily processes small diameter redwood logs into fencing products for sale to retail and wholesale customers 
britt purchases  primarily from palco but also from other timberland owners  small diameter to inch redwood logs of varying lengths 
britt processes these logs at its mill into a variety of fencing products  including dog eared by fence stock in six foot lengths  by fence posts in through foot lengths  and other lumber products in through foot lengths 
britt produced approximately  and million board feet of lumber in  and  respectively 
palco s remaining mill  located in fortuna  produces primarily common grade lumber 
subject to market conditions and lumber supply  palco dries a substantial portion of its lumber before it is processed or sold 
air or kiln dried lumber generally commands higher prices than green lumber  which is lumber sold before it has been dried 
drying also allows palco to compete in additional markets due to lower shipping costs resulting from the moisture and weight reduction which occurs in the drying process 
palco owns and can operate up to kilns having an annual capacity of approximately million board feet 
palco also operates a finishing and remanufacturing plant in scotia which processes rough lumber into a variety of finished products such as trim  fascia  siding and paneling 
remanufacturing enhances the value of some grades of lumber by assembling knot free pieces of narrower and shorter lumber into wider or longer pieces in palco s state of the art end and edge glue plant 
the result is a standard sized upper grade product which can be sold at a significant premium over common grade products 
palco owns and operates a cogeneration power plant which is fueled by the wood residue from logging and lumber production operations 
the operations of palco and britt supplied of the fuel in the power plant is capable of producing up to megawatts per hour and generates substantially all of the energy requirements of scotia  california  the town adjacent to the palco timberlands 
several of palco s facilities are located in scotia and a number of its employees live there 
palco sells surplus power to pacific gas and electric company 
in  the sale of surplus power accounted for approximately of mgi s total revenues 
products mgi produced  and million board feet of lumber in  and  respectively

table of contents information 
lumber products vary greatly by the species and quality of the timber from which they are produced 
lumber is sold not only by grade such as upper grade versus common grade  but also by board size and the drying process associated with the lumber 
redwood lumber has historically been mgi s largest product category 
redwood is commercially available only along the northern coast of california and possesses certain unique characteristics that permit it to be sold at a premium to many other wood products 
such characteristics include its natural beauty  superior ability to retain paint and other finishes  dimensional stability and innate resistance to decay  insects and chemicals 
typical applications include exterior siding  trim and fascia for both residential and commercial construction  outdoor furniture  decks  planters  retaining walls and other specialty applications 
redwood also has a variety of industrial applications because of its chemical resistance and because it does not impart any taste or odor to liquids or solids 
upper grade redwood lumber  which is derived primarily from larger diameter logs and is characterized by an absence of knots and other defects  little to no sapwood  and a tighter grain  is used primarily in distinctive interior and exterior applications 
common grade redwood lumber  historically mgi s largest volume product  has many of the same aesthetic and structural qualities of redwood uppers  but has some knots  sapwood and a coarser grain 
such lumber is commonly used for construction purposes  including outdoor structures such as decks and fencing 
douglas fir lumber is used primarily for new construction and some decorative purposes and is widely recognized for its strength  hard surface and attractive appearance 
douglas fir is grown commercially along the west coast of north america and in chile and new zealand 
upper grade douglas fir lumber is derived primarily from larger diameter douglas fir timber and is used principally in finished carpentry applications 
common grade douglas fir lumber is used for a variety of general construction purposes and is somewhat interchangeable with common grades of other whitewood species  although the strength of douglas fir makes it more desirable in certain applications 
mgi does not have any significant contractual relationships with third parties relating to the purchase of logs 
during  mgi purchased approximately million board feet of logs from third parties 
palco produces softwood chips from the wood residue from its milling operations 
these chips are sold to third parties for the production of wood pulp and paper products 
subject principally to economic feasibility  palco also produces and sells to third parties wood chips from hardwood trees 
backlog and seasonality mgi s backlog of sales orders at december  was million  of which it is estimated that million will be shipped in the first quarter of the sales backlog at december   was million  of which million was shipped in the first quarter of mgi has historically experienced lower first quarter sales due largely to the general decline in construction related activity during the winter months 
as a consequence  mgi s results in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year 
see also regulatory and environmental factors below and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and investing and financing activities forest products operations 
marketing the housing  construction and remodeling markets are the primary markets for mgi s lumber products 
mgi s goal is to maintain a wide distribution of its products geographically 
mgi s accounts are primarily wholesale  followed by industrial end users  manufacturers  retailers and exporters 
mgi s redwood and douglas fir lumber is sold throughout the entire united states  as well as to export markets 
common grades of redwood lumber are sold principally west of the mississippi river  with california accounting for approximately of common redwood sales in common grades of douglas fir lumber are sold primarily in california 
in  mgi s largest three customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of mgi s total net lumber sales 
exports of lumber accounted for approximately of mgi s total net lumber sales in mgi markets its products through its own sales staff which focuses primarily on domestic sales 
mgi actively follows trends in the housing  construction and remodeling markets in order to maintain an appropriate level of inventory and assortment of products 
due to its high quality products  strong brand recognition  competitive prices and long history  mgi believes it has a strong degree of customer loyalty 
however  this customer 
table of contents loyalty would be severely tested if product shortages result from the failure of the north coast water board to release for harvest already approved thps 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and investing and financing activities forest products operations 
competition mgi s lumber is sold in highly competitive markets 
competition is generally based upon a combination of price  service  product availability and product quality 
mgi s products compete not only with other wood products but with metals  masonry  plastic and other construction materials made from non renewable resources 
the level of demand for mgi s products is dependent on such broad factors as overall economic conditions  interest rates and demographic trends 
in addition  competitive considerations  such as total industry production and competitors pricing  as well as the price of other construction products  affect the sales prices for mgi s lumber products 
competition in the common grade redwood and douglas fir lumber market is intense  with mgi competing with numerous large and small lumber producers 
mgi primarily competes with the northern california mills of simpson  redwood empire  sierra pacific  canadian cedar lumber producers  as well as other imports and non wood alternatives 
employees as of march   mgi had approximately employees 
relationships among the palco companies the palco companies are parties to several agreements among themselves  including a master purchase agreement  a services agreement  an additional services agreement  a reciprocal rights agreement  and an environmental indemnification agreement 
palco and scotia llc are parties to a master purchase agreement the master purchase agreement which governs the sale to palco of logs harvested from the scotia llc timberlands 
as palco purchases logs from scotia llc pursuant to the master purchase agreement  palco is responsible  at its own expense  for harvesting and removing the standing scotia llc timber covered by approved thps  with the purchase price being based upon stumpage prices 
title to  and the obligation to pay for  harvested logs passes to palco once the logs are measured 
the master purchase agreement contemplates that all sales of logs by scotia llc to palco will be at fair market value based on stumpage prices for each species and category of timber 
the master purchase agreement provides that if the purchase price equals or exceeds the sbe price as defined below and a structuring price set forth in a schedule to the timber notes indenture  the purchase price is deemed to be at fair market value 
if the purchase price equals or exceeds the sbe price  but is less than the structuring price  then scotia llc is required to engage an independent forestry consultant to confirm that the purchase price reflects fair market value 
sbe price is the stumpage price for each species and category of timber as set forth in the most recent harvest value schedule or any successor publication published by the california state board of equalization or any successor agency applicable to the timber sold during the applicable period 
harvest value schedules are published twice a year for purposes of computing a yield tax imposed on timber harvested between january through june and july through december sbe prices are not necessarily representative of actual prices that would be realized from unrelated parties at subsequent dates 
scotia llc relies on palco  pursuant to a services agreement between the companies the services agreement  to provide operational  management and related services not performed by scotia llc s own employees with respect to the scotia llc timberlands 
these services include protecting the scotia llc timberlands from fire  disease and insects  maintaining and rehabilitating roads on the scotia llc timberlands  building new roads to permit the harvesting of scotia llc timber  providing certain timber management services  such as replanting and reforestation  designed to supplement the natural regeneration of  and increase the amount of  scotia llc timber  assisting scotia llc to comply with all applicable environmental laws  advising and consulting with scotia llc regarding legislative matters  preparing and filing on behalf of scotia llc at palco s cost all pleadings and motions  and otherwise diligently pursuing  appeals of any denial and defense of any challenge to approval of any thp or the environmental plans or similar plan or permit and related matters  and otherwise furnishing all equipment  personnel and expertise not within the scotia llc s possession and reasonably necessary for the operation and maintenance of the scotia llc timberlands and scotia llc timber 
palco is required to provide all services under the services agreement in a manner consistent in all material respects with prudent business practices which are consistent with then current applicable industry standards and are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable timber laws 
scotia llc pays palco a services fee which is 
table of contents adjusted annually based on a specified government price index relating to wood products and reimburses palco for the cost of constructing  rehabilitating and maintaining roads  and performing reforestation services  on the scotia llc timberlands 
certain of such reimbursable expenses vary in relation to the amount of timber to be harvested in any given period 
scotia llc provides certain services to palco pursuant to an additional services agreement between the companies 
these services include i assisting palco to operate  maintain and harvest its own timber properties  ii updating and providing access to the gis with respect to information concerning palco s own timber properties and iii assisting palco with its statutory and regulatory compliance 
this agreement provides that palco shall pay scotia llc a fee for such services equal to scotia llc s actual cost of providing such services  as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the palco companies are also parties to a reciprocal rights agreement whereby  among other things  the parties have granted to each other certain reciprocal rights of egress and ingress through their respective properties in connection with the operation and maintenance of such properties and their respective businesses 
in addition  palco and scotia llc are parties to an environmental indemnification agreement  pursuant to which palco has agreed to indemnify scotia llc from and against certain present and future liabilities arising with respect to hazardous materials  hazardous materials contamination or disposal sites  or under environmental laws with respect to the scotia llc timberlands 
in particular  palco is liable with respect to any contamination which occurred on the scotia llc timberlands prior to the date of their transfer to scotia llc 
regulatory and environmental factors this section contains statements which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the pslra 
see this section and business general above for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
general palco s business is subject to a variety of california and federal laws and regulations  as well as the hcp  dealing with timber harvesting practices  threatened and endangered species and habitat for such species  and air and water quality 
compliance with such laws and regulations also plays a significant role in palco s business 
the california forest practice act the forest practice act and related regulations adopted by the california board of forestry and fire protection the bof set forth detailed requirements for the conduct of timber harvesting operations in california 
these requirements include the obligation of timber companies to obtain regulatory approval of detailed thps containing information with respect to areas proposed to be harvested 
see harvesting practices above 
california law also requires large timberland owners  including palco  to demonstrate that their proposed timber operations constitute the maximum sustainable production of their timberlands over time 
see timber and timberlands above 
the federal endangered species act the esa and california endangered species act the cesa provide in general for the protection and conservation of specifically listed wildlife and plants 
these laws generally prohibit the take of certain species  except for specifically authorized incidental take pursuant to otherwise lawful activities which do not jeopardize the continued existence of the affected species and which are made in accordance with an approved habitat conservation plan and related incidental take permits 
a habitat conservation plan  among other things  specifies measures to minimize and mitigate the potential impact of the incidental take of species and to monitor the effects of the activities covered by the plan 
palco is also subject to the california environmental quality act the ceqa  which provides for protection of the state s air and water quality and wildlife  and the california porter cologne water quality control act and federal clean water act the cwa  which require that palco conduct its operations so as to reasonably protect the water quality of nearby rivers and streams 
compliance with such laws  regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations  together with other regulatory and environmental matters  have resulted in substantial restrictions on the scope and timing of palco s timber operations  increased operational costs significantly  and engendered continual litigation and other challenges to its operations 
moreover  the cash flows of palco and scotia llc have recently been adversely affected by the failure of the north coast water board to release for harvest thps which have already been approved by the other government agencies that approve scotia llc s thps 
see water quality below 

table of contents environmental plans the environmental plans  consisting of the hcp and the syp  which cover the substantial portion of the timberlands of the palco companies  were approved by the federal and state governments upon the consummation of the headwaters agreement 
in connection with approval of the environmental plans  incidental take permits the permits were issued with respect to certain threatened  endangered and other species found on the timberlands covered by the environmental plans 
the permits were to cover the year term of the hcp and allow incidental take of different species covered by the hcp  including nine species which are found on the palco timberlands that have been listed under the esa and or the cesa 
on october   the court hearing the epic syp permits lawsuit as defined below  entered a judgment invalidating the syp and the california permits  and that decision is now on appeal 
see item legal proceedings forest products litigation for further information regarding this matter 
the agreements which implement the environmental plans also provide for various remedies including the issuance of written stop orders and liquidated damages in the event of a breach by the palco companies of these agreements or the environmental plans 
under the hcp  harvesting activities are prohibited or restricted on certain areas of the palco timberlands 
some of these restrictions continue for the entire year term of the hcp 
for example  several areas consisting of substantial quantities of timber  including old growth redwood and douglas fir timber are designated as habitat conservation areas for the marbled murrelet  a coastal seabird  and certain other species 
harvesting in certain other areas of the palco timberlands is currently prohibited while these areas are evaluated for the potential risk of landslide 
further  additional areas alongside streams have been designated as buffers  in which harvesting is prohibited or restricted  to protect aquatic and riparian habitat 
restrictions on harvest in streamside buffers and potential landslide prone acres may be adjusted up or down  subject to certain minimum and maximum buffers  based upon the ongoing watershed analysis process described below 
the adaptive management process described below may also be used to modify most of these restrictions 
the first analysis of a watershed  freshwater  was released in june this analysis was used by the palco companies and the government agencies to develop proposed harvesting prescriptions 
prescriptions for the van duzen watershed were approved in january prescriptions for a third watershed lower eel eel delta were approved in march the freshwater  van duzen and lower eel prescriptions each resulted in a reduction in the size of the streamside buffers set forth in the environmental plans and also provide for geologic reviews in order to conduct any harvesting activities on potential landslide prone areas 
this effectively reduced both the size and operational restrictions in respect of landslide prone areas 
the analysis for a fourth watershed  elk river  was submitted in mid for agency and public review  and prescriptions for elk river have been developed and are undergoing review by the relevant agencies 
the hcp required the palco companies  together with the government agencies  to establish a schedule resulting in completion of the initial watershed analysis process for all covered lands within five years 
however  due largely to the number of agencies involved and the depth and complexity of the analyses  the process has proven to require more time than originally anticipated 
accordingly  the palco companies have been working with the government agencies to establish an appropriate timeline and to streamline the process for implementation of watershed analysis on the remaining portions of palco timberlands to ensure that such studies are time and cost efficient  and that such studies continue to provide scientific results necessary to evaluate potential changes to the harvesting restrictions on those lands 
the palco companies have received an extension to march of the time in which the watershed analysis process must be completed 
a proposed streamlined process is undergoing review by the relevant agencies 
the hcp imposes certain restrictions on the use of roads on the timberlands covered by the hcp during several months of the year and during periods of wet weather 
however  palco has conducted  and expects to be able to continue to conduct  some harvesting during these periods 
an adaptive management change approved in for the road restrictions has improved the ability to construct and use roads on the palco timberlands in ways that are consistent with the operational needs of the palco companies 
the hcp also requires that miles of roads be stormproofed ie  reconstructed to reduce sediment generation on an annual basis and that certain other roads must be improved or repaired 
the nature of this work requires that it be performed in the dry periods of the year 
to date  over miles of roads have been stormproofed 
the hcp contains an adaptive management provision  which both the state and federal governments have clarified will be implemented on a timely and efficient basis  and in a manner which will be both biologically and economically sound 
this provision allows the palco companies to propose changes to many of the hcp prescriptions based on  among other things  economic considerations 
the regulatory agencies have also clarified that in applying this adaptive 
table of contents management provision  to the extent the changes proposed do not result in the jeopardy of a particular species  the regulatory agencies will consider the practicality of the suggested changes  including the cost and economic feasibility and viability 
the palco companies and the agencies have implemented various adaptive management changes related to wildlife and rare plants  and other changes relating to roads and streamside buffers 
these adaptive management changes have increased palco s ability to conduct harvesting operations and or reduce operating costs while still meeting the obligations of the environmental plans 
water quality laws and regulations dealing with water quality are impacting the palco companies primarily in four areas efforts by the federal environmental protection agency the epa and the north coast water board to establish total maximum daily load limits tmdls in watercourses that have been declared to be water quality impaired  actions by the north coast water board to impose waste discharge reporting requirements in respect of watersheds on the palco timberlands and in some cases  clean up or prevention measures  actions by the north coast water board during the thp approval process which impose certain operational requirements on individual thps  and a directive of the north coast water board to its staff to develop watershed wide waste discharge requirements wwdrs for the freshwater and elk river watersheds 
under the cwa  the epa is required to establish tmdls for relevant contaminants in watercourses that have been declared to be water quality impaired 
the epa and the north coast water board are in the process of establishing tmdls for many northern california rivers and certain of their tributaries  including nine watercourses that flow within the palco timberlands 
on the palco timberlands  the relevant contaminant is simple sediment dust  dirt and gravel that is abundant in watercourses largely as a function of the area s normally heavy rainfall and soil that erodes easily 
the company expects this process to continue into in december  the epa issued a report dealing with tmdls on two of the nine watercourses 
the agency indicated that the requirements under the hcp would significantly address the sediment issues that resulted in tmdl requirements for these watercourses 
the north coast water board has begun the process of establishing the tmdl requirements applicable to two other watercourses on the palco timberlands  with a targeted completion of for these two watercourses 
scotia llc s scientists are actively working with north coast water board staff to ensure these tmdls recognize and incorporate the environmental protection measures of the hcp 
the final tmdl requirements applicable to the palco timberlands may require aquatic protection measures that are different from or in addition to those in the hcp or that result from the prescriptions to be developed pursuant to the watershed analysis process provided for in the hcp 
for each of the three winter periods since  the north coast water board has required palco to submit reports of waste discharge in order to conduct winter harvesting operations in the freshwater and elk river watersheds 
after consideration of these reports  the north coast water board imposed requirements on the palco companies to implement additional mitigation and erosion control practices in these watersheds for each of the three winter operating periods 
the north coast water board has also extended the requirements for certain mitigation and erosion control practices in three additional watersheds bear  jordan and stitz creek 
the palco companies and the north coast water board are currently in discussions to determine what these measures will be 
the requirements imposed to date by the north coast water board have significantly increased operating costs  additional requirements imposed in the future could further increase costs and cause delays in thp approvals 
the north coast water board has also issued a clean up and abatement order the elk river order for the elk river watershed  which is aimed at addressing existing sediment production sites through clean up actions 
the north coast water board has also initiated the process which could result in similar orders for the freshwater and bear creek watersheds  and is contemplating similar actions for the jordan and stitz creek watersheds 
the elk river order has resulted in increased costs to palco that could extend over a number of years 
additional orders in other watersheds should they be issued  may also result in further cost increases 
palco s appeal of the elk river order to the state water resources control board the state water board was denied 
palco has appealed the decision of the state water board in state court  but is holding such appeal in abeyance until resolution of the thp no 
lawsuit described below 
see item legal proceedings forest products litigation 
in addition to the foregoing actions  the north coast water board in december directed its staff to create wwdrs for the freshwater and elk river watersheds 
as harvesting activities on the palco timberlands cannot readily be moved between watersheds due to  among other things  historic harvest patterns  adjacency restrictions  and the age 
table of contents classes of trees  that action and the other matters described above could  in addition to the potential effects noted above  individually or collectively result in reduced harvest 
in that regard  the staff of the north coast water board has not yet formulated the required wwdrs for the freshwater and elk river watersheds  and has on several occasions postponed its projected date for their completion 
as a result  the north coast water board has failed to release for harvest a number of scotia llc s thps that are located in the freshwater and elk river watersheds  even though these thps have already been approved by the other government agencies which review scotia llc s thps and are in compliance with the hcp 
the delay in receiving the release of these thps has adversely impacted the cash flows of both palco and scotia llc 
furthermore  it is likely that additional delays in the development of the freshwater and elk river wwdrs will occur  and such delays could have adverse impacts beyond those currently being experienced 
on february   the executive officer of the staff of the north coast water boardpublicly announced approval of the release of additional thps such that palco would be allowed to harvest up to of the harvest limit established by the cdf for the freshwater and elk river watersheds 
since this announcement  palco and scotia llc have continued their efforts with the north coast water board staff to obtain the release of additional thps and will make a presentation to the north coast water board itself on march   in furtherance of these efforts 
no assurance can be given that the efforts of palco and scotia llc will be successful 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and investing and financing activities forest products operations for further information regarding this matter  including extraordinary actions which palco and scotia llc could be forced to take if their efforts are not successful 
california senate bill  which became effective january   provides regional water quality control boards with additional authority related to the approval of thps on land within impaired watersheds 
under this law  a thp may not be approved if the appropriate regional water quality control board finds  based on substantial evidence  that the timber operations proposed in the plan will result in a discharge into a watercourse that has been classified as impaired due to sedimentthat causes or contributes  to a violation of the regional water quality control plan 
the company is uncertain of the operational and financial effects which will ultimately result from senate bill while this provision has not yet been invoked in respect of the palco timberlands  because substantially all rivers and waterbodies on the palco timberlands are classified as sediment impaired  implementation of this law could result in delays in obtaining approval of thps  lower harvest levels and increased costs and additional protection measures beyond those contained in the hcp

lawsuit under item legal proceedings forests products litigation 
impact of future legislation laws  regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations dealing with mgi s business are subject to change and new laws and regulations are frequently introduced concerning the california timber industry 
from time to time  bills are introduced in the california legislature and the us congress which relate to the business of mgi  including the protection and acquisition of old growth and other timberlands  threatened and endangered species  environmental protection  air and water quality and the restriction  regulation and administration of timber harvesting practices 
in addition to existing and possible new or modified statutory enactments  regulatory requirements and administrative and legal actions  the california timber industry remains subject to potential california or local ballot initiatives  and federal and california judicial decisions which could affect timber harvesting practices 
it is not possible to assess the effect of such future legislative  judicial and administrative developments on mgi or its business

table of contents competition and regulation and other industry factors there is intense competition among companies in the real estate investment and development business 
sales and payments on real estate sales obligations depend  in part  on available financing and or disposable income and  therefore  are affected by changes in general economic conditions and other factors 
the real estate development and commercial real estate businesses are subject to other risks such as shifts in population  fluctuations in the real estate market  and unpredictable changes in the desirability of residential  commercial and industrial areas

racing operations general shrp  ltd 
owns and operates sam houston race park  a texas class horse racing facility located within the greater houston metropolitan area and valley race park  a greyhound racing facility located in harlingen  texas 
in january  a subsidiary of the company applied to the texas racing commission the racing commission for an additional license to construct and operate a class horse racing facility in laredo  texas 
the review process is only in the preliminary stages  and there can be no assurance that the company will obtain this additional license as  among other things  there is a competing applicant 
racing operations and facilities sam houston race park and valley race park offer pari mutuel wagering on live thoroughbred  quarter horse and greyhound racing during meets approved by the racing commission on a yearly basis and on simulcast horse and greyhound racing throughout the year 
under the texas racing act and related regulations collectively  the racing act  commission revenues for both facilities are a designated portion of the pari mutuel handle 
revenues are also earned on live and simulcast racing as both a guest and host track ie both facilities receive broadcasts of live racing conducted from other racetracks under various guest simulcast agreements and broadcast live racing conducted at sam houston race park and valley race park to other race tracks and off track wagering sites under various host simulcast agreements 
sam houston race park and valley race park also derive revenues from food and beverages sales  admission and parking fees  group sales  and advertising sales 
regulation of racing operations the ownership and operation of horse and greyhound racetracks in texas are subject to significant regulation by the racing commission under the racing act 
the racing act provides  among other things  for the allocation of wagering proceeds among betting participants  purses  racetracks  the state of texas and for other purposes  and empowers the racing commission to license and regulate substantially all aspects of horse and greyhound racing in the state 
the racing commission must approve the number of live racing days that may be offered each year  as well as all simulcast agreements 
class horse racetracks in texas are entitled to conduct at least seventeen weeks of live racing 
table of contents for each breed of horses thoroughbreds and quarter horses  while greyhound tracks are entitled to conduct live racing nearly year round 
marketing and competition shrp  ltd 
s management believes that the majority of sam houston race park s patrons reside within a mile radius  which includes most of the greater houston metropolitan area  and that a secondary market of occasional patrons exists outside the mile radius but within a mile radius of the facility 
sam houston race park uses a number of marketing strategies in an attempt to reach these people and make them more frequent visitors to sam houston race park 
recent changes to strategies include increased newspaper ad sizes  an expanded outdoor advertising campaign  radio advertising  increased marketing of items offered outside of the racing product  a vip program with exclusive promotional offers  and greater focus on casual customers 
valley race park employs similar strategies to attract patrons 
both race parks also rent out facilities and grounds for group events  which are often unrelated to racing but which increase revenues and expose the facility to potential customers 
sam houston race park had days of live racing in  a significantly greater number than usual as sam houston race park accommodated requests from the racing industry to alleviate scheduling issues at the two other texas class horse tracks 
sam houston race park currently has days of live racing scheduled for valley race park had live racing performances over days during  and currently has live racing performances over days scheduled for sam houston race park competes with other forms of wagering and entertainment  including a louisiana racino horse or dog tracks with slot machines or other forms of gaming located approximately miles from houston  increasing use of the internet for horse wagering and general gaming  casinos located approximately miles from houston  a greyhound racetrack located miles away  a wide range of sporting events and other entertainment activities in the houston area  the texas state lottery  and charitable bingo 
live racing also faces increasing competitive pressure from simulcast signals broadcast by racinos  which are able to offer larger purses and competitive fields 
sam houston race park could in the future also compete with other forms of gambling in texas  including casino gambling on indian reservations or otherwise 
while sam houston race park believes that the location of sam houston race park is a competitive advantage over the other more distant gaming ventures mentioned above  the most significant challenges for sam houston race park are to maintain its customer base in spite of the above competitive pressures and to develop and educate new racing fans in a market where pari mutuel wagering had been absent from the s to other competitive factors faced by sam houston race park include the allocation of sufficient live racing days by the racing commission and attraction of a sufficient number and quality of race horses to run at sam houston race park  particularly in view of the larger purses able to be offered by racinos 
competitive factors faced by valley race park include the texas state lottery  charitable bingo and internet based gaming  as well as the attraction of sufficient greyhounds to run live racing  along with the ability of valley race park to market its simulcast signal due to its brief live racing season 
the texas legislature convenes its regular session every other year 
it is expected that this body will  during its january to june regular session  consider measures to enhance state revenues through additional forms of gaming such as video lottery terminals at existing horse and dog racing tracks  gaming on indian reservations  and full casinos 
the company will vigorously pursue any such legislation that is favorable to it 
as any legislation expanding gaming in texas would likely require the approval of two thirds of each legislative house and a majority of the state s voters  no assurance can be given that any such legislation will be enacted or become effective 
moreover  it is not possible to determine what the provisions of any such legislation will be or its effect on the company

in march  an action entitled environmental protection information association  sierra club v 
california department of forestry and fire protection  california department of fish and game  the pacific lumber company  scotia pacific company llc  salmon creek corporation  et al 
the epic syp permits lawsuit was filed in superior court in humboldt county  california no 
cv 
this action alleged  among other things  various violations of the cesa and the ceqa  and challenged  among other things  the validity and legality of the syp and the california permits 
the plaintiffs sought  among other things  to set aside california s approval of the syp and the california permits and injunctive relief to prevent implementation of thps approved in reliance upon these documents 
in march  a similar action  entitled united steelworkers of america  afl cio  clc  and donald kegley v 
california department of forestry and fire protection  the pacific lumber company  scotia pacific company llc and salmon creek corporation the uswa lawsuit  was filed in humboldt county superior court no 
cv challenging the validity and legality of the syp 
the epic syp permits and uswa lawsuits were consolidated for trial 

table of contents following trial  the court on october  entered a judgment invalidating the syp and the california permits due to several deficiencies in agency procedures and the failure of palco to submit a complete and comprehensible syp 
the court s decision  however  allowed for harvesting on thps which rely on the syp and were approved prior to july  the short term effect of the ruling was to preclude approval  under the syp  of a small number of thps which were under review but had not been approved  and a minor reduction in harvesting that had been expected from these specific thps 
as a result of this case  palco has since october  when the court issued a stay order preventing future reliance upon the syp  been obtaining review and approval of new thps under a procedure provided for in the forest practice rules that does not depend upon the syp and the california permits 
palco expects to follow this procedure until the option a plan is approved 
see item business forest products operations timber and timberlands 
palco and the state of california have appealed the october   decision 
in september  the court granted the plaintiffs request for reimbursement of an aggregate of million in attorneys fees and other expenses incurred in connection with these matters 
palco and the state of california have also appealed this decision 
in july  an action entitled environmental protection information center v 
the pacific lumber company  scotia pacific company llc the bear creek lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the northern district of california no 
c  and later amended to add the epa as a defendant 
the lawsuit alleges that palco s harvesting and other forestry activities under certain approved thps will result in discharges of pollutants in violation of the cwa 
the plaintiff asserts that the cwa requires the defendants to obtain a permit from the north coast water board before beginning timber harvesting and road construction activities and is seeking to enjoin these activities until such permit has been obtained 
the plaintiff also seeks civil penalties of up to  per day for the defendant s alleged continued violation of the cwa 
on october   in connection with certain motions that had been filed  the court upheld the validity of an epa regulation which exempts harvesting and other forestry activities from certain discharge requirements 
both state and federal agencies  along with palco and other timber companies  have relied upon this regulation for more than years 
however  the court interpreted the regulation in such a way as to narrow the forestry operations which are exempted  thereby limiting the regulation s applicability and subjecting culverts and ditches to permit requirements 
this ruling has widespread implications for the timber industry in the united states 
the case is not yet final as the trial has not yet been held  and there are many unresolved issues involving interpretation of the court s decision and its application to actual operations 
should the decision ultimately become final and held to apply to all palco s timber operations  it may have some or all of the following effects imposing additional permitting requirements  delaying approvals of thps  increasing harvesting costs  and adding water protection measures beyond those contained in the hcp 
nonetheless  it is not likely that civil penalties will be awarded for operations that occurred prior to the court s decision due to the historical reliance by timber companies on the regulation and the company s belief that the requirements under the hcp are adequate to ensure that sediment and pollutants from harvesting activities on the palco timberlands will not reach levels harmful to the environment 
while the impact of a conclusion to this case that upholds the october   ruling may be adverse  the company does not believe that such an outcome would have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
nevertheless  due to the numerous ways in which the court s interpretation of the regulation could be applied to actual operations  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
on november   two similar actions entitled alan cook  et al 
v 
gary clark  et al 
the cook action and steve cave  et al 
v 
gary clark  et al 
the cave action were filed in humboldt county superior court no 
s dr and dr  respectively  which also name palco and certain affiliates as defendants 
on april   the plaintiffs in these actions filed amended complaints and served the defendants with notice of the actions 
the cook action alleges  among other things  that defendants logging practices have contributed to an increase in flooding along freshwater creek which runs through the palco timberlands  resulting in personal injury and damage to the plaintiffs properties 
plaintiffs further allege that in order to have thps approved in the affected areas  the defendants engaged in certain unfair business practices 
the plaintiffs seek  among other things  compensatory and exemplary damages  injunctive relief  and appointment of a receiver to ensure that the watershed is restored 
the cave action contains similar allegations and requests similar relief with respect to the elk river watershed a portion of which is contained on the palco timberlands 
the company does not believe the resolution of these actions should result in a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
on february   the district attorney of humboldt county filed a civil suit entitled the people of the state of california v 
the pacific lumber company  scotia pacific holding company and salmon creek corporation in the humboldt county superior court no 
dr the humboldt da action 
the suit was filed under california s 
table of contents unfair competition law and alleges that palco used certain unfair business practices in connection with completion of the headwaters agreement  and that this resulted in palco being able to harvest significantly more trees under the environmental plans than would have otherwise been the case 
the suit sought a variety of remedies including a civil penalty of  for each additional tree that has been or will be harvested due to this alleged increase in harvest  as well as restitution and an injunction in respect of the additional timber harvesting allegedly being conducted 
in response to motions filed by palco for sanctions and dismissal of this suit  on april   the court issued a ruling requiring the district attorney to amend his suit to prove that extrinsic fraud occurred 
in addition  the court eliminated the remedies being sought  other than for civil penalties  and suggested that it would be inappropriate to base civil penalties on the additional trees harvested 
the court also ruled that it declined at this juncture to impose sanctions on the district attorney 
the district attorney subsequently amended his suit  and palco later filed new motions to dismiss and for sanctions 
after delays resulting from the district attorney s efforts to disqualify the trial judge  and that judge s later self disqualification  a hearing on these motions was held on february  the court rejected the sanctions motion  but has not yet ruled on the motion for dismissal 
the company believes that this suit is without merit and that the april   ruling diminished significantly its exposure with respect to this matter  however  there can be no assurance that palco will ultimately prevail  or that an adverse outcome would not be material to the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
on december   an action entitled humboldt watershed council  et al 
v 
north coast regional water quality board  et al 
the hwc lawsuit  naming palco as a real party in interest  was filed in the humboldt county superior court no

the plaintiffs allege that the north coast water board should have required waste discharge reports in respect of all timber harvesting activities in the freshwater and elk river watersheds  including those of palco 
this action has been dismissed by the plaintiffs 
on november   an action entitled environmental protection information center  et al 
v 
california department of forestry and fire protection  et al 
was filed in humboldt county superior court no 
cv 
this action sought an order staying or setting aside cdf s approval of six thps along the van duzen river  and an order requiring cdf to conduct further review and analysis of the six thps and to refrain from reliance on information not made available for public review and comment 
following denial by the trial judge of the plaintiffs request for injunctive relief and various appellate proceedings which resulted in harvesting operations being allowed to continue  the case was dismissed by the plaintiffs 
on november   an action entitled environmental protection information center v 
us fish wildlife service  noaa fisheries  et al 
no 
c was filed in the us district court for the northern district of california the epic usfws noaa lawsuit 
this lawsuit alleges that two federal agencies have violated certain federal laws and related regulations in connection with their oversight of the hcp and related incidental take permits issued by the federal government the federal permits

regulatory and environmental matters as well as certain pending legal matters play a significant role in the company s forest products operations 
see item business forest products operations regulatory and environmental matters and note for further discussion of these matters 
regulatory compliance and related litigation have caused and may continue to cause delays in approval of thps and delays in harvesting on thps once they are approved 
this has resulted and may continue to result in a decline in harvest  an increase in the cost of logging operations  and increased costs related to timber harvest litigation 
the cash flows of palco and scopac have both been adversely impacted by the failure of the north coast water board to release for harvest a number of already approved thps 
scotia llc expects that without the release of 
table of contents additional thps  its cash flows from operations  together with funds available under its line of credit  will be inadequate to pay the entire amount of interest due on the july   payment date for its timber notes 
palco is in default under the palco credit agreement and estimates that  without the prompt release of a substantial portion of these thps and necessary amendments to the palco credit agreement  its cash flow from operations  together with funds available under the palco credit agreement  will not provide sufficient liquidity to fund its current level of operations 
for further information  see financial condition and investing and financing activities forest products operations

palco has continued to examine ways in which to achieve additional cost savings 
during  palco opened a new planer facility in scotia and began construction on a new sawmill in scotia  california 
the project is expected to cost million million of which was expended in with the last phase scheduled for completion in the third quarter of subject to available cash 
funds for this project are being provided from existing cash resources and borrowings under the palco credit agreement 
as part of the project  the carlotta mill was permanently closed  and the equipment from the carlotta mill is in the process of being moved to the new mill in scotia

these requirements have not yet been formulated  and the north coast water board has failed to release for harvest a number of thps already approved by the other government agencies which review scotia llc s thps 
the failure of the north coast water board to release these thps for harvest has adversely impacted the cash flows of both palco and scotia llc 
scotia llc estimates that  without the prompt release of a substantial portion of these thps  its cash flows from operations  together with funds available under the scotia llc line of credit described below  will be inadequate to pay the entire amount of interest due on the july  timber notes payment date  which would constitute an event of default under the timber notes indenture 
palco is in default under the palco credit agreement described below and estimates that  without the prompt release of a substantial portion of these thps and necessary amendments to the palco credit agreement  its cash flow from operations  together with funds available under the palco credit agreement  will not provide sufficient liquidity to fund its current level of operations 
palco and scotia llc are continuing efforts to obtain the clearance of the north coast water board of sufficient thps 
palco has received a limited waiver of the default through march   from the lender under the palco credit agreement and is seeking a more permanent solution to the default 
there can be no assurance that these efforts with the north coast water board and the lender under the palco credit agreement will be successful 

table of contents in the event of a failure to pay interest on the timber notes in full when due  the trustee or the holders of at least of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the timber notes may cause all principal  interest and other amounts related to the timber notes to become immediately due and payable 
also  in the event of a failure by palco or scotia llc to perform its respective covenants or agreements under the master purchase agreement or by palco to perform its covenants or agreements under the services agreement that continues for days after notice from the trustee or the holders of or more of the outstanding principal amount of the timber notes  the holders of a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the timber notes may cause all principal  interest and other amounts related to the timber notes to become immediately due and payable 
in the event of any such acceleration  the agent under the scotia llc line of credit may also accelerate the advances then outstanding thereunder 
if such accelerations of timber notes and or advances under the scotia llc line of credit occur  the trustee may exercise all rights under the timber notes indenture and related security documents  including applying funds to pay accelerated amounts  and selling the scotia llc timberlands and other assets and using the proceeds thereof to pay accelerated amounts 
in the event that scotia llc were to seek protection by filing under the bankruptcy code  all amounts related to the timber notes would become immediately due and payable under the timber notes indenture and all advances under the scotia llc line of credit agreement could be accelerated 
the foregoing rights of the trustee and holders of timber notes are subject to the rights of scotia llc under the bankruptcy code 
without an extension of the limited waiver of palco s default under the palco credit agreement and a restructuring or replacement of that facility  palco s lender may take any of the following actions reduce the amount of funds available to palco for borrowing  refuse to make new loans to or issue new letters of credit for the benefit of palco  declare any or all loans and other amounts owed under the agreement to be immediately due and payable  require palco to cash collateralize all outstanding letters of credit  or pursue its other rights and remedies under the palco credit agreement and related security agreements 
the existence of the default also requires palco to pay interest on amounts borrowed under the palco credit agreement at a per annum rate higher than the rate at which interest would be owed if no default existed 
if any acceleration under the palco credit agreement occurs  then the agent for the lender may exercise all rights under that agreement and related security documents  including selling palco s assets and using the proceeds thereof to pay the accelerated amounts 
in the event that palco were to seek protection by filing under the bankruptcy code  all loans and other amounts owed under the palco credit agreement would become immediately due and payable 
the foregoing rights of the lender under the palco credit agreement are subject to the rights of palco under the bankruptcy code 
in the event of a scotia llc default or a palco liquidity shortfall  whether resulting from a failure to extend the limited waiver past march   any action described above taken by palco s lender  or otherwise  palco and scotia llc could be forced to take extraordinary actions  which may include reducing expenditures by laying off employees and shutting down various operations  seeking other sources of liquidity  such as from asset sales  and considering seeking protection by filing under the bankruptcy code 
on december   standard poor s ratings services s p lowered palco s credit rating from b to ccc 
as a result  palco may be required to post a security deposit for workers compensation liabilities in july  in an amount that has not been determined but that could be material to palco s liquidity  capital resources  and results of operations 
if improvements in palco s liquidity  capital resources  and results of operations produce an upward revision in palco s credit rating  or if a waiver of this requirement is allowed under applicable law  then posting of such a security deposit may not be necessary 
palco management is in the process of evaluating the potential amount of such a security deposit  if required 
there can be no assurance that such a security deposit will not be required or that  if required  the amount will not be material 
palco management is also evaluating whether other potential obligations or unanticipated adverse financial reports may result from the s p credit action described above 
the liquidity issues being experienced by palco and scotia llc could result in claims against and could have adverse impacts on maxxam parent  mghi and or mgi 
for example  under erisa law  were palco to terminate its pension plan  maxxam parent and its wholly owned subsidiaries would be jointly and severally liable for any unfunded pension plan obligations 
the unfunded obligation attributable to palco s pension plan as of december  is estimated to have been in the range of approximately million based upon current annuity placement interest rate assumptions 
in addition  it is possible that certain transactions could be entered into in connection with a potential restructuring or reorganization of palco or scotia llc  such as a sale of all or a portion of the equity ownership in palco and or scotia llc  a sale of a substantial portion of palco s and or scotia llc s assets and or a cancellation of some or all of palco s and or scotia llc s indebtedness  which could require the utilization of all or a substantial portion of  
table of contents or the loss of significant portion of  the company s net operating losses for federal and state income tax purposes and could require tax payments 
in addition  there can be no assurance that certain other pending legal  regulatory and environmental matters or future governmental regulations  legislation or judicial or administrative decisions  adverse weather conditions  or low lumber or log prices  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

the scotia llc line of credit allows scotia llc to borrow up to one year s interest on the timber notes the scotia llc line of credit 
on june   the scotia llc line of credit was extended to july  at or near the completion of such extension  scotia llc intends to request that the scotia llc line of credit be extended for an additional period of not less than days 
if not extended  scotia llc may draw upon the full amount available 
the amount drawn would be repayable in semiannual installments on each note payment date after the payment of certain other items  including the aggregate minimum principal amortization amount  as defined  then due  commencing approximately two and one half years following the date of the draw 
at december   scotia llc could have borrowed a maximum of million under the scotia llc line of credit  and there were million in borrowings outstanding under the facility 
at january   the maximum availability under the scotia llc line of credit was million  and there were million in borrowings outstanding under this facility 
on the note payment date in january  scotia llc had million set aside in the note payment account to pay the million of interest due net of million of additional interest due in respect of timber notes held by scotia llc 
the funds available under the scotia llc line of credit were used to pay the remaining million of interest due 
scotia llc repaid million of principal on the timber notes an amount equal to scheduled amortization  as set forth in the timber notes indenture scheduled amortization using funds held in the scheduled amortization reserve account  a reserve account used to support principal payments on the timber notes sar account 
on the note payment date in july  scotia llc used million net of million of additional interest due in respect of timber notes held by scotia llc of the funds available under the scotia llc line of credit to pay the entire million of interest due 
scotia llc repaid million of principal on the timber notes an amount equal to scheduled amortization using funds held in the sar account 
on the note payment date in january  scotia llc used million net of million of additional interest due in respect of timber notes held by scotia llc of the funds available under the scotia llc line of credit to pay the entire million of interest due 
scotia llc repaid million of principal on the timber notes an amount equal to scheduled amortization using funds held in the sar account 
with respect to the note payment date in july  as a result of the matters discussed above  scotia llc may not have adequate funds available under the scotia llc line of credit to pay the entire million of interest which will be due net of million of additional interest which would be due in respect of timber notes held by scotia llc 
should this occur  scotia llc would be in default under the timber notes indenture 
should a default not occur  scotia llc anticipates paying the million of principal due on the timber notes an amount equal to scheduled amortization by using funds held in the sar account 
during  million of funds from the sar account were used to repurchase million principal amount of timber notes  as permitted under the timber notes indenture  resulting in a loss of million net of unamortized deferred financing costs on the repurchase of debt 
due to its highly leveraged condition  scotia llc is more sensitive than less leveraged companies to factors affecting its operations  including low log prices  governmental regulation and litigation affecting its timber harvesting practices see results of operations forest products operations above and note  and general economic conditions 
scotia llc s cash flows from operations are significantly impacted by harvest volumes and log prices 
the master purchase agreement between scotia llc and palco see item business forest products operations relationships among the palco companies contemplates that all sales of logs by scotia llc to palco will be at fair market value based on stumpage prices for each species and category of timber 
the master purchase 
table of contents agreement provides that if the purchase price equals or exceeds the sbe price and a structuring price set forth in a schedule to the timber notes indenture  the purchase price is deemed to be at fair market value 
if the purchase price equals or exceeds the sbe price  but is less than the structuring price  then scotia llc is required to engage an independent forestry consultant to confirm that the purchase price reflects fair market value 
in december  the state board of equalization adopted the new harvest value schedule for the first half of the prices published in that schedule reflected a increase in the sbe price for small redwood logs and a increase for small douglas fir logs from the prices published for the second half of on january   s p announced that it was placing its ratings on all classes of timber notes on creditwatch with negative implications 
s p indicated that the creditwatch placements reflected palco s difficulties in obtaining approval from the north coast water board to move forward with harvesting related to certain thps 
s p also indicated that any additional delays in the ability to harvest on the scotia llc timberlands and the inability to generate adequate revenue could put into question whether scotia llc will have sufficient funds to make payment of full and timely interest on the july timber notes note payment date 
in addition  on february   moody s investors services lowered the ratings on all classes of the timber notes  reflecting concerns over continued weak cash flow from timber operations due to difficulties in obtaining approval of thps 
the rating on the class a timber notes was lowered from a to baa  the rating on the class a timber notes was lowered from a to baa  and the rating on the class a timber notes was lowered from baa to ba all three ratings will remain on review for possible downgrade  as moody s noted that there is some risk that there will be insufficient cash to make full payment of interest on the july note payment date 
on january   palco entered into an asset based credit agreement with a bank the palco credit agreement 
this agreement provides for a three year revolving facility after which palco may request a one year extension 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at rates based upon and at variable margins above libor or the prime rate  and are secured by the substantial portion of palco s assets 
effective february   the palco credit agreement was amended by  among other things reducing the maximum amount of potential borrowings from million to million  decreasing the borrowing base reserve by million and thereby increasing the amount able to be borrowed by the same amount  and requiring more frequent submissions of borrowing base certificates 
at december   million in borrowings and million in letters of credit were outstanding under the palco credit agreement 
in accordance with the agreement  palco is required to maintain a certain base level of borrowings through february   based on certain collateral balances 
palco is required to meet certain quarterly earnings thresholds under a covenant of the palco credit agreement 
as of december   palco was not in compliance with this covenant 
capital expenditures have been made during the past three years to improve production efficiency and reduce operating costs 
in april  palco commenced a mill improvement project  including construction of a new sawmill in scotia  california 
the project is expected to cost million million of which was expended in with the last phase scheduled for completion in the third quarter of funds for this project are being provided from existing cash resources and borrowings under the palco credit agreement 
palco believes that the new mill will improve annual results from operations by at least million  assuming an adequate supply of logs 
as part of the project  equipment from palco s carlotta mill is in the process of being moved to the new mill in scotia  and the carlotta mill was permanently closed 
the carlotta mill and other equipment would be used to process large diameter logs 
completion of this project is  however  subject to successful resolution of the liquidity problems being experienced by palco 
management is considering alternative uses for the carlotta property 
capital expenditures  excluding expenditures for the new sawmill and for timberlands  are estimated to be between million and million for subject to available resources  palco and scotia llc may purchase additional timberlands from time to time as appropriate opportunities arise 
the company estimates that funding requirements for pension benefits for will range from million to million 
palco s share of these amounts ranges from million to million 
palco will require funds available under the palco credit agreement in order to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next year 
palco s ability to meet such requirements could be adversely affected should palco be unsuccessful in its efforts to obtain a more permanent solution to the default discussed above 
furthermore  palco s cash flows from operations may be adversely affected by diminished availability of logs from scotia llc  lower 
table of contents lumber prices  adverse weather conditions  pending legal  regulatory and environmental matters or increased funding requirements for its pension plan 
see results of operations forest products operations above  as well as note  for discussion of the regulatory  environmental and legal matters affecting harvest levels and operating costs 
with respect to long term liquidity  until such time as palco has adequate cash flows from operations and or dividends from scotia llc  there can be no assurance that palco will be able to meet its working capital  capital expenditures and debt service obligations 
liquidity  capital resources and results of operations in the long term may continue to be adversely affected by the same factors affecting short term cash flows from operations  as discussed above 
real estate operations capital expenditures and real estate improvements and development costs are expected to be approximately million to million in the company expects that these expenditures will be funded by existing cash and available credit facilities 
the company believes that the existing cash and credit facilities of its real estate subsidiaries are sufficient to fund the working capital and capital expenditure requirements of such subsidiaries for with respect to the long term liquidity of such subsidiaries  the company believes that their ability to generate cash from the sale of their existing real estate  together with their ability to obtain financing and joint venture partners  should provide sufficient funds to meet their working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
pdmpi and its subsidiaries  however  have required advances from maxxam parent in prior years to fund their operations  and pdmpi may require such advances in the future 
racing operations capital expenditures and investments in new ventures are expected to be between million and million in subsequent to december   shrp  ltd 
borrowed million from maxxam parent to fund its capital expenditures and improve its working capital position 
shrp  ltd 
s management expects that shrp  ltd 
will require additional advances from maxxam parent to fund its operations and capital expenditures in the future 
shrp  ltd 
is experiencing strong competition from internet wagering and racinos in surrounding states 
these factors will also play a role in shrp  ltd

kaiser s operations as a result of the filing of the cases  claims against the debtors for principal and accrued interest on secured and unsecured indebtedness existing on the filing date are stayed while the debtors continue business operations as debtors in possession  subject to the control and supervision of the court 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the effect of the cases on the businesses of the debtors 
with respect to the company s interest in kaiser  the debtors have indicated that the equity of kaiser s stockholders will likely be cancelled without consideration

racing operations the texas legislature convenes its regular session every other year 
it is expected that this body will  during its january to june regular session  consider measures to enhance state revenues through additional forms of gaming such as video lottery terminals at existing horse and dog racing tracks  gaming on indian reservations  and full casinos 
the company will vigorously pursue any such legislation that is favorable to it 
as any legislation expanding gaming in texas would likely require the approval of two thirds of each legislative house and a majority of the state s voters  no assurance can be given that any such legislation will be enacted or become effective 
moreover  it is not possible to determine what the provisions of any such legislation will be or its effect on the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates this section contains statements which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the pslra 
see item business general and below for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires 
table of contents the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company re evaluates its estimates and judgments on a regular  ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to changed circumstances and conditions 
the following accounting policies and estimates are considered critical in light of the potentially material impact that the estimates  judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies might have on the company s reported financial information 
principles of consolidation deconsolidation of kaiser under generally accepted accounting principles for entities consolidated through voting interests  consolidation is generally required for investments of more than of the outstanding voting stock of an investee  except when control is not held by the majority owner 
under these principles  legal reorganization or bankruptcy represent conditions which can preclude consolidation in instances where control rests with the bankruptcy court  rather than the majority owner 
as discussed under results of operations consolidated operations deconsolidation of kaiser  on february   kaiser and certain of its subsidiaries filed for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result  the company deconsolidated kaiser s financial results beginning february   and began reporting its investment in kaiser using the cost method 
through february   under generally accepted principles of consolidation  the company had recognized losses in excess of its investment in kaiser of million 
since kaiser s results are no longer consolidated and the company believes that it is not probable that it will be obligated to fund losses related to its investment in kaiser  any adjustments reflected in kaiser s financial statements subsequent to february  relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities or the effects on existing stockholders deficit  as well as adjustments made to kaiser s financial information for loss contingencies and other matters  are not expected to affect the company s financial results 
the company expects to consider reversal of these losses when either kaiser s bankruptcy is resolved and the amount of the company s remaining investment in kaiser is determined or the company disposes of the kaiser shares 
accordingly  these consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments related to the deconsolidation of kaiser other than presenting the company s investment in kaiser using the cost method  which reflects the investment as a single amount on its balance sheet  and discontinuing the recording of earnings or losses from kaiser after february  when either of the events described above occurs  the company will re evaluate the appropriate accounting treatment of its investment in kaiser based upon the facts and circumstances at such time 
the debtors have indicated that the equity of kaiser s stockholders  including the company  will likely be cancelled without consideration as a result of kaiser s plan of reorganization 
loss contingencies the company is involved in various claims  lawsuits  environmental matters and other proceedings discussed in note such matters involve uncertainty as to possible losses the company may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
the company accrues and charges to income estimated losses from contingencies when it is probable at the balance sheet date that an asset has been impaired or liability incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
differences between estimates recorded and actual amounts determined in subsequent periods are treated as changes in accounting estimates ie  they are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be losses  with no retroactive restatement 
the company estimates the probability of losses on legal contingencies based on the advice of internal and external counsel  the outcomes from similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative and regulatory developments  and other factors 
for larger environmental matters  the company estimates the losses using estimates prepared by third party experts and the advice of internal and external counsel 
risks and uncertainties are inherent with respect to the ultimate outcome of litigation and environmental contingencies 
see notes and for further discussion of the company s material legal and environmental contingencies 

table of contents income taxes the company accrues and charges to income estimated taxes when it is probable at the balance sheet date that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  including situations in which the company has and has not received tax assessments from the relevant taxing authority 
taxes are provided in those instances where the company considers it probable that additional tax may be due in excess of amounts reflected in our tax returns as filed 
the company believes amounts currently provided for any such potential assessments will not be settled within the next twelve months and settlement of such amounts would not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and or liquidity 
see note for further discussion of the company s income taxes 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances as of december   the company had million of deferred tax assets net of million in valuation allowances and million of deferred tax liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities reported in the company s balance sheet reflect the amount of taxes that the company has prepaid or for which it will receive a tax benefit an asset or will have to pay in the future a liability because of temporary differences that result from differences in timing of revenue recognition or expense deductibility between generally accepted accounting principles and the internal revenue code 
accounting rules require that a deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
the need for a valuation allowance ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of a future deductible amount 
assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
the fact that a benefit may be expected for a portion but not all of a deferred tax asset increases the judgmental complexity of the determination 
projections of future taxable income  by their very nature  require estimates and judgments about future events that  although they might conceivably be predictable  are far less certain than events that have already occurred and can be objectively measured 
uncertainties that might exist with respect to the realization of the company s deferred tax assets relate to future taxable income 
see note for further discussion of the company s valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations and expenses estimating future benefit payments for purposes of measuring pension benefit obligations requires the company to make a number of assumptions about future experience 
these assumptions are combined with the terms of the company s plans to produce an estimate of required future benefit payments  which is discounted to reflect the time value of money 
as a result  assumptions about the covered population demographic assumptions and about the economic environment economic assumptions significantly affect pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the most significant demographic assumptions are expected retirement age  life expectancy  and turnover  while the key economic assumptions are the discount rate  the salary growth rate  and the expected return on plan assets 
the projected benefit obligation for the company s pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the company s other postretirement benefit plans was determined using a discount rate of at december   and at december  the assumed weighted average long term rate of compensation increase is 
the assumed weighted average long term rate of return on plan assets is 
plan assets consist principally of common stocks and us government and other fixed income obligations 
the estimated impact of a basis point decrease in the discount rate from to would increase the company s aggregate pension obligation by approximately million  while the estimated impact of a basis point increase in the discount rate from to would decrease the company s aggregate pension obligation by approximately million 
generally accepted accounting principles are applied to determine the expense that the company recognizes related to pension obligations  while pension plan funding is governed by tax and labor laws 
the company expects pension expense to be approximately million in  while cash contributions are expected to range from million to million in this compared to pension expense of million and cash contributions of million in at december   the company had million in accrued liabilities related to pension benefits 
this amount consists of an accrued liability of million reflecting the cumulative excess of the amount the company has 
table of contents expensed over the amount the company has funded since inception of its plans  as well as an additional minimum liability of million reflecting the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets 
see note for further discussion of the company s obligations related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
impairment of noncurrent assets the company reviews noncurrent assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is indicated if the total undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the assets  including the possible residual value associated with their eventual disposition  are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
assets are written down to fair value and a loss is recognized upon impairment 
fair value increases on assets previously written down for impairment losses are not recognized 
considerable judgment is exercised in the company s assessment of the need for an impairment write down 
indicators of impairment must be present 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
in some instances  situations might exist where impairments are the result of changes in economic conditions or other factors that develop over time  which increases the subjectivity of assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
a probability weighted approach is used for situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of long lived assets are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
new accounting standards see note for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their potential impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily under the scotia llc line of credit and the palco credit agreement  as well as certain other debt facilities used to finance real estate development activities 
these facilities bear interest at either the prime interest rate or libor plus a specified percentage point spread 
the scotia llc line of credit was established in conjunction with the offering of the timber notes 
the company s objective in maintaining its other variable rate borrowings is flexibility in borrowing funds and making repayments without penalties 
as of december   there were million in borrowings outstanding under all variable rate facilities 
based on the amount of borrowings outstanding under these facilities during  a change in interest rates effective from the beginning of the year would have resulted in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense of million 
all of the company s other debt is fixed rate  and therefore  does not expose the company to the risk of higher interest payments due to changes in market interest rates 
the company does not utilize interest rate swaps or similar hedging arrangements
