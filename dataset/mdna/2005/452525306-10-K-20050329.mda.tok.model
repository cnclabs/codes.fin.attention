item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal product sales for the year ended december  increased by  to  from  in  primarily due to growth in sales of first defense 
we believe that sales of our products are influenced by the price of milk sold by our primary customers 
after declining in to price levels common in the s  the price of milk has increased 
a common index used in the industry to measure this trend is known as the class iii milk price  which indicates the value of pounds of milk sold into the cheese market 
the average class iii milk price for was per pounds  which represents a increase from the average for the average class iii milk price for was 
we have generally held our product selling prices without increase 
sales of first defense increased by during the year ended december  in comparison to the same period in this increase was principally driven by higher sales volume rather than higher selling prices 
sales of first defense are normally seasonal with highest sales expected in the first quarter and lower sales expected during the summer months 
sales of wipe out dairy wipes decreased by during the twelve month period ended december  in comparison to the same period in sales of wipe out dairy wipes were first recorded in following the december acquisition of the product 
we believe the drop in sales in was largely due to the continued financial 
table of contents pressures that are forcing many small dairy producers out of business 
wipe out dairy wipes are more often used on small dairies than larger ones 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased by  to  from  in grant income decreased by  to  in  comprising of total revenues in and of total revenues in most of the grant income supported work on the development of mast out 
royalty income increased by  to  in the  in revenue that we recognized from the sale of technology rights in represents approximately of the  up front payment that pfizer made to us under a product development and marketing agreement that we entered into in december the balance of this payment was recorded as deferred revenue at december  and is expected to be recognized over the period ending december  in  we earned  in revenue from the sale of technology rights 
product costs amounted to of product sales in as compared to in internally developed products tend to have higher gross margin percentages than acquired products 
a moderately lower gross margin percentage is anticipated initially as new products are developed and acquired 
over time  as these products are fully integrated into our manufacturing and selling operations  we expect to be able to improve the gross margin percentage 
this is the case  for example  with wipe out dairy wipes  a product that we acquired in december in  we invested in the necessary facility addition and production equipment required to process the wipe stock and perform the filling operations for this product internally  which has caused an improvement in the gross margin 
in  we invested in the necessary facility modifications and production equipment required to produce nonpharmaceutical grade nisin internally 
we decreased our expenditures for research and development by approximately  to  in as compared to  in the higher costs in were due principally to the expenses incurred in connection with the experimental field trial of mast out that we completed with positive results in research and development expenses aggregated and of total revenues in and  respectively 
research and development expenses exceeded grant income by approximately  in and by  in these net research and development expenses decreased to of product sales in from of product sales in the majority of our research and development budget from through has been focused on the development of mast out 
we are obligated to supply product for us clinical trials of mast out in  and pfizer is responsible for most of the other product development expenses going forward 
product selling expenses decreased by approximately  to  in  aggregating of product sales in  compared to in we continue to leverage the efforts of our small sales force through veterinary distribution channels 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  to  in as compared to  in a portion of our general and administrative expenses reflects the necessary expenses associated with being a publicly held company 
interest income increased by approximately  to  in in comparison to due principally to the increased amount of invested funds and a moderate increase in interest rates in we have not incurred interest expense since we repaid our outstanding bank debt in may in  other income included the  payment earned through the sale of our interest in agricell  a non core joint venture 
income before income taxes of  for the year ended december  compares to  for the year ended december  principally due to other income earned in through the sale of our joint venture interest that was offset by the beneficial effects of increased revenues and decreased expenses in we recorded tax expense at an effective tax rate of and in and  respectively  resulting in net income of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax expense included deferred taxes of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  which consisted primarily of the utilization of prior year net operating loss carryforwards 
the 
table of contents income tax expense includes a tax benefit of approximately  due to a change in the valuation allowance pertaining to certain deferred tax assets 
fiscal compared to fiscal total product sales decreased by in in comparison to due principally to the termination of a product license effective as of october   as further discussed below 
the effect of the termination of this product license on the current period to period comparison of our performance is now behind us 
going forward as we compare the results for to  we will be looking at the results of our proprietary products 
sales of our proprietary products principally first defense and wipe out dairy wipes increased by in in comparison to we believe that sales of our products are influenced by the price of milk sold by our primary customers 
after declining in to price levels common in the s  the price of milk has recently begun to improve 
a common index used in the industry to measure this trend is known as the class iii milk price  which indicates the value of pounds of milk sold into the cheese market 
the average class iii milk price for was per pounds  which represents a increase from the average for the average class iii milk price for was 
this upward trend could have a positive impact on our sales if it continues in the future 
research and development expenses increased by in in comparison to due principally to the expenses incurred in connection with the experimental field trial of mast out that we completed with positive results 
the  in other income earned from the sale of a non core joint venture in the first quarter of enabled us to pay for this study and report a fifth consecutive profitable year in given the potential sales levels for mast out if it is successfully developed  manufactured and approved for sale by the fda  we believe the increased level of research and development spending is warranted 
total revenues for the year ended december  decreased by  to  from  in product sales for the year ended december  decreased by  to  from  in  primarily due to the termination of the license to market the kamar heatmount detector 
we have generally held our product selling prices without increase in consideration of the difficult economic times being experienced by our primary customers  dairy producers 
sales of first defense increased by during the year ended december  in comparison to the same period in sales have benefited from the withdrawal of a competitive product from the market and from a significant increase in the value of calves 
however  this positive effect was  in part  offset by negative pressures relating to a decline in milk prices 
the sales of first defense are normally seasonal with highest sales expected in the first quarter and lower sales expected during the summer months 
sales of wipe out dairy wipes decreased by during the twelve month period ended december  in comparison to the same period in sales of wipe out dairy wipes were first recorded in following the december acquisition of the product

royalty income increased by  to  in in  we earned  in revenue from the sale of technology rights 
in  revenue from the sale of technology rights included  earned upon the termination of a license covering certain of the diffgam technology rights   earned under this license before it was cancelled   from an option to the lactoferrin technology and  from a different license to the diffgam technology 
on october   we accepted a payment of  from kamar  inc of steamboat springs  colorado in consideration of the early termination of our rights to market the kamar heatmount detector 
since  the company had marketed kamar s product under an exclusive license that was set to expire on december  when we negotiated the receipt of  in return for its termination twenty seven months ahead of schedule

over time  as these products are fully integrated into our manufacturing and selling operations  we expect to be able to improve the gross margin percentage 
this is the case  for example  with wipe out dairy wipes  a product that we acquired in december in  we invested in the necessary facility addition and production equipment required to process the wipe stock and perform the filling operations for this product internally  which has caused an improvement in the gross margin 
we are now investing in the necessary facility modifications and production equipment required to produce nisin internally 
at this stage in our development  management is focusing on growing the absolute dollar value of the gross margin from the products that we continue to sell 
we increased our expenditures for research and development by approximately  to  in as compared to  in research and development expenses aggregated and of total revenues in and  respectively 
research and development expenses exceeded grant income by approximately  in and by  in these net research and development expenses increased to of product sales in from of product sales in since  we have shifted the primary focus of our research and development efforts to products for the animal health industry 
the majority of our research and development budget is focused on the development of mast out 
product selling expenses decreased by approximately  to  in  aggregating of product sales in  compared to in the decrease in the aggregate dollar amount of these expenses results principally from the october  termination of the license to market the kamar heatmount detector  a product that had comprised a significant percentage of total sales 
we continue to leverage the efforts of our small sales force through veterinary distribution channels 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  to  in as compared to  in we continue our efforts 
table of contents to control general and administrative expenses while incurring all the necessary expenses associated with being a publicly held company 
interest income increased by approximately  to  in in comparison to due principally to the increased amount of invested funds despite the low interest rate environment 
we did not incur interest expense after we repaid our outstanding bank debt in may in  other income included the  payment earned through the sale of our interest in a lactoferrin producing joint venture

income tax expense included deferred taxes of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  which consisted primarily of the utilization of prior year net operating loss carryforwards 
financial position  liquidity and capital resources we had approximately  in available cash and short term investments as of december  we are using some of this cash to fund product development and to invest in the manufacturing of our commercialized products 
we continue to look for new product acquisition opportunities that would have a strategic fit with the products that we currently sell 
under our december product development and marketing agreement with pfizer  we received an up front payment of  we are eligible to receive additional performance milestone payments and royalties on any sales of mast out made by pfizer 
pfizer is responsible for most of the future product development and all of the marketing expenses pertaining to mast out 
nisin for wipe out dairy wipes had been produced for us under subcontract since the product s acquisition in during  we began making building modifications and fixed asset acquisitions necessary to bring the production process in house 
as of december   approximately  had been paid to vendors on this project 
we completed this investment in july for a total cost of approximately  this facility is also being used to produce clinical material for mast out 
the know how gained in producing nisin in our facility is being transferred to pfizer  who is responsible for the production of cgmp nisin for mast out 
the table below summarizes the changes in selected key balance sheet items balance at december  increase cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net working capital total assets shareholders equity during  operating activities provided approximately  in cash 
the two largest operating activities that were added back to net income were depreciation and amortization expense of  and an increase in deferred revenue of  investing activities used  in cash  comprised of a  net investment in fixed assets  a net investment of  in short term investments and a  acquisition of product rights 
financing activities included approximately  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 

table of contents we funded our research and development expenses principally from product sales 
during the year ended december   gross margin of  from product sales was sufficient to fund the aggregate of  in research and development expenses net of grant income net r d and selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses  resulting in our sixth consecutive year of profitability 
in  the  in gross margin was not sufficient to fund the aggregate of  in net r d and s  g a expenses 
the resulting deficit was more than funded by the  in other income received from the sale of our interest in a lactoferrin producing joint venture  and as a result  we were able to record our fifth consecutive year of profitability 
in  the  in gross margin almost funded the aggregate of  in net r d and s  g a expenses 
in  the  gross margin more than funded the aggregate of  in net r d and s  g a expenses

in  the  gross margin more than funded the aggregate of  in net r d and s  g a expenses 
since  our strategy has been to focus our research and development efforts on animal health product opportunities  which are generally less expensive to develop than human health products 
in march  we received a two year award aggregating up to  from the maine technology institute  a non profit corporation created by the general assembly of the state of maine 
the award augmented our development of mast out 
the award was subject to a contingent payback obligation unless the product development was terminated 
because of this contingent payback obligation  the funding was recorded as deferred revenue as the cash was received  and no income was recognized to match the development expenses as they were incurred 
after pfizer assumed primary responsibility for the future development of mast out  we repaid this award in full in december our cumulative investment in research and development expenses of  for the fifteen year period ended december  has been supported  in part  by  in grant awards since we have been awarded seven phase i and three phase ii small business innovation research sbir grants from the national institutes of health aggregating  in addition  we have received three awards from the state of maine aggregating  two phase i sbir grants from the usda aggregating  and one  grant from the department of defense 
in addition to the  that supported the development of the company s milk antibody products for humans  approximately  was awarded in support of the mast out development program   was awarded in support of skin sanitizing applications of nisin   was awarded in support of crypto scan and  was awarded in support of new approaches to the diagnosis of johne s disease 
approximately  of this grant income was recognized prior to  and  was recognized in not including the  award from the maine technology institute  described above and  is expected to be recognized in we may  on occasion  seek additional research grant support as a means of leveraging the funds that we are able to spend developing new products 
forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of such statements include  but are not limited to  any statements relating to our objectives concerning future product sales  research and development expenses and anticipated timelines  profitability  expense ratios and any other statements that are not historical facts 
such statements involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those risks and uncertainties relating to difficulties or delays in development  testing  regulatory approval  production and marketing of our products  competition within our anticipated product markets  the uncertainties associated with product development  and other risks detailed from time to time in filings we make with the securities and exchange commission  including our annual report on form k and our quarterly reports on form q 
such statements are based on our current expectations  but actual results may differ materially due to various factors  including those risks and uncertainties mentioned or referred to in this annual report 

table of contents risk factors the sale and development of our products is subject to financial  efficacy  regulatory and market risks 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain the regulatory compliance required to continue selling our products or that we will be able to finance the development of new product opportunities or that  if financed  the new products will be found to be efficacious and gain the appropriate regulatory approval 
furthermore  if regulatory approval is obtained  there can be no assurance that the market estimates will prove to be accurate or that market acceptance at a profitable price level can be achieved or that the products can be profitably manufactured 
we are heavily dependent on the successful development of new products for future growth 
one such major effort is our arrangement with pfizer which will control the development and commercialization of mast out 
under our agreement  pfizer has broad discretion over the development efforts and retains the right to terminate the license subject to certain conditions 
we believe that supplies and raw materials for the production of our products are available from more than one source 
our policy is to maintain more than one source of supply for the components used in our products 
however  there is a risk that we could have difficulty in efficiently acquiring essential supplies 
we are dependent on our manufacturing operations and facility at evergreen drive in portland  maine for the production of first defense and wipe out dairy wipes 
any disruption in the services at this facility could negatively effect the production of inventory 
the dairy industry has been facing very difficult economic pressures 
many small farmers have been forced out of business 
during  milk prices declined to levels last experienced in the s 
while these conditions have recently improved  the financial insecurity of our primary customer base is a risk to our ability to maintain and grow sales at a profitable level 
first defense is sold in the united states subject to a product license approval from the usda first obtained in the potency of serial lots is directly traceable to the original serial used to obtain the product performance claims the reference standard 
due to the unique nature of the first defense label claims  host animal re testing is not required as long as periodic laboratory analyses continue to support the stability of stored reference standard 
to date  these analyses have demonstrated strong stability 
however  if  at any time  the usda does not approve the requalification of the reference standard  additional clinical studies could be required to meet regulatory requirements and allow for continued sales of the product 
the potential for epidemics of bovine diseases such as foot and mouth disease  bovine tuberculosis  brucellosis and bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse present a risk to us and our customers 
a documented case of bse in the us in has led to an overall tightening of regulations pertaining to ingredients of animal especially bovine origin 
for example  the fda has amended its animal feed rule to eliminate the exemption allowing mammalian blood and blood products to be fed to other ruminants as a protein source 
these actions  together with actions by the usda  to increase the levels of protection of the human food supply do not currently  and are not anticipated to  affect first defense 
first defense is considered a veterinary medicine rather than a feed ingredient  and it is manufactured from bovine milk and colostrums  which is not considered a bse risk material 
however  future regulations to minimize risk against the spread of disease could affect the regulatory status of first defense 
the threat of biological terrorism is a risk to both our ability to economically acquire and collect good quality raw material from our contract farms as well as to the economical health of our customers 
any act of widespread bioterrorism against the dairy industry could have a negative impact on our operations 
effects of inflation and interest rates  currency fluctuations we believe that neither inflation nor interest rates have had a significant effect on our revenues and expenses 
significant increases in inflation or interest rates  however  could affect our customers and the demand 
table of contents for our products 
we hope to increase the level of our future sales of products outside the united states  and the cost of our products to foreign customers could be affected by currency fluctuations 
critical accounting policies details regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements is provided in note m to our financial statements 
the financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards that were effective and applicable to us as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  intangible and long lived assets  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have chosen to highlight certain policies that we consider critical to the operations of the business and understanding our financial statements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
requires that four criteria are met before revenue is recognized 
these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment including to distributors for substantially all products  as title and risk of loss pass to the customer on delivery to the common carrier after concluding that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed 
royalty income is recorded on the accrual basis based on sales as reported to us by our licensee pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
non refundable grant income is recognized as reimbursable expenses are incurred 
indirect costs which are billed to the government are subject to their review 
all research and development costs and patent costs are expensed as incurred  except as described in the next paragraph 
in november  we capitalized a payment of approximately  made to nutrition  inc to buy out certain future milestone and royalty payment obligations  which principally resulted in a fully paid  perpetual license related to mast out 
this intangible asset is expected to be amortized over the period from november  to december  we received a  up front payment from pfizer in connection with the december product development and marketing agreement covering mast out 
we expect to recognize this revenue over the period from december  to december  both of these periods reflect management s estimate of the likely period of development before royalties could be received on sales of mast out 
the pfizer agreement  among other things  also provides for contingent milestone payments and royalties based on any future sales  subject to certain minimums 
we expect that revenue from any future milestone payments that we receive from pfizer will be recognized from the date that the milestone is achieved through december  any such milestone payments received for obtaining regulatory approvals  or after a regulatory approval is obtained  are expected to be recognized when the milestone has been reached 
should the december  estimate change  the period during which the then remaining expense and revenue are recognized would be adjusted accordingly 
any future royalty payments will be recognized as earned based on future product sales 
we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings that allow customers to earn cash rebates or future rights to free or discounted product 
we record product selling expenses for customer programs and incentive offerings that allow customers to earn promotional merchandise 
we estimate these expenses based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years 
distributors of first defense have the right to return expired product for a credit on future orders 
as the product has a two year shelf life  we have not experienced significant product returns historically 

table of contents inventories include raw materials  work in process and finished goods and are recorded at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost on the first in  first out method or market net realizable value 
work in process and finished goods inventories include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we utilized approximately   and  of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we have no remaining net operating loss carryforwards as of december  to offset future taxable income 
as a result of two consecutive years of profitable results in and and the expectation of continued profitability  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  in fiscal as a result of the release of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards 
the remaining valuation allowance related to the general business credit carryforward of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively  has not been released due to the uncertainty of its use before expiration 
this credit expires in the years through item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk none
