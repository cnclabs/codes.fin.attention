interest income continued to trend lower in fiscal  and due to lower levels of temporarily invested cash being held each year and lower interest rates in fiscal realized and unrealized losses on securities for fiscal included a  loss on marketable securities acquired in connection with the sale of tactica see note to our consolidated financial statements 
these marketable securities carry a restriction that prevents us from disposing of the stock prior to july   and are accordingly classified as stock available for sale

in fiscal  we recorded other income of  in connection with the settlement of litigation 
income tax expense our fiscal income tax expense was percent of net income before taxes  a rate substantially lower than the percent and percent rates that we experienced in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline was due to the continuing trend of more of our income in fiscal and being taxed in lower tax rate jurisdictions as non united states operations continue to become a larger portion of our business 
also  in fiscal we decreased our tax accruals by  due to the settlement reached with the united states internal revenue service for fiscal years through had these accruals not been adjusted  our income tax expense for fiscal would have been percent of net income before taxes 
discontinued operations as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  on april  we completed the sale of our percent interest in tactica back to certain shareholder operating managers 
in exchange for our percent share of tactica and the release of  of its secured debt and accrued interest owed to us  we received marketable securities  intellectual properties  and the right to certain tax refunds 
tactica was sold because we believed it no longer fit into our business model 
we believe selling tactica was the most appropriate course of action to maximize our long term shareholder value 
the sale freed key corporate managers to concentrate their efforts on our remaining core operating divisions and to explore and integrate new business opportunities better suited to our long term objectives and operating system

while at february  we had total indebtedness of  as of february  we had  in total indebtedness outstanding 
this increase in debt has added new constraints on our ability to operate our business  including but not limited to our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes  an increased portion of our cash flow from operations will be required to pay interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available to us for our operations  the new debt has been issued at variable rates of interest  which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates  our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions  our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and conditions in the industries in which we operate  the new debt agreements contain financial and restrictive covenants  and our failure to comply with them could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
significant restrictive covenants include limitations on among other things  our ability under certain circumstances to incur additional debt  including guarantees  incur certain types of liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  engage in mergers or consolidations  enter into substantial new lines of business  and enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates 
in connection with these financing transactions  we incurred  of financing costs 
these costs are being amortized over the related lives of the various notes financed  ranging from to years 
on september   certain of our subsidiaries entered into a  unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america to facilitate short term borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit 
all borrowings accrued interest equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus percent or bank of america s prime rate 
alternatively  upon our timely election  borrowings accrued interest based on the respective    or month libor rate plus percent based upon the term of the borrowing 
the credit facility allowed for the issuance of letters of credit up to  outstanding letters of credit reduced the  borrowing limit dollar for dollar 
the bank of america credit agreement required the maintenance of certain debt ebitda  fixed charge coverage ratios  and other customary covenants 
the agreement was guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by our parent company  helen of troy limited  and certain us subsidiaries 
the credit facility was cancelled on june  during fiscal and fiscal  we funded our activities with internally generated cash flow 
while we borrowed from time to time against certain revolving credit facilities  all borrowings were short term and repaid within months of the initial advances 
our most significant short term borrowing was the draw of  of cash to initially fund our september  acquisition of the brut brand 
as of fiscal year end  we used internally generated operating cash flow to pay off this advance 
during the second fiscal quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved a resolution to purchase  in open market or through private transactions  up to  shares of our common stock 
during fiscal  we purchased and retired a total of  shares of our common stock on the open market at a total purchase price of  an additional  shares of common stock were tendered by a key shareholder and retired as payment and satisfaction of  of stock purchase price and federal income tax obligations arising from the exercise of  options by a key employee shareholder 
this transaction was valued at an average share price of using the average of the high bid and low bid prices for helen of troy stock as reported on the nasdaq national market system on the day the stock was tendered 
during fiscal  we purchased and retired a total of  shares of our common stock on the open market at a total purchase price of  an additional  shares of common stock were tendered by a key shareholder and retired as payment and satisfaction of  of stock purchase price and federal income tax obligations arising from the exercise of  options by a key employee shareholder 
this transaction was valued at an average share price of using the average of the high bid and low bid prices for helen of troy stock as reported on the nasdaq national market system on the day the stock was tendered 
proceeds from employee option exercises and purchases through our employee stock purchase plan combined to provide  of cash and  in tax benefits in fiscal  and  of cash and  in tax benefits in fiscal contractual obligations our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  as of the end of fiscal were payments due by period ended the last day of february in thousands after contractual obligations total year years years years years years long term debt open purchase orders inventory minimum royalty payments advertising and promotional operating leases implementation of enterprise resource planning system other total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we have no existing activities involving special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing 
current and future capital needs based on our current financial condition and current operations  we believe that cash flows from operations and available financing sources will continue to provide sufficient capital resources to fund the company s foreseeable short and long term liquidity requirements 
we expect our capital needs to stem primarily from the need to purchase sufficient levels of inventory and to carry normal levels of accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
in addition  we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities on a regular basis and may augment our internal growth with acquisitions of complementary businesses or product lines 
we may finance acquisition activity with available cash  the issuance of stock  or with additional debt  depending upon the size and nature of any such transaction and the status of the capital markets at the time of such acquisition 
non monetary transactions during fiscal  we entered into two non monetary transactions in which we exchanged inventory with a net book value of approximately  for advertising credits 
during fiscal  we entered into additional non monetary transactions in which we exchanged inventory with a book value of approximately  for additional advertising credits 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded both sales and cost of goods sold equal to the exchanged inventory s net book value  which approximated their fair value 
we used approximately   and  of the advertising credits during fiscal  and  respectively 
as of february   all credits from the transaction had been utilized 
all remaining credits are valued at  and  on our consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal and  respectively  and are included in the line item entitled prepaid assets 
critical accounting policies the us securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we consider the following policies to meet this definition 
hong kong income taxes the inland revenue department the ird in hong kong has assessed a total of  us in tax on certain profits of our foreign subsidiaries for the fiscal years through hong kong taxes income earned from certain activities conducted in hong kong 
we are vigorously defending our position that we conducted the activities that produced the profits in question outside of hong kong 
we also assert that we have complied with all applicable reporting and tax payment obligations 
in connection with the ird s tax assessment for the fiscal years through  we were required to purchase  us in tax reserve certificates in hong kong 
during fiscal  we purchased additional tax reserve certificates in the amount of  us as required by the ird 
with the purchase of these certificates  we have purchased tax reserve certificates totaling  for fiscal years through tax reserve certificates represent the prepayment by a taxpayer of potential tax liabilities 
the amounts paid for tax reserve certificates are refundable in the event that the value of the tax reserve certificates exceeds the related tax liability 
these certificates are denominated in hong kong dollars and are subject to the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
if the ird s position were to prevail and if it were to assert the same position for fiscal years after fiscal year  the resulting assessment could total  us in taxes for fiscal year and we would vigorously disagree with the proposed adjustments and would aggressively contest this matter through applicable taxing authority and judicial procedures  as appropriate 
although the final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and involves unsettled areas of the law  based on currently available information  we have provided for our best estimate of the probable tax liability for this matter 
while the resolution of the issue may result in tax liabilities which are significantly higher or lower than the reserves established for this matter  management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity 
however  an unfavorable resolution could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the quarter in which an adjustment is recorded or the tax is due or paid 
income tax provisions we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as changes occur in our assessments regarding our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision is increased in any period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of other complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts are unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer probable 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
estimates of credits to be issued to customers we regularly receive requests for credits from retailers for returned products or in connection with sales incentives  such as cooperative advertising and volume rebate agreements 
we reduce sales or increase selling  general  and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the credits  for estimated future credits to customers 
our estimates of these amounts are based either on historical information about credits issued  relative to total sales  or on specific knowledge of incentives offered to retailers 
this process entails a significant amount of inherent subjectivity and uncertainty 
allowance for accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
that estimate is based on historical collection experience  current economic and market conditions  and a review of the current status of each customer s trade accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or our judgment regarding their financial condition was to change negatively  additional allowances may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if the financial condition of our customers were to improve or our judgment regarding their financial condition was to change positively  a reduction in the allowances may be required resulting in an increase in income in the period such determination was made 
valuation of inventory we consume our inventory stocks using a first in first out system 
we record inventory on our balance sheet based on the lower of its average cost or its net realizable value 
determination of net realizable value requires us to estimate the point in time at which an item s net realizable value drops below its cost 
we regularly review our inventory for slow moving items and for items that we are unable to sell at prices above their original cost 
when we identify such an item  we reduce its book value to the net amount that we expect to realize upon its sale 
this process entails a significant amount of inherent subjectivity and uncertainty 
carrying value of long lived assets we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in assessing the carrying values of our long lived assets 
sfas and sfas both require that we consider whether circumstances or conditions exist that suggest that the carrying value of a long lived asset might be impaired 
if such circumstances or conditions exist  further steps are required in order to determine whether the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
if analyses indicate that the asset s carrying value does exceed its fair market value  the next step is to record a loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
the steps required by sfas and sfas entail significant amounts of judgment and subjectivity 
in fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in connection with the discontinued operations of our tactica segment  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
no impairment charges were recorded in fiscal economic useful life of intangible assets we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in determining the useful economic lives of intangible assets that we acquire and that we report on our consolidated balance sheets 
sfas requires that we amortize intangible assets  such as licenses and trademarks  over their economic useful lives  unless those assets economic useful lives are indefinite 
if an intangible asset s economic useful life is deemed to be indefinite  that asset is not amortized 
when we acquire an intangible asset  we consider factors such as the asset s history  our plans for that asset  and the market for products associated with the asset 
we consider these same factors when reviewing the economic useful lives of our previously acquired intangible assets as well 
we review the economic useful lives of our intangible assets at least annually 
the determination of the economic useful life of an intangible asset requires a significant amount of judgment and entails significant subjectivity and uncertainty 
for a more comprehensive list of our accounting policies  we encourage you to read note summary of significant accounting policies  included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
note contains several other policies  including policies governing the timing of revenue recognition  that are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  but do not meet the sec s definition of critical accounting policies because they do not involve subjective or complex judgments 
forward looking information and factors that may affect future results certain written and oral statements made by our company and subsidiaries or with the approval of an authorized executive officer of our company may constitute forward looking statements as defined under the private securities litigation reform act of this includes statements made in this report  in other filings with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in certain other oral and written presentations 
generally  the words anticipates  believes  expects  plans  may  will  should  seeks  estimates  predict  potential  continue  intends  and other similar words identify forward looking statements 
all statements that address operating results  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements related to sales  earnings per share results  and statements expressing general expectations about future operating results  are forward looking statements 
the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to risks that could cause such statements to differ materially from actual results 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
risk factors we rely on key senior management to operate our business  the loss of any of these senior managers could have an adverse impact on our business 
we do not have a large group of senior executives in our business 
accordingly  we depend on a small number of key senior executives to run our business 
in particular  we rely heavily on the services of mr 
rubin  our chief executive officer and president 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our key senior executives 
the loss of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if we are unable to find  relocate and integrate adequate replacements for any of these persons 
further  in order to continue to grow our business  we will need to expand our key senior management team 
we may be unable to attract or retain these persons 
this could hinder our ability to grow our business and could disrupt our operations or materially adversely affect the success of our business 
we rely on our new global enterprise resource planning system  the failure of which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 
on september   we implemented our new global enterprise resource planning system  along with other new technologies 
with the implementation of this new system  most of our businesses with the significant exception of the newly acquired housewares segment run under one integrated information system 
we continue with the process of closely monitoring the new system and making normal and expected adjustments to improve its effectiveness 
complications resulting from the continuing process adjustments could potentially cause considerable disruptions to our business 
the change from the old system to the new system continues to involve risk 
application program bugs  system conflict crashes  user error  data integrity issues  customer data conflicts and integration issues with certain remaining legacy systems all pose potential risks 
implementing new data standards and converting existing data to accommodate the new system s requirements have required a significant effort across our entire organization 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we began the implementation and transition of our housewares segment to the new system 
we also are implementing several significant functionality enhancements 
these additional implementations will continue to strain our internal resources  could impact our ability to do business  and may result in higher implementation costs and concurrent reallocation of human resources 
to support these new technologies  we are building and supporting a much larger and more complex information technology infrastructure 
increased computing capacity  power requirements  back up capacities  broadband network infrastructure and increased security needs are all potential areas for failure and risk 
we continue to rely substantially on outside vendors to assist us with implementation and enhancements and will continue to rely on certain vendors to assist us in maintaining some of our new infrastructure 
should they fail to perform due to events outside our control  it could affect our service levels and threaten our ability to conduct business 
over time  we plan to transition many of these third party services to our in house staff and continue with significant training efforts in order to do so 
the transition from third party services to in house staffing of such services poses risks that could cause additional business disruptions 
finally  natural disasters may disrupt our infrastructure and our disaster recovery process may not be sufficient to protect against loss 
our business operations are dependent on our logistical systems  which include our order management system and our computerized warehouse network 
these logistical systems depend on our new global enterprise resource planning system 
any interruption in our logistical systems would impact our ability to procure our products from our factories and suppliers  transport them to our distribution facilities  store them and deliver them to our customers on time and in the correct amounts 
acquisitions and partnerships may be more costly or less profitable than anticipated and may adversely affect the price of our company stock 
as previously mentioned  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of oxo international on june  on september   we acquired certain assets related to the worldwide production and distribution of timeblock and skin milk body and skin care products lines from naterra international  inc timeblock is a line of clinically tested anti aging skin care products 
skin milk is a line of body  bath and skin care products enriched with real milk proteins  vitamins and botanical extracts 
to the extent that these acquisitions are not favorably received by consumers  shareholders  analysts  and others in the investment community  the price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel associated with the acquisitions  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees associated with the acquisitions 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the operations  technologies  products  or personnel that we have acquired  our business  results of operations  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our sales are dependent on sales from several large customers and the loss of  or substantial decline in sales to  a top customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
a few customers account for a substantial percentage of our sales 
our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if we lost all or a portion of the sales to these customers 
in particular  sales to wal mart stores  inc  and its affiliate  sam s club  accounted for approximately percent of our net sales in fiscal while no other customer accounted for ten percent or more of net sales  our top customers accounted for approximately percent of fiscal net sales 
although we have long standing relationships with our major customers  no contracts require these customers to buy from us  or to purchase a minimum amount of our products 
a substantial decrease in sales to any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our projections of sales and earnings are highly subjective and our future sales and earnings could vary in a material amount from our projections 
most of our major customers purchase our products electronically through electronic data interchange and expect us to promptly deliver products from our existing inventories to the customers retail stores or distribution centers 
this method of ordering products allows our customers to immediately respond to changes in demands of their retail customers 
from time to time  we provide projections to our shareholders and the investment community of our future sales and earnings 
since we do not have long term purchase commitments from our major customers and the customer order and ship process is short  it is difficult for us to accurately predict the amount of our sales and related earnings 
our projections are based on management s best estimate of sales using historical sales data and other information deemed relevant 
these projections are highly subjective since sales to our customers can fluctuate substantially based on the demands of their retail customers 
additionally  changes in retailer inventory management strategies could make inventory management more difficult 
because our ability to forecast sales is highly subjective  there is a risk that our future sales and earnings could vary materially from our projections 
we are dependent on third party manufacturers  most of which are located in the far east and any inability to obtain products from such manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated companies  most of which are in the far east 
risks associated with such foreign manufacturing include changing international political relations  changes in laws  including tax laws  regulations and treaties  changes in labor laws  regulations  and policies  changes in customs duties and other trade barriers  changes in shipping costs  currency exchange fluctuations  local political unrest  an extended and complex transportation cycle  and the availability and cost of raw materials and merchandise 
to date  these factors have not significantly affected our production in the far east 
however  any change that impairs our ability to obtain products from such manufacturers  or to obtain products at marketable rates  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
with most of our manufacturers located in the far east  our production lead times are relatively long 
therefore  we must commit to production in advance of customer orders 
if we fail to forecast customer or consumer demand accurately  we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventories  or may find that customers are canceling orders or returning products 
distribution difficulties may have an adverse effect on our business by increasing the amount of inventory and the cost of storing inventory 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have incurred substantial debt to fund acquisitions which could have an adverse impact on our business and profitability 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred substantial debt as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements and under the financing activities section of our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we are now operating under substantially more leverage and have begun to incur higher interest costs 
this substantial increase in debt has added new constraints on our ability to operate our business  including but not limited to our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes  or other purposes  an increased portion of our cash flow from operations will be required to pay interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available to us for our operations  the new debt has been issued at variable rates of interest  which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates  our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions  our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and conditions in the industries in which we operate  the new debt agreements contain financial and restrictive covenants  and our failure to comply with them could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
significant restrictive covenants include limitations on among other things  our ability under certain circumstances to incur additional debt  including guarantees  incur certain types of liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  engage in mergers or consolidations  enter into substantial new lines of business  enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates 
our disagreements with taxing authorities  tax compliance and the impact of changes in tax law could have an adverse impact on our business 
hong kong income taxes the inland revenue department the ird in hong kong has assessed a total of  us in tax on certain profits of our foreign subsidiaries for the fiscal years through hong kong taxes income earned from certain activities conducted in hong kong 
we are vigorously defending our position that we conducted the activities that produced the profits in question outside of hong kong 
we also assert that we have complied with all applicable reporting and tax payment obligations 
in connection with the ird s tax assessment for the fiscal years through  we were required to purchase  us in tax reserve certificates in hong kong 
during fiscal  we purchased additional tax reserve certificates in the amount of  us as required by the ird 
with the purchase of these certificates  we have purchased tax reserve certificates totaling  for fiscal years through tax reserve certificates represent the prepayment by a taxpayer of potential tax liabilities 
the amounts paid for tax reserve certificates are refundable in the event that the value of the tax reserve certificates exceeds the related tax liability 
these certificates are denominated in hong kong dollars and are subject to the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
if the ird s position were to prevail and if it were to assert the same position for fiscal years after fiscal year  the resulting assessment could total  us in taxes for fiscal years and we would vigorously disagree with the proposed adjustments and would aggressively contest this matter through applicable taxing authority and judicial procedures  as appropriate 
although the final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and involves unsettled areas of the law  based on currently available information  we have provided for our best estimate of the probable tax liability for this matter 
while the resolution of the issue may result in tax liabilities which are significantly higher or lower than the reserves established for this matter  management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity 
however  an unfavorable resolution could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the quarter in which an adjustment is recorded or the tax is due or paid 
united states income taxes the internal revenue service the irs has completed its audits of the us consolidated federal tax returns for fiscal years  and we previously disclosed that the irs provided notice of proposed adjustments to taxes of approximately  for the three years under audit 
we have resolved the various tax issues and reached an agreement on additional tax in the amount of  the resulting tax liability had already been provided for in our tax reserves and we have decreased our tax accruals related to the irs audits for fiscal years  and  accordingly 
this additional tax liability will be settled with funds already on deposit with the irs 
the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law by the president on october  the ajca creates a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the united states by providing an percent dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
according to the ajca  the amount of eligible repatriation is limited to million or the amount described as permanently reinvested earnings outside the united states in the most recent audited financial statements filed with the securities and exchange commission on or before june  whether the company will ultimately take advantage of the provision depends on a number of factors including potential forthcoming congressional actions  treasury regulations and development of a qualified reinvestment plan 
at this time  we have not made any changes to our existing position on reinvestment of foreign earnings subject to the ajca 
our position is that we will permanently reinvest all of the undistributed earnings of the non us subsidiaries of certain non us subsidiaries  and accordingly have made no provision for us federal income taxes on these undistributed earnings 
at february   undistributed earnings for which we had not provided deferred us federal income taxes totaled  compliance with and changes in tax law the future impact of tax legislation  regulations or treaties  including any future legislation in the united states or abroad that would affect the companies or subsidiaries that comprise our consolidated group is always uncertain 
our ability to respond to such changes so that we maintain favorable tax treatment  the cost and complexity of such compliance  and its impact on our ability to operate in jurisdictions flexibly always poses a risk 
in addition  because our parent company is a foreign corporation  we incur risks associated with our ability to avoid classification of our parent company as a controlled foreign corporation 
in order for us to preserve our current tax treatment of our non us earnings  it is critical we avoid controlled foreign corporation status 
a controlled foreign corporation is a non us corporation whose largest non us shareholders non us  those owning percent or more of its stock together own more than percent of the stock in such corporation 
if a change of ownership of the company were to occur such that the parent company became a controlled foreign corporation  such a change could have a material negative effect on the largest us shareholders and  in turn  on the company s business 
we materially rely on licensed trademarks  the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
we are materially dependent on our licensed trademarks as a substantial portion of our sales revenue comes from selling products under licensed trademarks 
as a result  we are materially dependent upon the continued use of such trademarks  particularly the vidal sassoon and revlon trademarks 
actions taken by licensors and other third parties could diminish greatly the value of any of our licensed trademarks 
if we were unable to sell products under these licensed trademarks or the value of the trademarks were diminished by the licensor due to their continuing long term financial capability to perform under the terms of the agreements or other reasons  or due to the actions of third parties  the effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations could be both negative and material 
in our housewares segment  we rely on a third party to provide certain warehousing  order fulfillment and shipment services 
any inability of the third party to continue to provide us these services until such time as we can effectively transfer these operations to our own warehouse facilities  or problems encountered during the transition to our own warehouse facilities  could have an adverse affect on the company s revenues and profitability and impair this segment s business 
on june  the company announced that  indirectly through its subsidiary helen of troy limited barbados  the company had completed its acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of oxo from world kitchen ghc  llc  wki holding company  inc and world kitchen  inc 
collectively  seller for approximately million plus the assumption of certain liabilities 
in connection with this acquisition  seller agreed to perform certain transitional services for the company until march   including  the warehousing  order fulfillment and shipment of oxo products 
seller and the company agreed to extend the period of these services until february  the company is in the process of planning the transition of the warehousing  order fulfillment and shipment services from seller to company on or before february  this transition includes  the building of a new  square foot warehouse facility in mississippi that was announced by the company and the construction of which will begin in may  acquiring and installing new state of the art warehouse equipment and systems  transitioning the warehousing  order fulfillment and shipment processes for the oxo products to our new global enterprise resource planning system  the physical moving of the existing oxo inventory from sellers current warehouse facility in illinois to mississippi  and testing and successful implementation of the new warehouse facility and systems 
any delays in construction of the new warehouse facility or problems encountered in connection with any of the foregoing requirements for transitioning the warehousing  order fulfillment and shipment services could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to fill orders for oxo products which could adversely affect the company s revenues and profitability and impair the oxo business 
new accounting guidance in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of this statement will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  for which the measurement and recognition provisions were to be effective for reporting periods beginning after june  however  in september  the eitf issued fasb staff position eitf issue no 
 effective date of paragraphs of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which postponed the measurement and recognition provisions of eitf  but maintained the disclosure requirements for all investments within the scope of the guidance to be effective in annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after june  eitf provides a three step process for determining whether investments  including equity securities  are other than temporarily impaired and requires additional disclosures in annual financial statements 
an investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
eitf outlines that an impairment would be considered other than temporary unless a the investor has the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of the fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment  and b evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
in addition  the severity and duration of the impairment should also be considered in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary 
we have applied the guidance provided by eitf and determined that certain recent declines in the market value of securities acquired in connection with the sale of tactica  as discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements were other than temporary  and recorded the appropriate recognition of a loss in our fiscal operating results 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter fas 
fas clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of fas are effective for fiscal years beginning june  or later 
management is currently evaluating the provisions of fas and does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions for example  stock options and awards of restricted stock in which an employer receives employee services in exchange for equity securities of the company or other rights to receive future compensation that are based on the fair value of the company s equity securities 
the statement eliminates the use of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recording compensation expense rather than an optional pro forma disclosure of what expense amounts might be 
the provisions of sfas r are effective for public companies at the beginning of their first annual period beginning after june  we expect to adopt sfas no 
r on march  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
r for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have an insignificant impact on our overall financial position 
at february   we had  options available for issue under our employee stock option plan  and  options available for issue under our non employee director s stock option plan 
the director s stock option plan is set to terminate in june  so effectively  we plan to issue only  options under this plan 
based upon our analysis of our current stock option plans in place  and assuming no further modifications to these plans  the estimated impact of adopting sfas no 
r for fiscal fiscal year of adoption will be to add approximately  net of tax benefits  to our annual operating expense 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american job creation act of fsp no 
amends the existing accounting literature that requires companies to record deferred taxes on foreign earnings  unless they intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings outside the us this pronouncement temporarily allows companies that are evaluating whether to repatriate foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of to delay recognizing any related taxes until that decision is made 
this pronouncement also requires companies that are considering repatriating earnings to disclose the status of their evaluation and the potential amounts being considered for repatriation 
the us treasury department has not issued final guidelines for applying the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act 
we continue to evaluate this legislation and fsp no 
to determine whether we will repatriate any foreign earnings and the impact  if any  that this pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates represent our primary financial market risks 
fluctuation in interest rates causes variation in the amount of interest that we can earn on our available cash and the amount of interest expense we incur on our short term and long term borrowings 
interest on our long term debt outstanding as of february  is both floating and fixed 
fixed rates are in place on  senior notes at rates ranging from percent to percent 
floating rates are in place on  of senior notes 
interest rates on these notes are reset quarterly based on the month libor rate plus basis points for the five and seven year notes  and the month libor rate plus basis points for the ten year notes 
interest rates during the latest fiscal year on these notes ranged from to percent for the five and seven year notes  and to percent for the ten year notes 
on march   the interest rates on these notes were reset for the next three months at percent for the five and seven year notes and percent for the ten year notes 
increases in interest rates expose us to risk on this debt 
also  with respect to our  senior notes  as interest rates drop below the rates on this debt  our interest cost can exceed the cost of capital of companies who borrow at lower rates of interest 
as mentioned in financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources  interest rates on our revolving credit agreement vary based on the higher of the federal funds rate percent or bank of america s prime rate  or alternatively at our election  the libor rate and the period we lock libor in for 
therefore  the potential for interest rate increases exposes us to interest rate risk on our revolving credit agreement 
our revolving credit agreement allows for maximum revolving borrowings of  at the end of fiscal  there were no outstanding borrowings and  of open letters of credit under this credit agreement 
the need to borrow under this agreement could ultimately subject us to higher interest rates  thus increasing the future cost of such debt 
we do not currently hedge against interest rate risk 
as mentioned under notes and to our consolidated financial statements  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources  and forward looking information and factors that may affect future results  on june   we established a new five year   revolving credit facility  cancelled our existing  revolving credit facility  and placed  of floating rate senior debt with five  seven  and ten year maturities 
both the new revolving credit facility and the senior debt bear floating rates of interest 
for example  a percent increase in our base interest rates could impact us by adding up to  of additional interest cost annually 
the addition of this level of debt exposure to our consolidated operations  and the uncertainty regarding the level of our future interest rates  substantially increases our risk profile 
because we purchase a majority of our inventory using us dollars  we are subject to minimal short term foreign exchange rate risk in purchasing inventory 
however long term declines in the value of the us dollar could subject us to higher inventory costs 
such an increase in inventory costs could occur if foreign vendors were to react to such a decline by raising prices 
sales in the united states are transacted in us dollars 
the majority of our sales in the united kingdom are transacted in british pounds  in france and germany are transacted in euros  in canada are transacted in canadian dollars and in mexico are transacted in pesos 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact sales  we are exposed to foreign exchange losses on those sales because our foreign currency sales prices are not adjusted for currency fluctuations 
when the us dollar weakens against those currencies  we could realize foreign currency gains 
our net sales denominated originally in currencies other than the us dollar totaled approximately   and  during the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we incurred a foreign currency exchange loss of  we incurred foreign currency exchange gains totaling  and  for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
we hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into a series of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange risk inherent in our forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
for transactions designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in the fair value arising from the change in the spot rates from period to period is deferred in other comprehensive income 
these amounts are subsequently recognized in selling  general  and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income in the same period as the forecasted transactions close out over the remaining balance of their terms 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value arising from the change in the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate is recognized in the period it occurred 
these amounts are also recognized in selling  general  and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 
we do not enter into any forward exchange contracts or similar instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the following table summarizes the various forward contracts we designated as cash flow hedges that were open at the end of fiscal and february  weighted average market value weighted forward rate of the spot rate at spot rate at average at contract in contract currency notional contract range of maturities contract february  forward rate february  us dollars type to deliver amount date from to date at inception thousands sell pounds  sell pounds  sell pounds  sell euros  february  weighted average market value weighted forward rate of the spot rate at spot rate at average at contract in contract currency notional contract range of maturities contract february  forward rate february  us dollars type to deliver amount date from to date at inception thousands sell pounds  sell pounds  sell euros  our cash flow hedges  while executed in order to minimize our foreign currency exchange rate risk  do subject us to fair value fluctuations on the underlying contracts 
the following table shows the potential fair value gain or loss in us dollars that would arise from a hypothetical percent change as of february  in each hedged currency s forward rate 
change in fair value due to a movement in forward rates in thousands favorable unfavorable british pound hedges euro hedges this table is for risk analysis purposes and does not purport to represent actual losses or gains in fair value that we will incur 
it is important to note that the change in value represents the estimated change in the fair value of the contracts 
because the contracts hedge an underlying exposure  we would expect a similar and opposite change in foreign exchange gains or losses over the same period as the contract 
we expect that as currency market conditions warrant  and our foreign denominated transaction exposure grows  we will continue to execute additional contracts in order to hedge against potential foreign exchange losses
