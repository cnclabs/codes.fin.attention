item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain line items from our consolidated statements of operations stated as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  revenue product sales contract revenue royalties total revenue costs and expenses cost of product sales cost of contract revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses loss from operations interest income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss product sales product sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware and software products 
hardware products include adsl test and development systems  modules  and modems 
software products consist of standard off the shelf software products for biometric  medical imaging and digital imaging applications  as well as dsl test and diagnostics software 
product sales increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  product sales decreased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily due to a million increase in revenue from the sale of software products  which was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue from the sale of hardware products 
product sales decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  product sales increased from in to in the dollar decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in revenue from the sale of software products  which was partially offset by a million increase in revenue from the sale of hardware products 
contract revenue contract revenue consists primarily of license and engineering service fees that we receive under agreements with our customers to develop adsl including adsl  adslplus or vdsl chipsets 
contract revenue increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  contract revenue increased from in to in the dollar increase in was from new agreements with existing customers and new customers 
contract revenue decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  contract revenue decreased from in to in the dollar decrease in contract revenue in was a result of a difficult environment for licensing intellectual property for communications integrated circuits 
both existing and prospective adsl chipset licensees were reluctant to begin new development projects given i generally weak worldwide economic conditions  ii a difficult and uncertain environment in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries  and iii intense adsl chipset competition and falling chipset prices 
during the last several years  customers and potential customers cautiously evaluated new chipset projects or delayed or cancelled projects in the face of such conditions 
royalties royalties consist of royalty payments that we receive under licensing agreements 
we receive royalties from customers for the right to use our technology in their chipsets or solutions 
royalties increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  royalties decreased from in to in the dollar increase in royalties was due to a million increase in adsl royalties and a million increase in biometrics and medical imaging royalties 
royalties increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  royalties increased from in to in the dollar increase was due to an increase in adsl royalties 
our royalty revenue comes predominantly from adsl chipset sales by analog devices  inc adi  and infineon technologies ag infineon 
despite steady growth of worldwide adsl subscribers over the last several years  the availability of adsl chipsets from a number of suppliers and intense competition among those suppliers has caused chipset prices to steadily decline 
we are uncertain how quickly sales of our customers chipsets will increase and whether such increases will contribute meaningful royalties to us 
cost of product sales since the cost of software product sales is minimal  cost of product sales consists primarily of the cost of hardware product sales 
cost of product sales decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of product sales  cost of product sales decreased from in to in cost of product sales decreased in due to a decrease in hardware product sales 
the increase in overall product margins was due to a larger proportion of software sales in the product sales revenue mix 
cost of product sales was essentially the same at million in and as a percentage of product sales  cost of product sales increased from in to in although cost of product sales was essentially unchanged during and  there were two offsetting factors that caused this result 
cost of product sales increased in primarily due to an increase in adsl module sales  which was offset by a decrease in cost of product sales that was primarily due to lower sales of adsl test and development systems 
the decline in overall product margins was primarily due to a smaller proportion of software sales in the product sales revenue mix 
cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue consists primarily of salaries for engineers and expenses for consultants  technology licensing fees  recruiting  supplies  equipment  depreciation and facilities associated with customer development projects 
our total engineering costs are allocated between cost of contract revenue and research and development expense 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between cost of contract revenue and research and development is a function of the level of effort expended on each 
cost of contract revenue increased from million in to million in as a percentage of contract revenue  cost of contract revenue decreased from in to in the dollar increase in cost of contract revenue was due to more customer contracts and higher contract revenue in as compared to cost of contract revenue decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of contract revenue  cost of contract revenue decreased from in to in the dollar decrease in cost of contract revenue was due to fewer customer contracts and lower contract revenue in as compared to research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of salaries for engineers and expenses for consultants  recruiting  supplies  equipment  depreciation and facilities related to engineering projects to improve our broadband intellectual property offerings  as well as our software and hardware product technology 
research and development expense decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expense decreased from in to in the dollar decrease was primarily from million decreased spending resulting from a shift of engineers to customer projects  where spending is classified as cost of contract revenue 
this shift occurred because we had more customer projects in than in the dollar decrease in spending was also attributable to million lower compensation and fringe benefit costs and million lower depreciation expense 
our research and development spending was principally focused on improving our adsl  adsl and adslplus stratiphy tm technology and chips  developing vdsl technology and chips  developing test and diagnostics hardware and software and developing imaging and biometrics software 
research and development expense decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expense increased from in to in the dollar decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately million per quarter in salaries and related expenses due to the reduction in force we implemented in october and salary reductions we imposed on january  this was partially offset by increased spending resulting from a shift of engineers from customer projects  where spending is classified as cost of contract revenue  to internal research and development projects  where spending is classified as research and development expense 
this shift occurred because we had fewer customer projects in than in  and we changed our technology offering such that it requires less engineering support 
in october  we terminated employees to reduce our operating costs 
of the employees who were terminated  were engineers 
the cost of severance and other employee benefits for terminated employees was approximately million 
the cost was recorded in the fourth quarter of  and it approximated our historical quarterly costs for these employees as if they were active employees 
therefore  the reduction in force had a minimal effect on research and development spending in as of december   accrued severance costs were approximately million  and were paid in the first half of in connection with the october reduction in force  we informed remaining employees that effective january  their salaries would be reduced by and that senior management s salaries would be reduced by 
this reduction in force and salary reduction lowered total engineering expenses by million  and lowered total company expenses by million 
total engineering expenses include cost of contract revenue and research and development expense 
selling and marketing expense selling and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries for sales and marketing personnel  travel  advertising and promotion  recruiting  and facilities expense 
sales and marketing expense was approximately million in both and as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expense decreased from in to in the percentage decrease was primarily due to higher revenue in as compared to sales and marketing expense decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expense increased from in to in the dollar decrease was primarily due to million lower spending on compensation and fringe benefit costs 
of this amount  approximately million was related to the reduction in force and salary reductions we implemented in october and january  respectively 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries for administrative personnel  facility costs  bad debt  audit  legal  stock exchange and insurance expenses 
general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense decreased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily due to a million lower provision for bad debts in compared with  and a million increase in professional fees and insurance 
these increases were reduced by a million decrease in depreciation expense 
general and administrative expense decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense decreased from in to in the dollar decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in our provisions for bad debts and million lower professional fees and insurance  as well as the reduction in force and salary reductions we implemented in october and january  respectively 
the reduction in force and salary reductions lowered general and administrative expenses by approximately million in interest income interest income decreased or  in and was approximately million in both and the dollar decrease was primarily due to lower cash balances 
interest income decreased from million in to million in the dollar decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our cash balances and lower cash balances 
income taxes we evaluate  on a quarterly basis  the positive and negative evidence affecting the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
as a result of incurring operating losses since  we determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets may not be realized  and since the fourth quarter of have established a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have not recorded a deferred tax benefit for the operating losses incurred in the years ended december  and in  we determined that due to our continuing operating losses in and as well as the uncertainty of the timing of profitability in future periods  we should fully reserve our deferred tax assets 
as a result  we recorded a tax provision of million in to reserve for our remaining deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss and research and experimentation credit carry forwards of approximately million and million respectively  which may be available to offset future federal income tax liabilities and expire at various dates through in addition  at december   we had approximately million and million of state net operating losses and state research and development and investment tax carry forwards  respectively  which expire at various dates through of the total net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards for which a valuation allowance was recorded  approximately million is attributable to the exercise of stock options and the tax benefit will be credited to additional paid in capital  if realized in the future 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in march  we have financed our activities primarily through the sale of stock 
in the years ended december   and  we received net proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of million  million and million  respectively 
our operating activities used net cash of million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in our operating activities was primarily the result of operating losses and working capital requirements 
in the years ended december    and  we made capital expenditures of million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in all three years primarily consisted of spending on computer hardware and software  laboratory equipment  and furniture used principally in engineering activities 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and investments of million 
while we can not assure you that we will not require additional financing  or that such financing will be available to us  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity 
the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases purchase orders total critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  income taxes and the allowance for doubtful accounts to be critical policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from three sources i product revenue  which includes revenue from the sale of hardware and software products for the automated test equipment market and software products for the biometrics  medical and digital imaging markets  ii contract revenue  which includes patent  license and engineering service fees that we receive under customer agreements  and iii royalties that we receive under customer agreements 
as prescribed by securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we also apply the principles set forth in aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  when recognizing software revenue 
our revenue recognition policies are described more fully in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as described below  we make significant judgments and estimates during the process of determining revenue for any particular accounting period 
in determining revenue recognition  we assess whether fees associated with revenue transactions are fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we make a judgment whether fees are fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with that transaction 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured 
in addition to these general revenue recognition judgments  we make specific judgments and estimates with respect to the recognition of contract revenue 
when our agreements include the delivery of licensing rights and technology as well as the provision of engineering services  we combine the total patent  license and engineering service fees to be paid under the agreement 
these total fees are recognized ratably over the expected product development period  subject to the limitation that the cumulative revenue recognized through the end of any period may not exceed cumulative contract payments to date 
we review assumptions regarding the product development period on a regular basis and make adjustments as required 
consistent with the principles of sab  we believe that this method represents the appropriate systematic method for revenue recognition for this type of contract 
after customers enter into development and license agreements  they often engage us to provide additional engineering work that is beyond the scope of their original agreement 
when customers request additional services  both parties agree to engineering fees that are based on the level of effort required 
we recognize revenue from these agreements either as engineering services are performed or as milestones are achieved 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our actual current tax expense 
we must also estimate temporary and permanent differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period for deferred tax assets  which have been recognized  we must include an expense with the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets relate to net operating losses and research and development tax credits that we are carrying forward into future tax periods 
as of december   we had a total of million of deferred tax assets for which we had recorded a full valuation allowance 
of the total valuation allowance  approximately million relates to net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards that are attributable to the exercise of stock options and the tax benefit will be credited to additional paid in capital  if realized in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
if the judgments we make to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision to sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render service 
the effective date of sfas r is as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas r to impact our overall financial position 
factors that may affect future results some of the information in this form k contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  continue and similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future operating results or financial condition  or state other forward looking information 
however  we may not be able to predict future events accurately 
the risk factors listed in this section  as well as any cautionary language in this form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this form k could materially and adversely affect our business 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
our quarterly results are unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
because our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict  and our expenses are largely independent of revenues in any particular period  it is difficult for us to accurately forecast revenues and profitability 
when appropriate  we recognize contract revenues ratably over the period during which we expect to deliver technology and provide engineering services 
while this means that contract revenues from certain current agreements are generally predictable  changes can be introduced by a reevaluation of the length of the development period  or by the termination of a contract 
the initial estimate of this period is subject to revision as the product being developed under a contract nears completion  and a revision may result in an increase or decrease to the quarterly revenue for that contract 
in addition  accurate prediction of revenues from new contracts or licensees is difficult because contract negotiation is a lengthy process  frequently spanning a year or more  and the fiscal period in which a new license agreement will be entered into  if at all  and the financial terms of such an agreement are difficult to predict 
contract revenues also include fees for engineering services  which are dependent upon the varying level of assistance desired by licensees and  therefore  the revenue from these services is also difficult to predict 
it is also difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of royalty revenues 
royalties are recognized in the quarter in which we receive a report from a licensee regarding the shipment of licensed integrated circuits in the prior quarter  and are dependent upon fluctuating sales volumes and or prices of chips containing our technology  all of which are beyond our ability to control or assess in advance 
our business is subject to a variety of additional risks  which could materially adversely affect quarterly and annual operating results  including x market acceptance of broadband technologies we supply by semiconductor or equipment companies  x the extent and timing of new license transactions with semiconductor companies  x changes in our and our licensees development schedules and levels of expenditure on research and development  x the loss of a strategic relationship or termination of a project by a licensee  x equipment companies acceptance of integrated circuits produced by our licensees  x the loss by a licensee of a strategic relationship with an equipment company customer  x announcements or introductions of new technologies or products by us or our competitors  x delays or problems in the introduction or performance of enhancements or of future generations of our technology  x failures or problems in our hardware or software products  x delays in the adoption of new industry standards or changes in market perception of the value of new or existing standards  x competitive pressures resulting in lower contract revenues or royalty rates  x competitive pressures resulting in lower software or hardware product revenues  x personnel changes  particularly those involving engineering and technical personnel  x costs associated with protecting our intellectual property  x the potential that licensees could fail to make payments under their current contracts  x adsl market related issues  including lower adsl chipset unit demand brought on by excess channel inventory and lower average selling prices for adsl chipsets as a result of market surpluses  x regulatory developments  and x general economic trends and other factors 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenue levels and operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on our quarterly revenue and operating results to predict our future performance 
we experienced net losses we had a net loss during    and we may continue to experience losses in the future if x the semiconductor and telecommunications markets do not improve  x our existing customers do not increase their revenues from sales of chipsets with our technology  x new or existing customers do not choose to license our intellectual property for new chipset products  or x new or existing customers do not choose to use our software or hardware products 
we have a unique business model the success of our business model depends upon our ability to license our technology to semiconductor and equipment companies  and our customers willingness and ability to sell products that incorporate our technology so that we may receive significant royalties that are consistent with our plans and expectations 
we face numerous risks in successfully obtaining suitable licensees on terms consistent with our business model  including  among others x we must typically undergo a lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with a potential licensee before there is any assurance of a license agreement with such party  x we must persuade semiconductor and equipment manufacturers with significant resources to rely on us for critical technology on an ongoing basis rather than trying to develop similar technology internally  x we must persuade potential licensees to bear development costs associated with our technology applications and to make the necessary investment to successfully manufacture chipsets and products using our technology  and x we must successfully transfer technical know how to licensees 
moreover  the success of our business model also depends on the receipt of royalties from licensees 
royalties from our licensees are often based on the selling prices of our licensees chipsets and products  over which we have little or no control 
we also have little or no control over our licensees promotional and marketing efforts 
they are not prohibited from competing against us 
our business could be seriously harmed if x we cannot obtain suitable licensees  x our licensees fail to achieve significant sales of chipsets or products incorporating our technology  or x we otherwise fail to implement our business strategy successfully 
there has been and may continue to be an oversupply of adsl chipsets  and there is intense competition for adsl chipsets  which has caused our royalty revenue to decline the royalties we receive are influenced by many of the risks faced by the adsl market in general  including reduced average selling prices asps for adsl chipsets during periods of surplus 
in   and  the adsl industry had experienced an oversupply of adsl chipsets and central office equipment 
excessive inventory levels led to soft chipset demand  which in turn led to declining asps 
asps have also been under pressure because of intense competition in the adsl chipset marketplace 
as a result of the soft demand and declining asps for adsl chipsets  our royalty revenue has decreased substantially from the levels we achieved in price decreases for adsl chipsets  and the corresponding decreases in per unit royalties received by us  can be sudden and dramatic 
pricing pressures may continue during the first quarter of and beyond 
our royalty revenue may decline over the long term 
we depend substantially upon a limited number of licensees there are a relatively limited number of semiconductor and equipment companies to which we can license our broadband technology in a manner consistent with our business model 
if we fail to maintain relationships with our current licensees or fail to establish a sufficient number of new licensing relationships  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  our prospective customers may use their superior size and bargaining power to demand license terms that are unfavorable to us and prospective customers may not elect to license from us 
we derive a significant amount of revenue from one customer in  and  we derived  and  respectively of our total revenue from adi 
adi was the first customer to license adsl technology from us in  and their chipsets are the most mature implementations of our technology in the market 
our royalty revenues to date have been primarily due to sales of adi chipsets that use our adsl technology 
our royalty revenue in the near term is highly dependent upon adi s adsl chipset market share and pricing 
the adsl market has experienced significant price erosion  which has adversely affected adi s adsl revenue  which in turn has adversely affected our royalty revenue 
to the extent that adi has lost market share  or loses market share in the future  is unable to transition its product to support new adsl and adslplus standards  or experiences further price erosion in its adsl chipsets  our royalty revenue could decline 
our success requires acceptance of our technology by equipment companies due to our business strategy  our success is dependent on our ability to generate significant royalties from our licensing arrangements with semiconductor manufacturers 
our ability to generate significant royalties is materially affected by the willingness of equipment companies to purchase integrated circuits that incorporate our technology from our licensees 
there are other competitive solutions available for equipment companies seeking to offer broadband communications products 
we face the risk that equipment manufacturers will choose those alternative solutions 
generally  our ability to influence equipment companies decisions whether to purchase integrated circuits that incorporates our technology is limited 
we also face the risk that equipment companies that elect to use integrated circuits that incorporate our technology into their products will not compete successfully against other equipment companies 
many factors beyond our control could influence the success or failure of a particular equipment company that uses integrated circuits based on our technology  including x competition from other businesses in the same industry  x market acceptance of its products  x its engineering  sales and marketing  and management capabilities  x technical challenges of developing its products unrelated to our technology  and x its financial and other resources 
even if equipment companies incorporate chipsets based on our intellectual property into their products  their products may not achieve commercial acceptance or result in significant royalties to us 
our success requires telephone companies to install adsl service in volume the success of our adsl licensing business depends upon telephone companies installing adsl service in significant volumes 
factors that affect the volume deployment of adsl service include x the desire of telephone companies to install adsl service  which is dependent on the development of a viable business model for adsl service  including the capability to market  sell  install and maintain the service  x the pricing of adsl services by telephone companies  x the transition by telephone companies to new adsl technologies  such as adsl  adslplus and vdsl  x the quality of telephone companies networks  x deployment by phone companies of fiber to the home or broadband wireless services  x government regulations  and x the willingness of residential telephone customers to demand adsl service in the face of competitive service offerings  such as cable modems  fiber based service or broadband wireless access 
if telephone companies do not install adsl service in significant volumes  or if telephone companies install broadband service based on other technology  our business will be seriously harmed 
our intellectual property is subject to limited protection because we are a technology provider  our ability to protect our intellectual property and to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others is critical to our success 
we regard our technology as proprietary  and we have a number of patents and pending patent applications 
we also rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark law and non disclosure agreements to protect our unpatented intellectual property 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization 
as part of our licensing arrangements  we typically work closely with our semiconductor and equipment manufacturer licensees  many of whom are also our potential competitors  and provide them with proprietary know how necessary for their development of customized chipsets based on our adsl technology 
although our license agreements contain non disclosure provisions and other terms protecting our proprietary know how and technology rights  it is possible that  despite these precautions  some of our licensees might obtain from us proprietary information that they could use to compete with us in the marketplace 
although we intend to defend our intellectual property as necessary  the steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation 
in the future  we may choose to bring legal action to enforce our intellectual property rights 
any such litigation could be costly and time consuming for us  even if we were to prevail 
moreover  even if we are successful in protecting our proprietary information  our competitors may independently develop technologies substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the misappropriation of our technology or the development of competitive technology could seriously harm our business 
our technology  software or products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
a large and increasing number of participants in the telecommunications and compression industries have applied for or obtained patents 
some of these patent holders have demonstrated a readiness to commence litigation based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement 
third parties may assert patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business 
in the past  we have received claims from other companies that our technology infringes their patent rights 
intellectual property rights can be uncertain and can involve complex legal and factual questions 
we may infringe the proprietary rights of others  which could result in significant liability for us 
if we were found to have infringed any third party s patents  we could be subject to substantial damages and an injunction preventing us from conducting our business 
our business is subject to rapid technological change the semiconductor and telecommunications industries  as well as the market for high speed network access technologies  are characterized by rapid technological change  with new generations of products being introduced regularly and with ongoing evolutionary improvements 
we expect to depend on our adsl technology for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
therefore  we face risks that others could introduce competing technology that renders our adsl technology less desirable or obsolete 
also  the announcement of new technologies could cause our licensees or their customers to delay or defer entering into arrangements for the use of our existing technology 
either of these events could seriously harm our business 
we expect that our business will depend to a significant extent on our ability to introduce enhancements and new generations of our adsl technology as well as new technologies that keep pace with changes in the telecommunications and broadband industries and that achieve rapid market acceptance 
we must continually devote significant engineering resources to achieving technical innovations 
these innovations are complex and require long development cycles 
moreover  we may have to make substantial investments in technological innovations before we can determine their commercial viability 
we may lack sufficient financial resources to fund future development 
also  our licensees may decide not to share certain research and development costs with us 
revenue from technological innovations  even if successfully developed  may not be sufficient to recoup the costs of development 
one element of our business strategy is to assume the risks of technology development failure while reducing such risks for our licensees 
in the past  we have spent significant amounts on development projects that did not produce any marketable technologies or products  and we cannot assure you that it will not occur again 
we face intense competition from a wide range of competitors our success as an intellectual property supplier depends on the willingness and ability of semiconductor manufacturers to design  build and sell integrated circuits based on our intellectual property 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  cyclical market patterns and increasing foreign and domestic competition 
as an intellectual property supplier to the semiconductor industry  we face intense competition from internal development teams within potential semiconductor customers 
we must convince potential licensees to license from us rather than develop technology internally 
furthermore  semiconductor customers  who have licensed our intellectual property  may choose to abandon joint development projects with us and develop chipsets themselves without using our technology 
in addition to competition from internal development teams  we compete against other independent suppliers of intellectual property 
we anticipate intense competition from suppliers of intellectual property for adsl 
the market for adsl chipsets is also intensely competitive 
our success within the adsl industry requires that adsl equipment manufacturers buy chipsets from our semiconductor licensees  and that telephone companies buy adsl equipment from those equipment manufacturers 
our customers chipsets compete with products from other vendors of standards based and adsl chipsets  including broadcom  centillium  conexant  st microelectronics and texas instruments 
adsl services offered over copper telephone networks also compete with alternative broadband transmission technologies that use the telephone network as well as other network architectures 
alternative technologies for the telephone network include symmetric high speed dsl also known as hdsl  sdsl and g 
shdsl  and very high speed dsl  also known as vdsl 
these dsl technologies may be based on techniques other than those used by adsl to transport high speed data over telephone lines 
while we are actively developing vdsl technology to meet new vdsl standards  we are not certain that we will be able to participate in future vdsl deployments 
alternative technologies that use other network architectures to provide high speed data service include cable modems using cable networks  wireless solutions using wireless networks  and optical solutions using fiber optics technology 
these alternative broadband technologies may be more successful than adsl and we may not be able to participate in the markets involving these alternative technologies 
many of our current and prospective adsl licensees  as well as chipset competitors that compete with our semiconductor licensees  including broadcom  conexant  st microelectronics and texas instruments have significantly greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and personnel resources than we do 
we may be unable to compete successfully  and competitive pressures could seriously harm our business 
we must make judgments in the process of preparing our financial statements we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and certain critical accounting polices that are relevant to our business 
the application of these principles and policies requires us to make significant judgments and estimates 
in the event that judgments and estimates we make are incorrect  we may have to change them  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
moreover  accounting standards have been subject to rapid change and evolving interpretations by accounting standards setting organizations over the past few years 
the implementation of new standards requires us to interpret and apply them appropriately 
if our current interpretations or applications are later found to be incorrect  our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected 
our stock price may be extremely volatile volatility in our stock price may negatively affect the price you may receive for your shares of common stock and increases the risk that we could be the subject of costly securities litigation 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and could continue to fluctuate based on a variety of factors  including x quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  x changes in future financial guidance that we may provide to investors and public market analysts  x changes in our relationships with our licensees  x announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our licensees or our competitors  x changes in adsl market growth rates as well as investor perceptions regarding the investment opportunity that companies participating in the adsl industry afford them  x changes in earnings estimates by public market analysts  x key personnel losses  x sales of common stock  and x developments or announcements with respect to industry standards  patents or proprietary rights 
in addition  the equity markets have experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our business may be affected by government regulations the extensive regulation of the telecommunications industry by federal  state and foreign regulatory agencies  including the federal communications commission  and various state public utility and service commissions  could affect us through the effects of such regulation on our licensees and their customers 
in addition  our business may also be affected by the imposition of certain tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that our customers obtain from non domestic suppliers or by the imposition of export restrictions on products sold internationally and incorporating our technology 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  in the united states or elsewhere  could seriously harm our business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  and the effect that changes in interest rates would have on that portfolio 
our investment portfolio has included x cash and cash equivalents  which consist of financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less  x short term investments  which consist of financial instruments with remaining maturities of twelve months or less  and auction rate securities that typically have interest reset dates of twenty eight days  and x investments  which consist of financial instruments that mature in three years or less 
all of our investments meet the high quality standards specified in our investment policy 
this policy dictates the maturity period and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  and type of instrument 
the interest rates on our auction rate securities are typically reset by auction every twenty eight days 
although our auction rate securities have been readily marketable  if an auction were to fail  we may not be able to sell these securities on the planned reset date thereby increasing our holding period 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had invested million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments that matured in twelve months or less 
due to the short duration of these financial instruments  we do not expect that an increase in interest rates would result in any material loss to our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had invested million in long term investments that matured in one to three years 
these long term securities are invested in high quality corporate securities and us government securities 
despite the high quality of these securities  they may be subject to interest rate risk 
this means that if interest rates increase  the principal amount of our investment would probably decline 
a large increase in interest rates may cause a material loss to our long term investments 
the following table dollars in thousands presents hypothetical changes in the fair value of our long term investments at december  the modeling technique measures the change in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates
