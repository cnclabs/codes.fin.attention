critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgment  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  workers compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
our most critical accounting policies include the recognition of revenue upon completion of certain phases of projects under research and development contracts 
the company also assesses a need for an allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses its exposure to current commitments and contingencies 
it should be noted that actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
during the year ended march   we elected to prospectively recognize the fair value of stock options granted to employees and members of the board of directors  effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which resulted in our taking a charge of   and  during the years ended march   and  respectively 
the fair value of stock options held by employees and members of the board of directors which have been granted or repriced subsequent to march  is expected to continue to affect the results of operations of future periods  as we continue to grant or reprice stock options to reward our management team 
year ended march  vs 
year ended march  our auditor s report on the accompanying financial statements state that such financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
we have incurred significant losses during our fiscal years ended march  and march  although proceeds were raised during our latest private placement  our auditor s continued to state in their report that conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of the assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
management believes that cost reductions already implemented will reduce losses in the future  and with our existing working capital levels  anticipate that we will be able to continue our operations at least through the end of our current fiscal year 
our revenues for the year ended march  were  an increase of  or approximately  over the comparable prior year 
for the year ended march   revenues consisted of a  non refundable payment received from purdue pharma lp granting it the right to evaluate certain abuse resistant drug formulation technology   in manufacturing fees   in royalty fees and  in testing fees 
revenues for the year ended march  consisted of research and development fees earned in conjunction with our distinct development  license and manufacturing agreements 
research and development costs for the year ended march   were  an increase of  or approximately from  for the comparable period of the prior year  primarily the result of an increase relating to wages  raw materials  laboratory and manufacturing supplies and consulting fees 
we expect our research and development costs to continue to increase in future periods as a result of the erl joint venture termination as we will be solely responsible to fund product development  which we will do from the internal resources or through loans or investment by third parties 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended march   were  a decrease of  or approximately from the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to a decrease in litigation costs offset somewhat by increases in salaries and staff  consulting fees and the write off of a bad debt relating to accounts receivable 
we are unable to provide a break down of the specific costs associated with the research and development of each product on which we devoted resources because a significant portion of the costs are generally associated with salaries  laboratory supplies  laboratory and manufacturing expenses  utilities and similar expenses 
we have not historically allocated these expenses to any particular product 
in addition  we cannot estimate the additional costs and expenses that may be incurred in order to potentially complete the development of any product  nor can we estimate the amount of time that might be involved in such development because of the uncertainties associated with the development of controlled release drug delivery products as described in this report 
depreciation and amortization increased by  from  to other expenses for the year ended march  were  a decrease of  or approximately from  for the prior year 
the decrease was due to a reduction by  in charges related to the issuances of stock options and warrants and a charge of  in the prior year related to the warrant exchange offer  offset partially by a charge in the year ended march  relating to the repricing of stock options in the amount of  additional interest income  due to higher compensating balances as a result of the private placement  was offset by increases in interest expense resulting from the equipment financing 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s net loss for the year ended march  was  compared to  for the year ended march  increases in operating expenses of  were more than offset by decreases in other expenses of  year ended march  vs

other expenses for the year ended march  were  an increase of  or approximately from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to charges related to the modification of the warrant exchange offer  the issuance of stock options and warrants valued at  an increase of  and the reduction in interest income due to lower rates and compensating balances in the amount of  partially offset by increases in sale of new jersey  tax losses of  and the settlement of vendor litigation for  our net loss for the year ended march  was  as compared to  in the prior year  or an increase of approximately from the prior year  primarily due to the decrease in net revenues  and increases in research and development and administrative expenses  including increased charges of  due to the issuance of stock options  warrants and the modification of warrant exchange offer
