we design and manufacture satellite communications equipment through wegener communications  inc wci  a wholly owned subsidiary 
wci is a leading provider of digital solutions for video  audio and ip data networks 
applications include ip data delivery  broadcast television  cable television  radio networks  business television  distance education  business music and financial information distribution 
we operate on a week fiscal year 
the fiscal year ends on the friday nearest to august fiscal years and contained weeks while fiscal year contained weeks 
all references herein to  and  refer to the fiscal years ending september   september   and august   respectively 
overview our fiscal revenues improved compared to fiscal revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal however  we did not achieve the revenue growth that we expected in fiscal due to lower than expected shippable orders for the year  especially for our ipump system 
subsequent to september   million in new orders have been booked 
four significant orders were received from two radio networks  a government agency and a private network 
ipump systems accounted for more than of these orders 
additionally  within this time frame  initial orders for the smd streaming media decoder  our high definition mpeg h 
set top box  have been received 
these new orders are scheduled to begin shipping in the first quarter of fiscal and continue throughout fiscal and beyond 
we are actively pursuing opportunities to increase orders needed to achieve revenue goals for fiscal due to the current level of additional orders needed for the first half of fiscal  it is likely that we will have an operating loss for that period 
management is working to improve near term bookings 
we continue to believe the ipump is the right product for our markets and will make a significant contribution to future revenues 
the ipump media server uses a store and forward approach to network operations compared to traditional real time video and audio delivery networks 
the ipump media server provides customers with many additional capabilities not available in traditional real time delivery networks  such as streaming video and audio to the desktop  more efficient use of expensive satellite bandwidth and the ability to originate two complete television networks from a single unit 
mediaplan i o and mediaplan cm modules provide control over storing and managing digital media content 
these features enhance network content management and ease of network operations 
current developments over the past two years  senior management has been developing a much stronger executive team to focus on improvements in our operations 
during fiscal  sharper focus has been brought to bear in the following areas execution of product development projects in a more focused and cost effective manner  improvement of our strategic planning processes with an emphasis on improving marketing data input  improvement of sales effectiveness with additional training and new personnel  and a renewed focus on the customers we serve and our value proposition to them 
we have made improvements in our product development processes that will allow products to be developed  properly tested and released to the marketplace in a more timely manner 
improvements have also been made in ensuring that the proper feature sets are being developed for new products 
we have recently hired a very experienced and successful vice president of sales 
he is a proven executive with experience in understanding current markets and opening new opportunities for growth 
other changes have been made in the sales team 
we are working with our outside strategic planning consultants to assist us in improving operations and to develop additional markets and opportunities for our products 
we completed an initial review of our operations that resulted in a reduction in our workforce during the last week of fiscal we are continuing to monitor costs in relation to revenues 
revenue opportunities appear to be most significant in the radio and business private network markets with our ipump solutions 
we are in the process of deploying a rollout of ipump for the broadcast radio market and are working with multiple customers on additional programs 
we believe our ipump  mediaplan and compel products create systems that directly address the next generation needs of satellite delivery of content 
we continue to invest in and develop our smd streaming media decoder settop for the telecom market 
the smd enables telecom companies to offer iptv services  including high definition television  to existing dsl consumers 
we showcased the smd utilizing mpeg h 
video streams to display high definition video at the october telecom and at the november telco tv tradeshow 
mpeg is a key focus for next generation video distribution network architectures in satellite  telecom and cable markets 
financial position and liquidity we have no long term debt or line of credit borrowings outstanding at september  our cash balances were  at september  our  bank loan facility  which is subject to availability advance formulas based on eligible accounts receivable  import letter of credit commitment balances and inventories  is currently being used to support import letters of credit issued to our offshore manufacturers  which at september  amounted to  at september   approximately  net of the outstanding letters of credit was available to borrow under the advance formulas 
we expect to utilize borrowings on the line of credit beginning in the first half of fiscal to support operations 
if we achieve our revenue projections for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  we expect to exceed our line of credit limit of  during this period 
an increase in the line of credit would be required to support anticipated increases in inventory  accounts receivable and letter of credit commitment balances beginning in the third quarter of fiscal no assurances may be given that the bank would grant an increase in the line of credit or that upon maturity the line will be renewed or that additional sources of capital  if needed  would be available 
should anticipated future revenues not materialize  we are committed to reducing operating costs to bring them in line with revenue levels 
see the liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion

revenues for fiscal increased  or  to  from  in fiscal direct broadcast satellite dbs revenues including service revenues in fiscal increased  or  to  from  in fiscal telecom and custom product revenues decreased  or  in fiscal to  from  in fiscal revenues and order backlog are subject to the timing of significant orders from customers  and as a result revenue levels may fluctuate on a quarterly and yearly basis 
fiscal revenues included two new orders from ascent media of ipump media servers  digital encoders and unity receivers for a private network application and to convert a television distribution network from analog to digital and upgrade the network s capabilities with store and forward technology 
initial shipments were made to fox newsedge to upgrade their network operations using compel network control  mediaplan and ipump media servers 
shipments continued to roberts communications network on additional orders of uplink equipment and unity receivers to upgrade its existing network 
fiscal also included shipments of transmission equipment  receivers and our compel network control system to a new radio broadcast customer for network upgrades and expansion and to microspace communications for delivery of audio programming for the christian radio consortium 
the telecom and custom products group revenue decrease in fiscal reflected a continuing decline in orders for older analog and cue and control equipment 
revenues for fiscal decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal direct broadcast satellite dbs revenues including service revenues in fiscal decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal telecom and custom product revenues decreased  or  in fiscal to  from  in fiscal dbs revenues and bookings were adversely impacted by delayed purchasing decisions in the digital satellite transmission market and particularly by a longer than expected sales cycle for the ipump media server and dtv series products 
fiscal revenues included shipments of network equipment to roberts communications for network upgrades and expansion  and to ascent media for new cable network applications and expansion of private video networks 
shipments to ascent media included deliveries of ipump media servers for their network applications 
the telecom and custom products group revenue decrease in fiscal was primarily due to completion of shipments of commercial insertion equipment in fiscal to a cable television operator 
wci s backlog of orders scheduled to ship within months was  at september   compared to  at september   and  at august  the total multi year backlog at september   was approximately  approximately  of the september   backlog is expected to ship during fiscal subsequent to september   million in new orders have been booked 
these new orders are scheduled to begin shipping in the first quarter of fiscal and continue throughout the fiscal year and beyond 
three customers accounted for of our backlog at september  and for of the backlog expected to ship during fiscal sales to a relatively small number of major customers have typically comprised a majority of our revenues and that trend is expected to continue 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  segment information and significant customers 
future revenues are subject to the timing of significant orders from customers and are difficult to forecast 
as a result  we expect future revenue levels and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
international sales are generated through a direct sales organization and through foreign distributors 
international sales were  or of revenues in fiscal compared to  or of revenues in fiscal  and  or of revenues in fiscal international shipments are generally project specific  and revenues  therefore  are subject to variations from year to year based on the timing of customer orders 
all international sales are denominated in us dollars 
additional financial information on geographic areas is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
gross profit as a percent of sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal gross profit margin dollars increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal fiscal gross profit margin dollars amounted to  the increase in margin percentages and dollars in fiscal was mainly due to higher revenues  which resulted in lower unit fixed overhead costs and a favorable product sales mix with lower variable cost components 
fiscal gross margin dollars and percentages were favorably impacted by an adjustment of accrued expenses of  profit margins in fiscal included inventory reserve charges of  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses were of revenues in fiscal and in fiscal corporate sg a expenses in fiscal increased  compared to fiscal corporate sg a expenses in fiscal included an insurance reimbursement of  for a portion of legal costs expensed in fiscal related to defending the company against an unsolicited  hostile takeover attempt by radyne comstream  inc wci s sg a expenses increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in wci s sg a expenses in fiscal was mainly due to higher sales salaries of  due to an increase in personnel  increases in selling and marketing expenses of  due to increased sales activity and sales commissions  higher consulting expenses of  related to strategic planning and increases in relocation expenses and placement fees of  these expenses were offset by lower professional fees at wci of  sg a expenses decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses were of revenues in fiscal and in fiscal sg a expenses in fiscal included an insurance reimbursement of  described above

wci s sg a expenses increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal sales and marketing salary expenses increased  due to an increase in personnel and marketing expenses increased  due to increased sales activity related to new products 
general corporate expenses included in sg a expense were approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal included an insurance reimbursement of  for a portion of the fiscal corporate legal costs 
sarbanes oxley compliance costs for fiscal were approximately  compared to none in fiscal research and development expenditures  including capitalized software development costs  were  or of revenues in fiscal   or of revenues in fiscal  and  or of revenues in fiscal the increase in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increased prototype part costs and placement fees 
the increase in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increases in engineering consulting expenses primarily related to the development of ipump media server and the dtv series products 
software development costs totaling   and  were capitalized during fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases in capitalized software costs in fiscal compared to fiscal are due to decreased expenditures on the ipump media server  unity and dtv series products  which were partially offset by increased expenditures on the smd product 
the increases in capitalized software costs during fiscal compared to are due to increased expenditures on the compel network control software  the ipump media server  unity and dtv series products 
research and development expenses  excluding capitalized software development costs  were  or of revenues in fiscal   or of revenues in fiscal  and  or of revenues in fiscal we expect fiscal research and development expenditures to approximate fiscal levels as we continue to develop and enhance dbs products 
interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal interest expense in fiscal years  and was principally associated with letters of credit commitments and bank float charges on lockbox collections 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the average outstanding letter of credit commitment balances 
we believe that interest expense in fiscal will increase compared to fiscal as a result of expected increases in line of credit borrowings  as well as increases in prime rates 
interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and by a one time benefit of  in fiscal related to the collection of a trade accounts receivable 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents  which was offset by the one time benefit of  related to the collection of a trade accounts receivable 
fiscal income tax expense of  was comprised of deferred federal and state tax expenses of  and  respectively 
federal and state tax expenses included a fourth quarter non cash charge of  to provide a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered in judging the likelihood of realizing tax benefits 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
cumulative losses are one of the most difficult pieces of negative evidence to overcome in the absence of sufficient existing orders and backlog versus forecasted future orders supporting a return to profitability 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  it became evident we would not meet our forecast for actual orders and profitability for the fourth quarter and fiscal year this lessened the weight that we could assign to future prospects for returning to consistent profitability 
although order activity subsequent to september   points to an improvement in backlog  additional orders and backlog are currently needed to return to profitability in fiscal that  combined with recent cumulative net losses  represented sufficient negative evidence that was difficult for positive evidence to overcome under the evaluation guidance of sfas no 
our assessment in applying sfas no 
indicated that a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets was required as of september  the effect was to reverse the benefits of net deferred tax assets that were recorded in prior years financial statements 
these tax benefits will be available  prior to the expiration of carryforwards  to reduce future income tax expense resulting from earnings or increases in deferred tax liabilities 
at september   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of  of which  expires in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal additionally  we had an alternative minimum tax credit of  and a state income tax credit of  expiring in fiscal  all of which were fully offset by the valuation allowance 
fiscal income tax benefit of  was comprised of deferred federal and state tax benefits of  and  respectively 
net deferred tax assets increased  to  at september  the increase was principally due to increases in net operating loss carryforwards  offset by reductions of general business and foreign tax credits of  which expired september  fiscal income tax expense of  was comprised of a current federal income tax benefit of  and deferred federal and state income tax expenses of  and  respectively 
the fiscal state income tax benefits were favorably impacted primarily by state income tax credits of  related to georgia retraining credits 
a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate as compared to the statutory us income tax rate is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective or difficult judgements 
these policies are as follows revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement with the customer exists  products are shipped or title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the customer  the amount due from the customer is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and there are no significant future performance obligations 
service revenues are recognized at the time of performance 
revenues from separate service maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
we recognize revenue in certain circumstances before delivery has occurred commonly referred to as bill and hold transactions 
in such circumstances  among other things  risk of ownership has passed to the buyer  the buyer has made a written fixed commitment to purchase the finished goods  the buyer has requested the finished goods be held for future delivery as scheduled and designated by them  and no additional performance obligations exist by us 
for these transactions  the finished goods are segregated from inventory and normal billing and credit terms are granted 
for the year ended september   revenues to one customer in the amount of  were recorded prior to delivery as bill and hold transactions 
at september   accounts receivable for these revenues amounted to  and were paid in full subsequent to september  these policies require management  at the time of the transaction  to assess whether the amounts due are fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and no future performance obligations exist 
these assessments are based on the terms of the agreement with the customer  past history and creditworthiness of the customer 
if management determines that collection is not reasonably assured or future performance obligations exist  revenue recognition is deferred until these conditions are satisfied 
our principal sources of revenues are from the sales of various satellite communications equipment 
embedded in our products is internally developed software of varying applications 
historically  we have not sold or marketed our software separately or otherwise licensed our software apart from the related communications equipment 
should we begin to market or sell software whereby it is more than an incidental component of the hardware  then we would recognize software license revenue in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition as amended by sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost at standard  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
inventories include the cost of raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we make inventory reserve provisions to properly reflect inventory value based on a review of inventory quantities on hand  sales forecasts  new products being developed and technology changes 
these reserves are to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving inventory that is unsaleable or saleable at reduced prices  which could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
at september   inventories  net of reserve provisions  amounted to  capitalized software costs software development costs are capitalized subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
capitalized costs are amortized based on the larger of the amounts computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for each product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
expected future revenues and estimated economic lives are subject to revisions due to market conditions  technology changes and other factors resulting in shortfalls of expected revenues or reduced economic lives  which could result in additional amortization expense or write offs 
at september   capitalized software costs  net of accumulated amortization  amounted to  deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards  if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss and credit carryforwards 
as discussed in the results of operations section of this md a  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a  non cash income tax charge to establish a full valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets 
accounts receivable valuation we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at september   accounts receivable net of allowances for doubtful accounts amounted to  liquidity and capital resources at september   our primary sources of liquidity were cash of  and a  bank loan facility  which matures on june  cash and cash equivalents decreased  in fiscal we have no long term debt or line of credit borrowings outstanding at september  our bank loan facility  which is subject to availability advance formulas based on eligible accounts receivable  import letter of credit commitment balances and inventories  is currently being used to support import letters of credit issued to our offshore manufacturers  which at september  amounted to  at september   approximately  net of the outstanding letters of credit was available to borrow under the advance formulas 
we expect to utilize borrowings on the line of credit beginning in the first half of fiscal to support operations 
if we achieve our revenue projections for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  we expect to exceed our line of credit limit of  during this period 
an increase in the line of credit would be required to support anticipated increases in inventory  accounts receivable and letter of credit commitment balances beginning in the third quarter of fiscal no assurances may be given that the bank would grant an increase in the line of credit or that upon maturity the line will be renewed or that additional sources of capital  if needed  would be available 
should anticipated future revenues not materialize  we are committed to reducing operating costs to bring them in line with revenue levels 
in addition  at september   we had land and buildings and improvements with a cost basis of  which had no mortgage balances outstanding 
land and buildings are not currently used in the existing loan facility s availability advance formulas  however  we believe these assets could be used to support additional borrowing capacities either with our existing bank or from other sources 
cash provided by operating activities was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal fiscal net loss adjusted for noncash expenses provided cash of  increases in inventories and other assets used cash of  while changes in accounts receivable and customer deposits provided cash of  changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses provided cash of  cash used by investing activities in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal in fiscal  investing activities used cash of  for property and equipment expenditures   for capitalized software additions and  for legal expenses related to the filing of applications for various patents and trademarks 
capitalized software expenditures were incurred primarily for the development of compel network control and mediaplan software  the ipump media server  and the smd streaming media settop product 
property and equipment expenditures were for planned additions of principally manufacturing and engineering test equipment 
fiscal expenditures for investing activities are expected to approximate fiscal levels 
cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal cash used by financing activities was  in fiscal in fiscal  financing activities used cash of  for loan facility fees  and provided  of cash from the exercise of stock options 
net accounts receivable decreased  to  at september   from  at september   compared to  at august  the decrease in fiscal was due to lower average days outstanding of fiscal receivables  primarily due to a prepayment on a large order from one customer  compared to the same period of fiscal the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at september    at september  and  at august  write offs were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal recoveries in fiscal were  increases to the allowance and charges to general and administrative expense were  in fiscal  in fiscal and  in fiscal customer deposits increased  to  at september   from  at september   primarily due to one customer booking scheduled to ship in fiscal customer deposits vary with the timing and terms of customer bookings 
inventory before reserves increased  or  to  at september   from  at september  during fiscal  inventory reserves were increased by provisions charged to cost of sales of  the increase in the provision was to provide additional reserves for slower moving analog products  excess digital audio inventories  and potentially slow moving inventories of earlier generations of other digital products 
these products continue to sell but at reduced quantities 
inventory reserves were increased by provisions charged to cost of sales of  in fiscal and  in fiscal inventory reserves were decreased by write offs of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal and  increases in inventories used cash of  and  respectively 
during fiscal  decreases in inventories provided cash of  wci s bank loan facility provides a maximum available credit limit of  subject to availability advance formulas 
the loan facility matures on june   or upon demand and requires an annual facility fee of 
of the maximum credit limit 
the loan facility consists of a term loan and a revolving line of credit with a combined borrowing limit of  bearing interest at the bank s prime rate at september  the term loan facility provides for a maximum of  for advances of up to of the cost of equipment acquisitions 
principal advances are payable monthly over months with a balloon payment due at maturity 
the revolving line of credit is subject to availability advance formulas of against eligible accounts receivable  of eligible raw materials inventories  of eligible work in process kit inventories  to of eligible finished goods inventories  and of import letter of credit commitment balances 
the loan is secured by a first lien on substantially all of wci s assets and guaranteed by wegener corporation 
at september   no balances were outstanding on the revolving line of credit or the equipment term loan portions of the loan facility 
the loan facility is currently being used to support import letters of credit issued to offshore manufacturers  which at september  amounted to  at september   approximately  net of outstanding letters of credit  was available to borrow under the advance formulas 
we are required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth with annual increases at each fiscal year end commencing with fiscal year  retain certain key employees  maintain certain financial ratios  and are precluded from paying dividends 
at september   we were not in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant  for which the bank granted a waiver 
we have two manufacturing and purchasing agreements for certain finished goods inventories 
at september   outstanding purchase commitments under these agreements amounted to  pursuant to the above agreements  at september   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of  in addition  at september   we had an outstanding commitment for engineering design and software development services in the amount of  a summary of our long term contractual obligations as of september  consisted of payments due by period contractual obligations total one year years years operating leases purchase commitments total in addition we license certain technologies under various license agreements which require royalty payments based on the sales volume of certain products 
see the discussion under the section patents  trademarks  licenses  franchises and concessions held above 
off balance sheet arrangements at september   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on revenues or expenses during the past three fiscal years 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no  chapter  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
that expense will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
this standard is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first annual period beginning after june  we will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective application method beginning september  under this method  sfas r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered  such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption  shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas effective as of september   the board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting on all remaining unvested out of the money options 
these unvested options had exercise prices greater than  the closing price of wgnr common stock on september  the acceleration covered options for  shares  exercisable at  of which were scheduled to vest over the next three fiscal years 
the purpose of the vesting acceleration was to reduce the expense that would be associated with these options in accordance with the adoption of sfaf no 
r 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
by focusing the exception on exchanges that lack commercial substance  the board believes sfas no 
produces financial reporting that more faithfully represents the economics of the transactions 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of this new statement will have a material impact on our financial statements

 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
this statement shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued 
we do not believe that adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
outlook issues and uncertainties the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions 
product introductions are generally characterized by increased functionality and better quality  sometimes at reduced prices 
the introduction of products embodying new technology may render existing products obsolete and unmarketable  or marketable at substantially reduced prices 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce on a timely basis new and enhanced products that embody new technology  and achieve levels of functionality and price acceptable to the market  will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the industry  our business and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
wci competes with companies that have substantially greater resources and a larger number of products  as well as with small specialized companies 
through relationships with technology partners and original equipment manufacturer oem suppliers  we are positioned to provide end to end solutions to our customers 
competition in the market for our mpeg broadcast television electronics products  including digital video equipment  is driven by timeliness  performance and price 
our broadcast digital video products in production are competitively priced  with unique  desirable features 
the compel network control system meets customer needs by providing regionalization of receiver control and spot advertisement 
due to the large number of potential end users  both small and large competitors continue to emerge 
we believe we are positioned to capitalize on the market trends in this business through careful development of products and market strategies 
in the cable television market we believe that the competitive position for many of our products is strong 
however  the unity product family competes with significant and established firms 
other products for cable television include proprietary cueing and network control devices 
competition for radio network products  including our digital audio products  is very aggressive and pricing is very competitive 
we believe that success in all of our markets will depend on aggressive marketing and product development 
the demand for digital products is being driven by the high cost of satellite capacity and increasing demand for video and multi media content 
the digital conversion of major networks is expected to continue  but it remains difficult to predict the precise timing and number of customers converting to digital 
we believe the market as a whole has considerable built up demand for digital technology 
although no assurances can be given  we expect to directly benefit from this increase in demand 
there may be fluctuations in our revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter due to several factors  including the timing of significant orders from customers and the timing of new product introductions by us 
we have invested a significant amount of financial resources to acquire certain raw materials  to incur direct labor and to contract to have specific outplant procedures performed on inventory in process 
we purchased this inventory based upon previously known backlog and anticipated future sales  given existing knowledge of the marketplace 
our inventory reserve of  at september   is to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving inventory that is unsaleable or saleable at reduced prices 
no estimate can be made of a range of amounts of loss from obsolescence that might occur should our sales efforts not be successful 
sales to a relatively small number of major customers have typically comprised a majority of our revenues  and that trend is expected to continue throughout fiscal and beyond 
future revenues are subject to the timing of significant orders from customers and are difficult to forecast 
as a result  future revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
three customers accounted for of the backlog at september  and for of the backlog scheduled to ship during fiscal our gross margin percentage is subject to variations based on the product mix sold in any given period and on sales volumes 
start up costs associated with new product introductions could adversely impact costs and future margins 
we are very focused on controlling both direct and indirect manufacturing costs and other operating expenses 
these costs will be adjusted as necessary if revenues do not increase as planned 
management believes that digital compression technology may be profitably employed to create increased demand for our satellite receiving equipment if those products are manufactured in a high volume  standardized production environment 
certain raw materials  video sub components and licensed video processing technologies used in existing and future products are currently available from a single source or limited sources 
although we believe that all single source components are currently available in adequate quantities  there can be no assurance that shortages or unanticipated delivery interruptions will not develop in the future
