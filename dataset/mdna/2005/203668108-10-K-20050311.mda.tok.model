item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
executive overview we are the largest non urban provider of general hospital healthcare services in the united states in terms of number of facilities 
we generate revenue by providing a broad range of general hospital healthcare services to patients in the communities in which they are located 
we are paid for our services by governmental agencies  private insurers and directly by the patients we serve 
for the year ended december   we generated billion in net operating revenues  a growth of over the year ended december   and million of net income  an increase of over the year ended december  for the year ended december   admissions at hospitals owned throughout both periods decreased and adjusted admissions increased 
we have continued to generate strong cash flows as evidenced by the million of operating cash flow generated for the year ended december   an increase of over the prior year 
this increase in cash flow is primarily the result of our growth in income from continuing operations and improvements in the collection of accounts receivable at hospitals owned throughout both periods 
during we were involved in the following transactions  each of which demonstrates the continued execution of our operating strategy or our efforts to maximize shareholder value acquired two hospitals  refinanced our senior secured credit facility and expanded our borrowing capacity  in connection with the sale of our shares by funds affiliated with forstmann little co  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock  sold two under performing hospitals  identified one under performing hospital as a candidate for disposition  completed the sale of million of senior subordinated notes  the proceeds of which were used to repay borrowings under the revolving tranche of our credity facility  and continuous improvement in the quality of care provided as evidenced by jcaho survey results 
each of these transactions should be considered in conjunction with our discussion of operating results  liquidity and capital resources 
during the third quarter of  four of our facilities incurred property damage  increased staffing costs and a loss of volume as a result of the hurricanes in august and september 
we estimate our results were negatively impacted by million before income taxes as a result of the impact of these hurricanes 
from time to time we consider hospitals for disposition if we determine their operating results or potential growth no longer meet our strategic objectives 
subsequent to december   we began negotiations and entered into two separate definitive agreements to sell four smaller underperforming hospitals  one of which was a hospital previously classified as being held for sale 
the sales of these facilities are subject to the finalization of buyers on site reviews and regulatory approvals and are expected to close as soon as practicable after the approvals are obtained 
in addition  effective march   we completed the acquisition of an interest in chestnut hill hospital  a licensed bed hospital located in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
acquisitions and dispositions effective july   we acquired galesburg cottage hospital located in galesburg  illinois 
the hospital is located approximately miles west of peoria  illinois 
the hospital  which has a total of licensed beds  was acquired from a local not for profit corporation 
the aggregate consideration for the hospital totaled approximately million of which approximately million was paid in cash and approximately million was assumed in liabilities and incurred as acquisition costs 
effective august   we acquired phoenixville hospital located in phoenixville  pennsylvania  approximately miles west of philadelphia and miles east of reading  pennsylvania 
the acquisition also included a  square foot medical complex in nearby limerick  pennsylvania which houses an ambulatory surgical facility  an imaging center  and medical office space 
the hospital  which has a total of licensed beds  was acquired from the university of pennsylvania health system 
the aggregate consideration for the hospital totaled approximately million of which approximately million was paid in cash and approximately million was assumed in liabilities and incurred as acquisition costs 
effective august   we sold randolph county medical center  a hospital with licensed beds located in pocahontas  arkansas and sabine medical center  a hospital with licensed beds located in many  louisiana  two of our underperforming hospitals  to associated healthcare systems in brentwood  tennessee 
the sale was structured as a sale of stock and includes all owned or leased property of these two medical centers 
the aggregate sales price for these two hospitals was approximately million of which million was cash and million was a note 
in addition  as part of our strategic review  we have decided to market northeast medical center  in bonham  texas  for sale 
from time to time we may also decide to sell other of our hospitals if they no longer meet our strategic objectives  and we believe that removing them from our portfolio of hospitals will add to our shareholder value 
recent developments effective march   we completed the acquisition of an controlling interest in chestnut hill hospital  a licensed bed hospital located in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
the aggregate consideration for the hospital totaled approximately million  of which million was paid in cash and million was assumed in liabilities 
although this hospital is not in our typical non urban target market  we believe it enhances the network of our four hospitals in southeastern pennsylvania that are within to miles of one another 
in february   we also entered into two separate definitive agreements to sell four smaller under performing hospitals 
the sale of these facilities is subject to the finalization of buyers on site reviews and regulatory approvals and is expected to close as soon as practicable after the approvals are obtained 
sources of revenue the following table presents the approximate percentages of net operating revenue received from medicare  medicaid  managed care  self pay and other sources for the periods indicated 
the data for the years presented are not strictly comparable due to the significant effect that hospital acquisitions and dispositions have had on these statistics 
year ended december  medicare medicaid managed care self pay other third party payors total net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost based reimbursement and other payment methods 
in addition  we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
we account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties 
we account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual adjustments and report them in the periods that such adjustments become known 
adjustments related to final settlements or appeals that increased revenue were insignificant in the years ended december   and in the future  we expect the percentage of revenues received from the medicare program to increase due to the general aging of the population 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatient acute services are based on a prospective payment system  depending upon the diagnosis of a patient s condition 
while these rates are indexed for inflation annually  the increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
reductions in the rate of increase in medicare reimbursement may cause our net operating revenue growth to decline 
effective april   centers for medicare and medicaid services implemented changes to the medicare outpatient prospective patient system 
also  beginning april   and extending through march   the consolidated appropriations resolution of and the temporary assistance for needy families block grant extension equalized the rural and urban standardized payment amounts under the medicare inpatient prospective payment system 
along with other changes  this benefit was made permanent when congress passed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of while the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of provides a broad range of provider payment benefits  federal government spending in excess of federal budgetary provisions considered in passage of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of could result in future deficit spending for the medicare system  which could cause future payments under the medicare system to decline 
in addition  specified managed care programs  insurance companies  and employers are actively negotiating the amounts paid to hospitals 
the trend toward increased enrollment in managed care may adversely effect our net operating revenue growth 
results of operations our hospitals offer a variety of services involving a broad range of inpatient and outpatient medical and surgical services 
these include orthopedics  cardiology  occupational medicine  diagnostic services  emergency services  rehabilitation treatment  home health  and skilled nursing 
the strongest demand for hospital services generally occurs during january through april and the weakest demand for these services occurs during the summer months 
accordingly  eliminating the effect of new acquisitions  our net operating revenues and earnings are historically highest during the first quarter and lowest during the third quarter 
the following tables summarize  for the periods indicated  selected operating data 
years ended december  expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues net operating revenues operating expenses a depreciation and amortization minority interest in earnings income from operations interest expense  net loss from early extinguishment of debt income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss on discontinued operations net income years ended december  expressed in percentages percentage increase from prior year net operating revenues admissions adjusted admissions b average length of stay net income same store percentage increase decrease from prior year c net operating revenues admissions adjusted admissions b a operating expenses include salaries and benefits  provision for bad debts  supplies  rent  and other operating expenses 
b adjusted admissions is a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
we computed adjusted admissions by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues 
c includes acquired hospitals to the extent we operated them during comparable periods in both years and excludes hospitals sold in and one hospital held for sale 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenues increased by to billion in from billion in of the million increase in net operating revenues  the hospitals we acquired in and  which are not yet included in same store net operating revenues  contributed approximately million  and hospitals we owned throughout both periods contributed million  an increase of 
of the increase in net operating revenues from hospitals owned throughout both years  we estimate approximately was attributable to increases in rates  acuity level of services provided  and government reimbursement  and was attributable to volume increases in outpatient services 
net operating revenues from volume increases were primarily the result of newly acquired facilities 
net operating revenues attributable to rates and acuity level of services were primarily the result of the recruitment of physician specialists and the addition of new services 
as a result of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  the additional disproportionate share payment began april  and increased reimbursement to us by approximately million in the reimbursement improvement from the change in the labor related share of the hospital diagnosis related group  drg  inpatient payment to which a wage index is applied provided for in this law was effective october  and increased reimbursement by approximately million in also  under this law drg payment rates were increased by the full market basket index of on october   as all hospitals submitted patient quality data to cms  and reimbursement increased by approximately million for inpatient admissions increased by and adjusted admissions increased by due principally to newly acquired hospitals 
we compute adjusted admissions by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues 
on a same store basis  inpatient admissions decreased by 
same store admissions decreased in primarily as a result of a less severe flu and pneumonia season in the third and fourth quarters of  as compared to the third and fourth quarters of same store adjusted admissions increased by and patient days increased 
on a same store basis  net inpatient revenues increased and net outpatient revenues increased 
operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in salaries and benefits  as a percentage of net operating revenues  remained unchanged at in and provision for bad debts  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from in to in  as a result of an increase in uncollected self pay accounts  primarily caused by an increase in self pay revenue 
supplies  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in  due mainly to the impact of the larger hospitals recently acquired  which have significantly higher supply expense as a percentage of net revenue  and the timing of converting these recently acquired hospitals to contracted vendors under a group purchasing arrangement  offset by improvements made to hospitals owned throughout both periods 
rent and other operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  decreased from in to in this decrease was caused primarily by a decrease of of net operating revenue in contract labor expense and an increase in medical specialist fees 
the decrease in contract labor expense is primarily attributable to the non recurring costs of replacement workers as a result of the strike at easton hospital in net income margins decreased from in to in due to the higher percentage of operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues at the hospitals acquired in and  and loss on discontinued operations  offset by decreases in depreciation  interest  and taxes as a percentage of net operating revenue 
on a same store basis  we achieved a decrease in salary and benefits expense of of net operating revenue resulting from a combination of operating efficiency gains 
the provision for bad debts expense increased of net operating revenues as a result of an increase in uncollected self pay accounts 
rent and other operating expenses decreased of net operating revenue primarily as a result of a decrease in malpractice expense of of net operating revenue  and a decrease in contract labor expense of of net operating revenue 
on a same store basis  income from operations as a percentage of net operating revenues increased from in to in  due mainly to decreases in rent and other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization of of net operating revenue 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million  or of net operating revenues  in  from million  or of net operating revenues  in the hospitals acquired in and  prior to being included in same store results  accounted for million of the increase  while facility renovations and purchases of equipment  information systems upgrades  investments in physician recruiting and other deferred items accounted for the remaining million 
interest expense  net  increased by million from million in to million in an increase in the average debt balance in as compared to  due primarily to borrowings to make acquisitions in and and a repurchase of  shares of common stock  which together accounted for a million increase in interest expense  offset by a decrease in interest rates during as compared to which decreased interest expense  net  by million 
the decrease in average interest rates during is the result of the reduction in libor in early provision for income taxes increased million to million in from million in  as a result of the increase in pre tax income 
our effective tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate in is a result of implementing tax saving strategies  which decreased our state tax provision net of federal income tax benefit 
net income was million in compared to net income of million in  an increase of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenues increased by to billion in from billion in of the million increase in net operating revenues  the hospitals we acquired in and  which are not yet included in same store net operating revenues  contributed approximately million  and hospitals we owned throughout both periods contributed million  an increase of 
of the increase in net operating revenues from hospitals owned throughout both years  we estimate approximately was attributable to increases in rates and the acuity level of services provided  was attributable to volume increases and was attributable to increases in government reimbursement 
our ability to recruit physicians to fill the medical needs of the communities we serve and the addition of new services contributed to increased inpatient admissions and increased acuity of services provided 
inpatient admissions increased by and adjusted admissions increased by due principally to newly acquired hospitals 
we computed adjusted admissions by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues 
on a same store basis  inpatient admissions increased by 
the growth in same store admissions in was lower than expected as a result of severe weather in a number of our markets  a loss of admissions from physicians called up for military service  selective service closures at certain hospitals and unusually high cobra utilization in following the increases in unemployment that did not repeat itself in in addition  we believe the economic conditions in led to lower than expected utilization of healthcare services 
an increase in flu and pneumonia related admissions in the fourth quarter of improved our admissions growth over the prior year offsetting a decrease in flu related admissions in the first quarter of same store adjusted admissions decreased by and patient days increased 
on a same store basis  net inpatient revenues increased and net outpatient revenues increased 
operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in salaries and benefits  as a percentage of net operating revenues  decreased from in to in  primarily as a result of improvements at hospitals owned throughout both periods  offset by hospitals acquired in and  which have higher salaries and benefits as a percentage of net operating revenues  for which reductions have not yet been realized and the additional use of contract labor  primarily nursing 
provision for bad debts  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from in to in  as a result of an increase in uncollected self pay accounts  primarily caused by an increase in gross revenue 
supplies  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in  due mainly to the impact of the larger hospitals recently acquired  which have significantly higher supply expense as a percentage of net operating revenue  and the timing of converting these recently acquired hospitals to contracted vendors in our broadlane group purchasing arrangement  offset by improvements made to hospitals owned throughout both periods 
rent and other operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in this increase was caused primarily by an increase of of net operating revenue in contract labor expense and an increase in malpractice insurance expense of  offset by a decrease of for other operating expenses 
the increase in malpractice expense is primarily due to increases in self insured claims and increases in current year premium costs 
the increase in contract labor expense is primarily attributable to the costs of replacement workers as a result of the strike at easton hospital 
net income margins increased from in to in due to decreases in depreciation and amortization and interest as a percentage of net operating revenues  offset by the higher operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues at the hospitals acquired in and on a same store basis  we achieved a decrease in salary and benefits expense of of net operating revenue resulting from a combination of operating efficiency gains  offset by the additional use of contract labor  primarily nursing  to replace the striking workers at easton  of of net operating revenue 
the provision for bad debts expense increased of net operating revenues as a result of an increase in uncollected self pay accounts 
other operating expenses decreased of net operating revenue primarily as a result of an increase in malpractice expense of of net operating revenue  offset by a decrease in supplies expense of of net operating revenue and a decrease in other operating expense of of net operating revenue 
on a same store basis  income from operations as a percentage of net operating revenues increased from in to in  due mainly to a decrease in depreciation and amortization of of net operating revenue 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million  or of net operating revenues  in  from million  or of net operating revenues  in the hospitals acquired in and  prior to being included in same store results  accounted for million of the increase  while facility renovations and purchases of equipment  information systems upgrades  investments in physician recruiting and other deferred items accounted for the remaining million 
interest expense  net  increased by million from million in to million in as a result of a combination of increased borrowings and decreased average interest rates 
the increase in average debt balance in as compared to  due primarily to borrowings to make acquisitions in and  accounted for a million increase  offset by a decrease in interest rates during as compared to of million 
the decrease in average interest rates during is the result of the reduction in llbor in early provision for income taxes increased million to million in from million in  as a result of the increase in pre tax income 
our effective tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate in is due primarily to a reduction in state taxes 
net income was million in compared to net income of million in  an increase of million 
liquidity and capital resources compared to net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  from million during to million during this increase is the result of an increase in net income and non cash expenses  including depreciation and amortization of million  as compared to the prior year  an increase in cash flow from accounts receivable of million resulting primarily from not buying accounts receivables in our acquisitions and the resulting accounts receivable build up during  and an increase in cash flow of million from improving our collection efforts and reducing days revenue outstanding 
these improved cash inflows were offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes of million  an increase in cash paid for employee compensation liabilities of million  which resulted primarily from a timing difference of the and year end pay periods  and the impact of other working capital changes  which resulted in net cash outflow of million 
the use of cash in investing activities decreased million from million in to million in the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions of facilities of million during offset by an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of million during as compared to cash used to purchase property and equipment included million for the construction of replacement facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million from million in to million in in august   we completed a refinancing of our previous credit facility with a billion senior secured credit facility 
the facility consists of a billion term loan with a final maturity of and a million revolving credit facility that matures in primarily as a result of the repurchase of  shares of our common stock  for which we borrowed under our senior secured credit facility to complete and subsequently paid off with proceeds from our million senior subordinated notes offering  our debt as a percentage of total capitalization increased during the current year from at december  to at december  as described more fully in notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  at december   the company had certain cash obligations  which are due as follows in thousands total and thereafter long term debt      senior subordinated notes   convertible notes   capital leases     total long term debt     operating leases replacement facilities and other    open purchase orders   total      as part of an acquisition in  we agreed to build a replacement facility within five years 
the state in which the hospital is located has approved the plans for this replacement hospital 
construction costs for this replacement facility are currently estimated to be approximately million 
in addition as a part of an acquisition in  we committed to spend million related to various commitments primarily capital expenditures within eight years 
these amounts include the remaining amount of capital to be spent 
open purchase orders represent our commitment for items ordered but not yet received 
we do not have any long term purchase commitments under our national purchasing contracts 
as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements at december   we had issued letters of credit primarily in support of potential insurance related claims and specified outstanding bonds of approximately million 
compared to net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million  from million during to million during this decrease was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable from the acquisitions completed in  resulting in approximately million of negative cash flows during  where we did not purchase the seller s accounts receivable 
other factors negatively impacting cash flows were an increase in the number of days revenue outstanding  from days at december  to days at december   resulting in a decrease in cash flow of approximately million  an increase in cash paid for income taxes of million  a decrease in our liability to third payors of million and the pre funding of our benefit trust for employee medical claims in the amount of million in the fourth quarter of factors positively impacting cash flows during as compared to were increases in net income of million  increases in depreciation and amortization expense of million  which is a non cash expense  increases in deferred tax expense of million and the net effect of changes in all other operating assets and liabilities  which resulted in a cash flow increase of million 
the use of cash in investing activities increased million from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to an increase in cash used for acquisitions of facilities of million during and an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of million during as compared to million of the increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment is attributable to the construction of replacement facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million from million in to million in capital expenditures cash expenditures for purchases of facilities was million in  million in and million in our expenditures in include million for the purchase of the two hospitals and a surgery center in one of our current markets and million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the newly acquired hospitals in our capital expenditures in include million for the ten hospitals acquired in  and million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the acquired hospitals in our capital expenditures in include million for the six hospitals acquired in  million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the acquired hospitals in excluding the cost to construct replacement hospitals  our capital expenditures for totaled million compared to million in and million in costs to construct replacement hospitals totaled million in  million  in  and million  including million of capital leases  in the reduction of capital lease liabilities is included in financing activities in our statements of cash flows 
pursuant to hospital purchase agreements in effect as of december   as part of the acquisition in august of the southside regional medical center in petersburg  virginia  we are required to build a replacement facility by august estimated construction costs  including equipment are approximately million 
we expect total capital expenditures of approximately to million in  including approximately to million for renovation and equipment purchases which includes amounts which are required to be expended pursuant to the terms of the hospital purchase agreements and approximately to million for construction and equipment cost of the current and recently completed replacement hospitals 
capital resources net working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the million increase was attributable primarily to an increase in cash balance  supplies and accounts receivable in and a decrease in employee compensation accruals and other accrued liabilities  offset by an increase in accounts payable due primarily to the timing of year end payments and the addition of two hospitals during on august  and subsequently amended on december   we entered into a billion senior secured credit facility with a consortium of lenders 
this facility replaced our previous credit facility and consists of a billion term loan with a final maturity in as opposed to under our previous facility and a million revolving tranche that matures in we may elect from time to time an interest rate per annum for the borrowings under the term loan  and revolving credit facility equal to a an alternate base rate  which will be equal to the greatest of i the prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus basis points the abr  plus basis points for the term loan and the applicable margin for revolving credit loans or b the eurodollar rate plus basis points for the term loan and the eurodollar applicable margin for revolving credit loans 
the applicable margin varies depending on the ratio of our total indebtedness to annual consolidated ebitda  ranging from to for alternate base rate loans and from to for eurodollar loans 
we also pay a commitment fee for the daily average unused commitments under the revolving tranche 
the commitment fee is based on a pricing grid depending on the applicable margin for eurodollar revolving credit loans and ranges from to 
the commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears and on the revolving credit termination date with respect to the available revolving credit commitments 
in addition  we will pay fees for each letter of credit issued under the credit facility 
the purpose of the facility was to refinance our previous credit agreement  repay other indebtedness  and fund general corporate purposes including to declare and pay cash dividends to repurchase shares or make other distributions  subject to certain restrictions 
as of december   our availability for additional borrowings under our revolving tranche was million of which million is set aside for outstanding letters of credit 
we also have the ability to add up to million of securitized debt and million additional term loans under our agreement  which we have not yet accessed 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate under our credit agreement was the terms of the credit agreement include various restrictive covenants 
these covenants include restrictions on additional indebtedness  liens  investments  asset sales  capital expenditures  sale and leasebacks  contingent obligations  transactions with affiliates  dividends and stock repurchases and fundamental changes 
we would be required to amend the existing credit agreement in order to pay dividends to our shareholders in excess of million 
the covenants also require maintenance of various ratios regarding consolidated total indebtedness  consolidated interest  and fixed charges 
we are currently a party to six separate interest swap agreements to limit the effect of changes in interest rates on a portion of our long term borrowings 
under one agreement  effective november  and expiring in november  we pay interest at a fixed rate of 
this agreement has a million notional amount of indebtedness 
under a second agreement  effective november   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in november under a third agreement  effective june   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in june under a fourth agreement  effective june   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in june under a fifth agreement  effective october   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in october under a sixth agreement  effective august   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in august we received a variable rate of interest on each of these swaps based on the three month london inter bank offer rate libor  excluding the margin paid under the senior secured credit facility on a quarterly basis  which is currently basis points for revolver loans and term loans under the senior secured credit facility 
we also were a party to an interest swap agreement with million notional amount of indebtedness and a fixed interest rate of that expired in november we believe that internally generated cash flows  the ability to add million of accounts receivable securitized debt  million of term loans and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and continued access to the bank credit and capital markets will be sufficient to finance acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital requirements through the next months 
we believe these same sources of cash flows  and borrowings under our credit agreement as well as access to bank credit and capital markets will be available to us beyond the next months and into the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements included in our consolidated operating results for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively  of net operating revenue and million and million  respectively  of income from operations  generated from eight hospitals operated by us under operating lease arrangements 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the respective assets and the future lease obligations under these arrangements are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
lease payments under these arrangements are included in rent expense and totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
the current terms of these operating leases expire between january and december  not including lease extensions that we have options to exercise 
the one hospital under lease whose current lease term was previously scheduled to expire in november and was extended to january generated million of net operating revenue and million of income from operations for the year ended december  effective january   this lease was terminated pursuant to its terms 
the operations from this hospital whose lease was not renewed will be classified as discontinued operations beginning with the reporting period ending march  if we allow the remainder of these leases to expire  we would no longer generate revenue nor incur expenses from these hospitals 
in the past  we have utilized operating leases as a financing tool for obtaining the operations of specified hospitals without acquiring  through ownership  the related assets of the hospital and without a significant outlay of cash at the front end of the lease 
we utilize the same operating strategies to improve operations at those hospitals held under operating leases as we do at those hospitals that we own 
we have not entered into any operating leases for hospital operations since december joint ventures we have from time to time sold minority interests in certain of our subsidiaries or acquired subsidiaries with existing minority interest ownership positions 
as of december   these included five hospitals  three surgery centers  and three imaging centers 
the amount of minority interest in equity is included in other long term liabilities and the minority interest in income or loss is recorded as an operating expense 
we do not believe these minority ownerships are material to our financial position or operating results 
as of and for the years ended december  and  the balance of minority interests included in long term liabilities was million and million  respectively  and the amount of minority interest in earnings was million and million  respectively 
reimbursement  legislative and regulatory changes legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing change in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs which will continue to limit payment increases under these programs and in some cases implement payment decreases 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings  interpretations  and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments might  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities 
additionally  there may be a continued rise in managed care programs and future restructuring of the financing and delivery of healthcare in the united states 
these events could cause our future financial results to decline 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
in addition  our suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures  including our case and resource management program  to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
we have generally offset increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement for services  expanding services and reducing costs in other areas 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover or offset future cost increases 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
third party reimbursement net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost based reimbursement and other payment methods 
in addition  we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
contractual allowances are automatically calculated and recorded through our internally developed automated contractual allowance system 
within the automated system  actual medicare drg data  coupled with all payors historical paid claims data  is utilized to calculate the contractual allowances 
this data is automatically updated on a monthly basis and subjected to review by management to ensure accuracy and reasonableness 
we account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties 
we record adjustments to the estimated billings in the periods that such adjustments become known 
we account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual adjustments and report them in future periods as final settlements are determined 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimates  actual payments we receive could be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are related to providing healthcare services to our hospitals patients 
collection of these accounts receivable is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and outstanding patient balances for which the primary insurance payor has paid and the remaining outstanding balance generally deductibles and co payments is owed by the patient 
at the point of service  for patients required to make a co payment  we generally collect less than of the related revenue 
for all procedures scheduled in advance  our policy is to verify insurance coverage prior to the date of the procedure 
insurance coverage is not verified in advance of procedures for walk in and emergency room patients 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated by reserving as uncollectible all governmental and non governmental accounts over days from discharge 
this method is monitored based on our historical cash collections experience 
collections are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
significant changes in payor mix  business office operations  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable 
we do not provide specific reserves by payor category but estimate bad debts as a consolidated provision for total accounts receivable 
we believe our policy of reserving all accounts over days from discharge  without regard to payor class  has resulted in reasonable estimates determined on a consistent basis 
we believe that we collect substantially all of our third party insured receivables which includes receivables from governmental agencies 
since our methodology is not applied by individual payor class  reserving all amounts over days  which includes some accounts that are collectible  has provided us with a reasonable estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover all accounts receivable  including individual amounts in both the day and under and over day categories  that are uncollectible 
to date  we believe there has not been a material difference between our bad debt allowances and the ultimate historical collection rates on accounts receivables including self pay 
we review our overall reserve adequacy by monitoring historical cash collections as a percentage of net revenue less the provision for bad debts 
effective january   we changed our policy relative to the timing of the write off of fully reserved accounts receivable 
previously  all amounts over days from discharge were written off and therefore excluded from the allowance for doubtful accounts and gross accounts receivable 
our new policy is to write off gross accounts receivable when such amounts are placed with outside collection agencies 
we believe this policy more accurately reflects the ongoing collection efforts within our company and is more consistent with industry practices 
this change in policy has no impact on the provision for bad debts and does not impact net accounts receivable as reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   approximately million of uncollected self pay accounts over days from discharge were being actively pursued by our internal collection agency 
at december   we had approximately million of accounts receivable being pursued by various outside collection agencies 
at december   we had approximately million of accounts receivable being pursued by various outside collection agencies 
we expect to collect less than  net of estimated collection fees  of the amounts being pursued by outside collection agencies 
as these amounts have been written off  they are not included in our gross accounts receivable or our allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  we take into consideration estimated collections of these amounts written off in evaluating the reasonableness of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
days revenue outstanding as presented in the following table as of the dates indicated fell within our target range for days revenue outstanding of days as of december  days revenue outstanding the reason our days revenue outstanding decreased from the prior year is the following testing of electronic billing edits under hipaa beginning october  slowed our billing process for specified claims in  mutual of omaha  our sole medicare intermediary  went through a systems conversion in july  which delayed billing and collections of medicare claims  and large acquisitions in the second half of required medicare billing approvals and new medicaid provider numbers delaying our billing at those hospitals 
uncollected accounts are automatically written off if the balance is under  when turned over to an outside collection agency  or over days from discharge if being collected by our internal collection agency through december  at december   we have approximately million in self pay accounts over days from discharge placed with our internal collection agency and approximately million in self pay accounts being pursued by various outside collection agencies 
of these aforementioned amounts  we expect to collect approximately to  net of estimated collection fees 
as the amounts have been written off  they are not included in our gross accounts receivable or our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we take into consideration estimated collections of these amounts written off in evaluating the reasonableness of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the following table is an aging of our gross prior to allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts accounts receivable in thousands balance as of as of december  as of december  days over days days over days total gross accounts receivable    the approximate percentage of total gross accounts receivable prior to allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts summarized by aging categories is as follows as of december  days days days over days a total the approximate percentage of total gross accounts receivable prior to allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts summarized by payor is as follows as of december  insured receivables a self pay receivables a total a the fluctuation as compared to is primarily the result of the change in policy of when accounts are written off as discussed on page although we do not specifically maintain information for individual categories of self pay  included in the percentage of self pay receivables shown in the table above  we estimate uninsured self pay receivables are approximately to  patient deductibles and co insurance after third party insurance payments are approximately to  and those insured patients billed directly because their insurance has not paid are approximately to 
those accounts that are being billed directly to patients because their third party insurance coverage has not paid are reclassed to self pay receivables from insured receivables generally after days from discharge in order to bill the patients directly and get them involved in assisting with the collection process from their third party insurance company 
none of these amounts represents a denial from commercial or other third party payors 
we estimate  on a historical basis  the uncollected portion of self pay receivables related to co insurance  co payments and deductibles ranges from to and the uncollected portion of self pay receivables related to uninsured patients ranges from to 
additionally  we estimate the uncollected portion of self pay receivables related to insured patients billed directly is insignificant 
in the aggregate  we expect the uncollectible portion of all self pay receivables  before recoveries of accounts previously written off  to be approximately to at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as reported in the consolidated financial statements at december  and represents approximately and  respectively of self pay receivables as described above  net of allowances for other discounts 
had we included in gross accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts those accounts written off that were still being pursued by our internal collection agency as is being done at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  would have represented approximately of self pay receivables 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill arising from business combinations is accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets and is not amortized 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be evaluated for impairment at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we selected september th as our annual testing date 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
we estimated the fair values of the related operations using both a debt free discounted cash flow model as well as an adjusted ebitda multiple model 
these models are both based on our best estimate of future revenues and operating costs  based primarily on historical performance and general market conditions  and are subject to review and approval by senior management and the board of directors 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital 
we performed our initial evaluation  as required by sfas no 
 during the first quarter of and the annual evaluation as of each succeeding september no impairment has been indicated by these evaluations 
estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including revenue and profitability projections or fair values  could cause our analysis to indicate that our goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill 
professional liability insurance claims we accrue for estimated losses resulting from professional liability claims to the extent they are not covered by insurance 
the accrual  which includes an estimate for incurred but not reported claims  is based on historical loss patterns and actuarially determined projections and is discounted to its net present value using a weighted average risk free discount rate of and in and  respectively 
to the extent that subsequent claims information varies from management s estimates  the liability is adjusted currently 
our insurance is underwritten on a claims made basis 
prior to june   substantially all of our professional and general liability risks were subject to a million per occurrence deductible  for claims reported from june  through june   these deductibles were million per occurrence 
additional coverage above these deductibles was purchased through captive insurance companies in which we had a minority ownership interest in each and to which the premiums paid by us represented less than of the total premium revenues of each captive insurance company 
concurrently  with the formation of our own wholly owned captive insurance company in june  we terminated our minority interest relationships in those entities 
substantially all claims reported after june  are self insured up to million per claim 
management on occasion has selectively increased the insured risk at certain hospitals based upon insurance pricing and other factors and may continue that practice in the future 
excess insurance for all hospitals was purchased through commercial insurance companies and generally covers us after the self insured amount up to million per occurrence for claims reported prior to june  effective july   reinsurance for the captive was purchased through a commercial insurance company above the million self insured retention in an amount up to million per occurrence 
excess insurance is purchased through commercial insurance companies and covers us from million to million per occurrence 
income taxes we must make estimates in recording provision for income taxes  including determination of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we believe that future income will enable us to realize these deferred tax assets  subject to the valuation allowance we have established 
we operate in multiple states with varying tax laws 
we are subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through fiscal year  which resulted in no material adjustments 
in february  we were notified by the internal revenue service of its intent to examine our consolidated tax return for we make estimates we believe are accurate in order to determine that tax accruals are adequate to cover any potential adjustments arising from tax examinations 
we believe the results of this examination will not be material to our consolidated statements of income or financial position

in addition  sfas no 
r will cause unrecognized expense based on the amounts in our pro forma footnote disclosure related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in our third quarter of  beginning july  under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition alternatives include prospective and retroactive adoption methods 
under the retroactive methods  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas no

this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
as of december   the company adopted the provisions of fin no 
which were effective as of december  and required to be applied to those entities that are considered to be special purpose entities 
the adoption of those effective provisions of fin no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as we have not identified any relationships that would qualify as special purpose entities 
the adoption of the remaining provisions of fin no 
 which were effective for us march   did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we have no investments in variable interest entities 
special note regarding forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements which could differ from actual future results 
some of the matters discussed in this report include forward looking statements 
statements that are predictive in nature  that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or that include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  thinks  and similar expressions are forward looking statements 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results and performance to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
these factors include the following general economic and business conditions  both nationally and in the regions in which we operate  demographic changes  existing governmental regulations and changes in  or the failure to comply with  governmental regulations  legislative proposals for healthcare reform  the impact of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which includes specific reimbursement changes for small urban and non urban hospitals  our ability  where appropriate  to enter into managed care provider arrangements and the terms of these arrangements  changes in inpatient or outpatient medicare and medicaid payment levels  uncertainty with the health insurance portability and accountability act of regulations  increases in wages as a result of inflation or competition for highly technical positions and rising supply cost due to market pressure from pharmaceutical companies and new product releases  liability and other claims asserted against us  including self insured malpractice claims  competition  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  key management  physicians  nurses and other healthcare workers  trends toward treatment of patients in less acute or specialty healthcare settings  including ambulatory surgery centers or specialty hospitals  changes in medical or other technology  changes in generally accepted accounting principles  the availability and terms of capital to fund additional acquisitions or replacement facilities  our ability to successfully acquire and integrate additional hospitals  our ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance  potential adverse impact of known and unknown government investigations  timeliness of reimbursement payments received under government programs  and the other risk factors set forth in our public filings with the securities and exchange commission 
although we believe that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  we can give no assurance that our goals will be achieved 
given these uncertainties  prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are made as of the date of this filing 
we assume no obligation to update or revise them or provide reasons why actual results may differ 
factors that may affect future performance the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual results to differ material from those predicted in the forward looking statements we make about our business 
our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness 
we are significantly leveraged 
the chart below shows our level of indebtedness and other information as of december  this chart does not include million that would be available for future borrowings under the revolving tranche of our senior secured credit facility  of which million is reserved for outstanding letters of credit 
we also have the ability to amend our senior secured credit facility to provide for one or more additional tranches of term loans in aggregate principal amount of up to million 
as of december  senior secured credit facility revolving tranche term loan  notes other total debt  stockholder equity  year ended december  ratio of earnings to fixed charges x a a in calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings consist of income before income taxes plus fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of interest expense which includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt issuance costs and one quarter of rental expense  deemed representative of that portion of rental expense estimated to be attributable to interest 
our substantial degree of leverage could have important consequences for you  including the following it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  including our operations  capital expenditures and future business opportunities  the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  including those related to the notes  some of our borrowings  including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  are at variable rates of interest  exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates  it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business  or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth 
if competition decreases our ability to acquire additional hospitals on favorable terms  we may be unable to execute our acquisition strategy 
an important part of our business strategy is to acquire two to four hospitals each year in non urban markets 
however  not for profit hospital systems and other for profit hospital companies generally attempt to acquire the same type of hospitals as we do 
some of these other purchasers have greater financial resources than we do 
our principal competitors for acquisitions have included health management associates  inc  province healthcare company and lifepoint hospitals  inc during  lifepoint hospitals announced an agreement to acquire province healthcare 
on some occasions  we also compete with universal health services  inc and triad hospitals inc in addition  some hospitals are sold through an auction process  which may result in higher purchase prices than we believe are reasonable 
therefore  we may not be able to acquire additional hospitals on terms favorable to us 
if we fail to improve the operations of future acquired hospitals  we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy 
most of the hospitals we have acquired or will acquire had or may have significantly lower operating margins than we do and or operating losses prior to the time we acquired them 
in the past  we have occasionally experienced temporary delays in improving the operating margins or effectively integrating the operations of these acquired hospitals 
in the future  if we are unable to improve the operating margins of acquired hospitals  operate them profitably  or effectively integrate their operations  we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy 
if we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities  we could become liable for material obligations 
hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations 
although we seek indemnification from prospective sellers covering these matters  we may nevertheless have material liabilities for past activities of acquired hospitals 
state efforts to regulate the sale of hospitals operated by not for profit entities could prevent us from acquiring additional hospitals and executing our business strategy 
many states  including some where we have hospitals and others where we may in the future acquire hospitals  have adopted legislation regarding the sale or other disposition of hospitals operated by not for profit entities 
in other states that do not have specific legislation  the attorneys general have demonstrated an interest in these transactions under their general obligations to protect charitable assets from waste 
these legislative and administrative efforts focus primarily on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non profit seller 
while these review and  in some instances  approval processes can add additional time to the closing of a hospital acquisition  we have not had any significant difficulties or delays in completing acquisitions 
however  future actions on the state level could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals 
state efforts to regulate the construction  acquisition or expansion of hospitals could prevent us from acquiring additional hospitals  renovating our facilities or expanding the breadth of services we offer 
some states require prior approval for the construction or acquisition of healthcare facilities and for the expansion of healthcare facilities and services 
in giving approval  these states consider the need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services 
in some states in which we operate  we are required to obtain certificates of need  known as cons  for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services  and some other matters 
other states may adopt similar legislation 
we may not be able to obtain the required cons or other prior approvals for additional or expanded facilities in the future 
for example  in october  our hospital in jackson  tennessee  which we acquired earlier that year  lost a competitor s long standing challenge of the con originally granted in to provide interventional cardiology and open heart surgery services 
the challenge concluded with the voiding of the previously issued con and a discontinuation of those services 
the voiding of the con did not have a material adverse impact on our operations 
in addition  at the time we acquire a hospital  we may agree to replace or expand the facility we are acquiring 
if we are not able to obtain required prior approvals  we would not be able to acquire additional hospitals and expand the breadth of services we offer 
if we are unable to effectively compete for patients  local residents could use other hospitals 
the hospital industry is highly competitive 
in addition to the competition we face for acquisitions and physicians  we must also compete with other hospitals and healthcare providers for patients 
the competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years 
our hospitals are located in non urban service areas 
in approximately of our markets  we are the sole provider of general healthcare services 
in most of our other markets  the primary competitor is a not for profit hospital 
these not for profit hospitals generally differ in each jurisdiction 
however  our hospitals face competition from hospitals outside of their primary service area  including hospitals in urban areas that provide more complex services 
these facilities generally are located in excess of miles from our facilities 
patients in our primary service areas may travel to these other hospitals for a variety of reasons 
these reasons include physician referrals or the need for services we do not offer 
patients who seek services from these other hospitals may subsequently shift their preferences to those hospitals for the services we provide 
some of our hospitals operate in primary service areas where they compete with one other hospital 
one of our hospitals competes with more than one other hospital in its primary service area 
some of these competing hospitals use equipment and services more specialized than those available at our hospitals 
in addition  some competing hospitals are owned by tax supported governmental agencies or not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions 
these hospitals can make capital expenditures without paying sales  property and income taxes 
we also face competition from other specialized care providers  including outpatient surgery  orthopedic  oncology and diagnostic centers 
we expect that these competitive trends will continue 
our inability to compete effectively with other hospitals and other healthcare providers could cause local residents to use other hospitals 
the failure to obtain our medical supplies at favorable prices could cause our operating results to decline 
in  we entered into an affiliation agreement with broadlane  a group purchasing organization  or gpo  of which we are a minority owner 
gpos attempt to obtain favorable pricing on medical supplies with manufacturers and vendors who sometimes negotiate exclusive supply arrangements in exchange for the discounts they give 
recently  some vendors who are not gpo members have challenged these exclusive supply arrangements 
in addition  the us senate has held hearings with respect to gpos and these exclusive supply arrangements 
to the extent these exclusive supply arrangements are challenged or deemed unenforceable  we could incur higher costs for our medical supplies obtained through broadlane 
these higher costs could cause our operating results to decline 
in november  we determined to terminate our affiliation agreement with broadlane on march  thereafter  in january  we entered into a five year participation agreement with automatic renewal terms of one year each with healthtrust purchasing group  lp  a gpo 
there can be no assurance that our arrangement with healthtrust will provide the discounts we expect to achieve 
if the fair value of our reporting units declines  a material non cash charge to earnings from impairment of our goodwill could result 
affiliates of forstmann little co 
acquired our predecessor company in principally for cash 
we recorded a significant portion of the purchase price as goodwill 
we have also recorded as goodwill a portion of the purchase price for many of our subsequent hospital acquisitions 
at december   we had approximately billion of goodwill recorded on our books 
we expect to recover the carrying value of this goodwill through our future cash flows 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate  based on the fair value of our reporting units  whether the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired 
if the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired  we may incur a material non cash charge to earnings 
risks related to our industry if federal or state healthcare programs or managed care companies reduce the payments we receive as reimbursement for services we provide  our net operating revenues may decline 
in  of our net operating revenues came from the medicare and medicaid programs 
in recent years  federal and state governments made significant changes in the medicare and medicaid programs  including the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of some of these changes have decreased the amount of money we receive for our services relating to these programs 
in recent years  congress and some state legislatures have introduced an increasing number of other proposals to make major changes in the healthcare system 
future federal and state legislation may further reduce the payments we receive for our services 
for example  the governor of the state of tennessee recently announced plans to dissolve tenncare  a supplementary health care program for poor  disabled and elderly persons 
subsequently  the governor of the state of tennessee announced instead plans to cut costs in tenncare by restricting eligibility and capping specified services 
if implemented  these plans could reduce payments for our services provided in the state of tennessee 
in addition  insurance and managed care companies and other third parties from whom we receive payment for our services increasingly are attempting to control healthcare costs by requiring that hospitals discount payments for their services in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans 
we believe that this trend may continue and may reduce the payments we receive for our services 
if we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations  including fraud and abuse laws  we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
the healthcare industry is required to comply with many laws and regulations at the federal  state  and local government levels 
these laws and regulations require that hospitals meet various requirements  including those relating to the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  maintenance of adequate records  compliance with building codes  environmental protection and privacy 
these laws include the health insurance portability and accountability act of and a section of the social security act  known as the anti kickback statute 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  including fraud and abuse laws  we could suffer civil or criminal penalties  including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in the medicare  medicaid  and other federal and state healthcare programs 
in addition  there are heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state government agencies relating to the healthcare industry  including the hospital segment 
the ongoing investigations relate to various referral  cost reporting  and billing practices  laboratory and home healthcare services  and physician ownership and joint ventures involving hospitals 
in the future  different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs  and operating expenses 
a shortage of qualified nurses could limit our ability to grow and deliver hospital healthcare services in a cost effective manner 
hospitals are currently experiencing a shortage of nursing professionals  a trend which we expect to continue for some time 
if the supply of qualified nurses declines in the markets in which our hospitals operate  it may result in increased labor expenses and lower operating margins at those hospitals 
in  for example  our contract labor expense as a percentage of net operating revenue increased primarily as a result of the additional use of nursing related contract labor 
in addition  in some markets like california  there are requirements to maintain specified nurse staffing levels 
to the extent we cannot meet those levels  the healthcare services that we provide in these markets may be reduced 
if we become subject to significant legal actions  we could be subject to substantial uninsured liabilities or increased insurance costs 
in recent years  physicians  hospitals  and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice  product liability  or related legal theories 
many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs 
to protect us from the cost of these claims  we generally maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe to be appropriate for our operations 
however  our insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us or may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance 
the cost of malpractice and other liability insurance increased in by  in by and decreased in by 
of net operating revenue 
if these costs rise rapidly  our profitability could decline 
for a further discussion of our insurance coverage  see our discussion of professional liability insurance claims in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our senior secured credit facility which bears interest based on floating rates 
in order to manage the volatility relating to the market risk  we entered into interest rate swap agreements described under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
we do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in we utilize risk management procedures and controls in executing derivative financial instrument transactions 
we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations are used with the goal of mitigating a portion of the exposure when it is cost effective to do so 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million for  million for  and million for
