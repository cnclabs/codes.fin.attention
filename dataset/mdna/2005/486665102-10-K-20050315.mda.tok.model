the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 
overview components of revenues we seek to help clients improve their business and information technology it effectiveness 
in order to align our reporting with our strategic priorities  beginning january   we classified our service offerings into the following three categories outsourcing  development integration  and other it services 
these services were previously classified within our plan  build  and manage service offerings in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
below is a description of each of our service offerings outsourcing our outsourcing services include application and business process outsourcing  as well as ongoing maintenance related to development integration work for our healthcare solutions division 
our application outsourcing services help clients manage existing business systems more efficiently and more reliably  improving the performance of these applications while frequently reducing costs 
under our application outsourcing service offering  we assume responsibility for managing a client s business applications with the goal of instituting operational efficiencies that enhance flexibility  free up client personnel resources  and achieve higher user satisfaction 
we enter into large  long term contracts for the provision of application outsourcing services  which generally do not require any capital outlay by us 
these contracts usually span three to five years with the ability to renew 
we typically receive a fixed monthly fee in return for meeting or exceeding a contractually agreed upon service level 
however  because our customers typically have the ability to reduce services under their contracts  our monthly fees may be reduced from the stated contract amounts 
through our global delivery model we can offer customers the flexibility and economic advantage of allocating work among a variety of delivery options 
these include onsite at a client s facility  nearshore in halifax  nova scotia  and toronto  ontario  and offshore at one of our four development centers in india 
in  we extended our global network of advanced development centers with the opening of new facilities in toronto  ontario and hyderabad  india 
this integrated  highly flexible mix of cost effective onsite  nearshore  and offshore delivery is now a component of most of our new application outsourcing engagements 
the distribution of work across multiple locations is typically based on a client s cost  technology  and risk management requirements 
our successful track record in absorbing the local staff of our clients is particularly attractive to many prospective clients 
our business process outsourcing bpo services are provided by our majority owned subsidiary  worldzen  inc  now keane worldzen  inc 
keane worldzen  which we acquired on october  keane worldzen specializes in providing bpo services to clients with complex processes in the financial services  insurance  and healthcare industries  and to clients with back office processes in several industries 
keane worldzen s bpo services are designed to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of our clients business transactions  enabling companies to focus on their more profitable activities and avoid the distraction of non core back office processes 
keane worldzen provides these low cost  high value outsourcing services from operations in both the united states us and india 
development integration as application software becomes more complex  it requires sophisticated integration between front end and back end systems to enhance access to critical corporate data  enable process improvements  and improve customer service 
many of our development integration projects focus on solutions for the integration of enterprise applications  supply chain  and customer service problems 
we also provide development integration services to the public sector  which includes agencies within the us federal government  various states  and other local government entities 
additionally  our healthcare solutions division provides software solutions and integration support to both acute and long term care providers 
other it services other it services are primarily comprised of it consulting  project management  and supplemental staff engagements that are principally billed on a time and materials basis 
global economic and political conditions may cause companies to be cautious about increasing their use of consulting and it services  but we continue to see a demand for our services 
we continue to experience pricing pressure from competitors as well as from clients facing pressure to control costs 
in addition  the growing use of offshore resources to provide lower cost service delivery capabilities within our industry continues to be a source of pressure on revenues 
we also experience wage inflation  primarily in india  as the demand for those resources increases 
in order for us to remain successful in the near term  we must continue to maintain and grow our client base  provide high quality service and satisfaction to our existing clients  and take advantage of cross selling opportunities 
in the current economic environment  we must provide our clients with service offerings that are appropriately priced  satisfy their needs  and provide them with measurable business benefits 
while we have recently experienced a more steady demand for our services  and gross margin as a percentage of revenue has stabilized over the past two years  we believe that it is too early to determine if developments will translate into sustainable improvements in our pricing or margins for and over the longer term 
there is a great deal of competition in provision of outsourcing services 
we believe our evolving go to market strategy  where we seek to provide high value  repeatable business solutions to our clients  differentiates us from our competitors 
the solutions sets that we offer to our clients have five major elements 
they are first  they are vertically driven in that they are value propositions designed to address specific needs  challenges  or opportunities within a vertical industry 
second  they include application services  either in the form of applications development integration  or application outsourcing 
third  these solutions also involve a business process component  including process reengineering and business process outsourcing 
fourth  we seek to leverage a technology platform  either provided by a third party  or proprietary to keane  as well as keane intellectual capital  as a foundation for our solutions 
and finally  these solution sets nearly always incorporate our global delivery capabilities 
while  we are still in the early stages of implementing this new market approach  we believe that our deep industry knowledge will differentiate us from our competitors  allow us to go beyond simply delivering cost and performance improvements to our clients  and allow us to deliver transformational business benefits and ultimately  help grow our business and integrate our comprehensive capabilities 
components of operating expenses the primary categories of our operating expenses include salaries  wages  and other direct costs  selling  general and administrative expenses  and amortization of intangible assets 
salaries  wages  and other direct costs are primarily driven by the cost of client service personnel  which consists mainly of compensation  sub contractor  and other personnel costs  and other non payroll costs 
selling expenses are driven primarily by business development activities and client targeting  image development  and branding activities 
general and administrative expenses primarily include costs for non client facing personnel  information systems  and office space  which we seek to manage at levels consistent with changes in the activity levels in our business 
we continue to anticipate changes in demand for our services and to identify cost management initiatives to balance our mix of resources to meet current and projected future demand in our markets 
we will also continue to use our global sourcing as part of our cost effective delivery model 
we evaluate our improvement in profitability by comparing gross margins  and selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues 
other key metrics that we use to manage and evaluate the performance of our business include new contract bookings  the number of billable personnel  and utilization rates 
we calculate utilization rates by dividing the total billable hours per consultant by the total hours available  including sick  holiday  and vacation  from the consultant 
new contract bookings new contract bookings for the year ended december  were billion  an increase of million  or  over new bookings of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   outsourcing bookings increased to million  development integration bookings increased to million  and other it bookings increased to million compared to the same period in we provide information regarding our bookings because we believe it represents useful information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time 
however  information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to  nor should it be substituted for  an analysis of our revenues 
cancellations and or reductions in existing contracted amounts are not reflected in new contract bookings 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue earned but not yet billed  costs to complete fixed price projects  the collectibility of accounts receivable  acquisition accounting  the valuation of goodwill  certain accrued liabilities and other reserves  income taxes  and others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue as services are performed or products are delivered in accordance with contractual agreements and generally accepted accounting principles 
for general consulting engagements  we recognize revenue on a time and materials basis as services are delivered 
for the majority of our outsourcing engagements  we provide a specific level of service each month for which we bill a standard monthly fee 
we recognize revenue for these engagements in monthly installments over the billable portion of the contract 
these installments may be adjusted to reflect changes in staffing requirements and service levels consistent with terms of the contract 
costs of transitioning the employees may be capitalized over defined periods of time and amortized over the period in which the associated revenue is recognized 
for fixed price engagements  we recognize revenue on a proportional performance basis over the life of the contract 
we use estimated labor to complete to measure the proportional performance 
proportional performance recognition relies on accurate estimates of the cost  scope  and duration of each engagement 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  then future revenues may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
all future anticipated losses are recognized in the period they are identified 
we recognize revenue associated with application software products as the software products are installed and as implementation services are delivered 
we recognize software maintenance fees on installed products on a pro rated basis over the term of the agreement 
in multiple element arrangements  keane uses the residual value method in accordance with statement of position sop sop sop  software revenue recognition  and sop sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements which qualify for separate element accounting treatment is allocated to each undelivered element using the relative fair values of those elements based on vendor specific objective evidence with the remaining value assigned to the delivered element  the software license 
in all consulting engagements  outsourcing engagements  and software application sales  the risk of issues associated with satisfactory service delivery exists 
although we believe these risks are adequately addressed by our adherence to proven project management methodologies  proprietary frameworks  and internal project audits  the potential exists for future revenue charges relating to service delivery issues 
historically  we have not experienced major service delivery issues 
allowance for bad debts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
our allowance for bad debts is based upon specific identification of likely and probable losses 
each accounting period  we evaluate accounts receivable for risk associated with a client s inability to make contractual payments or unresolved issues with the adequacy of our services 
billed and unbilled receivables that are specifically identified as being at risk are provided for with a charge to revenue in the period the risk is identified 
we use considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of the client  evaluating the successful mitigation of service delivery disputes  and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluation of service delivery issues or a client s ability to pay is incorrect  we may incur future reductions to revenue 
business combinations in connection with acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
some of the items  including accounts receivable  property and equipment  other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities  and legal and other reserves require a high degree of management judgment 
certain estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
in particular  restructuring liabilities are subject to change as we complete our assessment of the acquired operations and finalize our integration plan 
valuation of goodwill we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
effective january   goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment test involves the use of estimates related to the fair value of the business operations with which the goodwill is associated 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
we estimate the fair value of the business operations using a discounted cash flow model based on the future annual operating plan of each reporting unit 
this model determines the present value of the estimated cash flows of the reporting unit 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income in our consolidated statement of income 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
as of december   our goodwill totaled million 
valuation of intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired business 
other intangible assets include  among other things  customer related assets such as order backlog  customer contracts  and customer relationships 
determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment  assumptions  and estimates 
in most situations  we use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
in addition  these intangible assets are amortized over the best estimate of their useful life 
we review our identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in determining whether an intangible asset is impaired  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset  and other related factors 
if the estimates or the related assumptions used to determine the value of the intangible assets change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
as of december   our intangible assets totaled million 
income taxes to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the tax benefits of certain subsidiary net operating losses and the minimum pension liability 
our policy is to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by the tax authorities 
in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  we establish the reserves based upon our assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences and interest expense applicable to both permanent and temporary difference adjustments 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjusted  as events occur to warrant the adjustment to the reserve 
if we determine that we will require more or less of our reserves in the future  such adjustment would be recorded as an increase or reduction of income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of income tax expense to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our tax returns  revision to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  the actual level of pre tax income  changes in tax rules  regulations  and rates  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
stock based compensation we grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the shares at the date of grant 
we also grant restricted stock for a fixed number of shares to employees for nominal consideration 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment to sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
as permitted by sfas and sfas  we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
in accordance with apb  we recognize compensation expense based on the difference between the market value at grant date and the grant price and record the compensation expense ratably over the restriction period 
we do not recognize compensation expense on our stock option grants as the stock options are granted at the market price at the date of grant 
had expense been recognized using the fair value method described in sfas  using the black scholes option pricing model  we would have recorded additional compensation expense and reduced net income by approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
see recent accounting pronouncements for discussion on sfas no 
revised sfas r share based payment  which was issued in december and is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb and its related implementation guidance 
restructuring we have recorded restructuring charges and reserves associated with restructuring plans approved by management in the last six years 
as of january   we adopted sfas no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires us to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to exit or disposal plan exists 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and real estate lease obligations 
the reserve associated with lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as the ability to obtain subleases  the creditworthiness of our sub lessees  market value of properties  and the ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors 
while we believe that our current estimates regarding lease obligations are adequate  future events could require adjustments to these estimates 
based on the assumptions included in our analysis as of december   to the extent that we are unable to maintain all of our current  contractual subleases  we could incur an additional restructuring charge up to approximately million 
in addition  if we are able to negotiate early terminations of our operating leases or to obtain a sublessee  we would record a reduction to the restructuring liability and a corresponding expense reduction 
in and  we recorded an expense reduction of million and million  respectively  associated with early lease terminations and unanticipated subleases 
accrued compensation and other liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have a number of different variable compensation programs  which are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often  actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after we report our results 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
we also estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience and actual amounts may vary from these estimates 
in addition  with respect to our potential exposure to losses from litigation  claims and other assessments  we record a liability when such amounts are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we have a foreign defined benefit plan that provides pension benefits to employees of our subsidiary located in the uk  uk dbp 
assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our uk dbp are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost projections  are evaluated and updated annually 
we have assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
this rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits  and changes as long term interest rates change 
at december   we determined this rate to be 
during  we closed the uk dbp to future salary accruals effective april  accordingly  we accounted for the closing of the uk dbp as a curtailment under sfas no 
sfas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
as a result  we recorded a curtailment loss of approximately million to expense the unrecognized prior service cost  and we recorded an additional required minimum pension liability of approximately million as a non cash adjustment through accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the minimum pension liability was million and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
see note benefit plans in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
consolidated results of operations compared to revenues dollars in thousands years ended december  increase decrease outsourcing    development integration    other it services    total    revenues revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  revenues in increased compared to due primarily to the growth in outsourcing services and revenues from our acquired businesses 
we completed our acquisition of nims associates  inc nims  an it and consulting services company with offices in the midwest  on february   and as a result  the operating results of nims have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning march  in addition  we completed the acquisition of fast track holdings limited fast track on july   and have included its operating results in our consolidated financial statements beginning july  fast track was a privately held consulting firm based in the united kingdom that manages the design  integration  and rapid deployment of large scale sap implementations 
outsourcing 
outsourcing service revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase in outsourcing service revenues was primarily due to increased revenues from large outsourcing contracts  as well as the revenues generated by nims 
pacificare  one of our largest clients  has reduced the level of service from the stated baseline contract amounts in accordance with its right under the contract terms  thereby reducing the contract value 
during the second quarter ended june   pacificare requested that we further reduce service levels to levels below the minimums provided in our contract 
the requested change was not consistent with the terms of our contract with pacificare and would have resulted in a reduction in our monthly billings to pacificare 
accordingly  we did not agree to this change 
since then  through the year ended on december   we have continued providing services at or above the minimum levels set forth in the contract 
in accordance with the contract terms  we and pacificare jointly engaged an independent third party to conduct a study to compare our billing rates with benchmark rates 
the results assert that our rates are higher than the benchmark rates 
to the extent that the lower rates identified in the study would go in effect in the second quarter of  our annual revenues and operating income would decline 
we have thirty days to evaluate the results of the study and expect that we will enter into discussions with pacificare thereafter 
development integration 
development integration service revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  partly due to the revenues associated with the acquisition of fast track in the third quarter ended september  other it services 
other it services revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  during the second quarter ended june  we agreed to a price reduction for one of our large customers and mitigated the impact of that price reduction on gross margin by negotiating lower pricing of our subcontractor personnel 
additionally  this customer also notified us in the fourth quarter of that they would be reducing their purchasing requirements  which will have an impact of reducing annual revenues by approximately million to million in from that customer 
in addition  a large client in the uk has notified us that they would be reducing their purchasing requirements  which will have an impact of reducing annual revenue by approximately million to million in the following table summarizes certain line items from our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands years ended december  increase decrease revenues    salaries  wages  and other direct costs gross margin    gross margin salaries  wages  and other direct costs salaries  wages  and other direct costs for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to costs of client service personnel to support the increased service revenues as well as an increase in direct costs to support the revenues generated by our acquired nims business 
salaries  wages  and other direct costs were of total revenues for the year ended december  compared to of total revenues for the year ended december  total billable employees for all operations were  as of december   compared to  total billable employees as of december  this includes a base of billable employees within our india operations of  which represents an increase of employees  or  over the year ended december  we added our india operation in march with our acquisition of signaltree solutions 
in addition  total billable employees include a base of billable employees within our keane worldzen operations 
we acquired our controlling interest in keane worldzen in october in addition to these employees  we occasionally use subcontract personnel to augment our billable staff  which represented subcontractors as of december  overall utilization rates for all three periods remained stable as we increased the number of billable employees 
gross margin our management believes gross margin revenues less salaries  wages  and other direct costs provides an important measure of our profitability 
gross margin for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  although gross margin for the year ended december  decreased by approximately basis points compared to the year ended december   we believe that the relatively constant gross margin percentage over the past two years is indicative of a more stable environment for it services  and firmer utilization rates  as well as the benefit of our global delivery capabilities 
the lower labor cost associated with the increased use of offshore resources at our india facilities helped reduce the impact of lower pricing of our services on gross margin 
we continue to closely monitor utilization rates and other direct costs in an effort to avoid adverse impacts on our gross margin 
selling  general  and administrative expenses years ended december  increase selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a   sg a as a of revenue sg a expenses include salaries for our corporate and branch administrative employees  sales and marketing expenses  as well as the cost of our administrative facilities  including related depreciation expense 
sg a expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase in sg a expenses was due to higher compensation costs in compared to  resulting from higher headcount associated with our acquired business  keane worldzen in the fourth quarter ended december   nims in the first quarter ended march  and fast track in the third quarter ended september  also contributing to the increase in sg a expenses were higher costs associated with the growth of our india operations 
sg a expenses for the year ended december  were of total revenues  as compared to of total revenues for the year ended december  the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue in was due in part to the acquisition of nims  the integration of the operations of nims  and increasing revenues 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the amortization of intangible assets for increased million due to the additional intangible assets resulting from our nims acquisition in the first quarter ended march  and  to a lesser extent  our fast track acquisition in the third quarter ended september  these amounts were offset in part by certain intangibles that have become fully amortized 
restructuring charges  net during the fourth quarter of  we reevaluated our estimates recorded for the restructuring charge taken in and and as a result recorded an expense reduction of million and a charge of million  resulting in a net expense reduction of million 
during  we reevaluated our estimates recorded for the restructuring charge taken in and as a result recorded an expense reduction of million for workforce reductions  and million related to the costs of consolidating and or closing certain non profitable offices 
in addition  during we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
of this charge  million was for an additional workforce reduction of employees and million was for the costs associated with a branch office closing 
the net impact of these actions resulted in a net expense reduction to the restructuring charge of  in our consolidated statement of income 
interest and dividend income interest and dividend income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest and dividend income was the result of higher average cash balances and marketable securities 
the higher average cash balances and marketable securities was due to the investment of the net proceeds from the issuance of our convertible subordinate debentures due debentures issued in june and strong cash flow  offset in part by the impact of our share repurchases during and the year ended december  to the extent we use our cash and marketable securities to fund acquisitions  our operations  and capital investments  our interest income will decline in future periods 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily related to a full year of interest recognized on our debentures and the imputed interest expense on the accrued building costs as a result of our occupation of our corporate facility 
as explained in note related parties  commitments  and contingencies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the accounting for the facility requires us to impute interest expense on the accrued building costs 
other expense income  net other expense  net was million for the year ended december  and other income  net was million for the year ended december  other income  net during the first quarter of included a million  million after tax  favorable judgment in an arbitration award proceeding related to damages for breach of an agreement between signal corporation and our federal systems subsidiary 
minority interest during the fourth quarter of  we completed our acquisition of a controlling interest in keane worldzen  a privately held bpo firm 
our initial investment resulted in an equity position of approximately of the issued and outstanding capital stock of keane worldzen with the right to increase our ownership position over time 
as a result of this transaction  we began to consolidate keane worldzen s financial results with ours in the fourth quarter of the amount in minority interest represents the loss attributable to minority shareholders for the period that we consolidated keane worldzen 
income taxes the provision for income taxes represents the amounts owed for federal  state  and foreign taxes 
our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  the determination of the provision for income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance involves judgment 
as a global company  we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions where we operate 
this involves making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets  which can affect the overall effective tax rate 
in addition  changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of pre tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate 
during the third quarter ended september   certain events occurred  which impacted our tax provision 
these events include the expiration of certain state statutes and changes in estimates  which resulted in a reduction to our tax provision of approximately million  and the enactment of certain tax laws  which resulted in an imposition of tax retroactive to january  and that resulted in an increase to our tax provision of approximately million 
the net impact of these events was a reduction of our tax provision by approximately million 
in accordance with sfas and sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  we adjusted our tax reserves in the period where the conditions under sfas were no longer met and as of the enactment date of the new tax laws 
for the year ended december   the company identified errors relating to deferred tax balances arising from transactions in prior years 
as a result  an adjustment to reduce goodwill by approximately million has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  with a corresponding reduction to deferred tax liabilities 
furthermore  as of december   the company recorded an adjustment to record an additional deferred tax asset totaling approximately million and a corresponding decrease to the provision for income taxes 
this income tax adjustment results from book to tax timing differences related to depreciation expense that management believes relate to a period  or periods prior to since the specific period to which this adjustment relates cannot be identified with certainty  the adjustment has been recorded in the year ended december  net income net income for the year ended december  was million higher compared to the year ended december  the increase is due to higher income before taxes and the lower effective tax rate for the year ended december  compared to revenues dollars in thousands years ended december  increase decrease outsourcing    development integration    other it services    total    revenues revenues in compared to decreased as a result of clients decisions to continue to defer discretionary technology related expenditures during a period of economic uncertainty 
however  throughout the course of the year  we experienced a more stable demand for our services and believe that we are beginning to see some indications of increases in discretionary it spending 
outsourcing 
outsourcing service revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase in outsourcing service revenues was primarily due to increased revenues from large outsourcing contracts 
development integration 
development integration service revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  development and integration service revenues were adversely affected during by customers decisions to defer software development projects due to the reduction in capital spending related to technology 
other it services 
other it services revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december   largely due to lower revenues associated with staff augmentation and other services 
the following table summarizes certain line items from our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands years ended december  increase decrease revenues    salaries  wages  and other direct costs gross margin    gross margin salaries  wages  and other direct costs the decrease in salaries  wages  and other direct costs in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to ongoing efforts to bring our costs in alignment with anticipated revenues through workforce reductions and increased offshore staffing  primarily at our india facilities 
salaries  wages  and other direct costs were million  or  of total revenues  for and million  or  of total revenues in total billable employees for all operations were  at the end of  compared to  total billable employees at the end of in addition to these employees  we occasionally use subcontractors to augment our billable staff 
the base of billable employees within our india operation was at the end of  an increase of employees  or  compared to we added our india operation in march with our acquisition of signaltree solutions 
we closely monitor utilization rates  billable employees  and other direct costs in an effort to avoid adverse impacts to our gross margin 
gross margin we believe gross margin revenues less salaries  wages  and other direct costs provides an important measure of our profitability 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue for was  compared to in the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was largely the result of a more stable environment for it services and improved utilization related to our base of billable personnel in north america 
also contributing to the improvement in the gross margin percentage was our lower labor cost due to increased use of offshore resources at our india facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses years ended december  decrease selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a   sg a as a of revenue sg a expenses include salaries for our corporate and branch administrative employees  sales and marketing expenses  as well as the cost of our administrative facilities  including related depreciation expense 
sg a expenses for decreased million  or  compared to sg a expenses for were million  or  of total revenue  compared to million  or  of total revenue for the decrease in sg a expenses in was the result of our fourth quarter of workforce reduction  our continued focus on tightly controlling discretionary expenses  and the cost synergies of fully integrating the acquisitions that we made in and amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the decrease in amortization of intangible assets in was primarily due to fully amortizing intangibles associated with prior year acquisitions offset in part by the full year amortization of additional intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of signaltree solutions in march and one other acquisition complementary to our business strategy made during the third quarter of restructuring charges  net during  we reevaluated our estimates recorded for the restructuring charge taken in and as a result recorded an expense reduction of million for workforce reductions  and million related to the costs of consolidating and or closing certain non profitable offices 
in addition  during we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
of this charge  million was for an additional workforce reduction of employees and million was for the costs associated with a branch office closing 
the net impact of these actions resulted in a net expense reduction to the restructuring charge of  in our consolidated statement of income 
during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
this charge consisted of million related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees  million for branch office closings and certain other expenditures  million of assets which became impaired as a result of these restructuring actions  and million for a net change in the prior year s estimate for workforce reductions  branch office closures  and other expenditures 
interest and dividend income interest and dividend income for was million compared to million in the increase in interest and dividend income was the result of higher average cash balances and marketable securities offset in part by overall lower interest rates compared to the same period in the higher average cash balances and marketable securities was due to the investment of the net proceeds from the issuance of debentures in june and our strong cash flow 
our cash balances were reduced by cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in interest expense interest expense for was million compared to  in the interest expense increase is primarily related to the issuance of our debentures and our new corporate facility 
the accounting for the facility as explained in note related parties  commitments  and contingencies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  requires us to impute interest expense on the accrued building costs 
other income  net other income was million for compared to million in other income in included a million payment received for a favorable judgment in an arbitration award proceeding related to damages for breach of an agreement between signal corporation and our federal systems subsidiary 
minority interest during the fourth quarter of  we completed our acquisition of a controlling interest in keane worldzen  a privately held bpo firm 
our initial investment resulted in an equity position of approximately of the issued and outstanding capital stock of keane worldzen with the right to increase our ownership position over time 
as a result of this transaction  we began to consolidate keane worldzen s financial results with ours in the fourth quarter of the amount in minority interest represents the loss attributable to minority shareholders for the period that we consolidated worldzen 
income taxes we generated income before taxes of million for compared to million in the provision for income taxes represents the amounts owed for federal  state  and foreign taxes 
the effective income tax rate is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before the provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for and  and reflects an adjustment of prior year s estimated tax liability in and a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective rate for each period is included in note income taxes in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net income net income increased to million in compared to million in the improvement in net income is the result of the absence of a restructuring charge in  improved operating income margins  and the favorable judgment in an arbitration award in recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  as amended by fasb interpretation no 
r fin r  which requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity  as defined  by its primary beneficiary 
primary beneficiaries are those companies that are subject to a majority of the risk of loss or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
in determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  an entity with a variable interest shall treat variable interests in that same entity held by its related parties as its own interests 
fin r is effective prospectively for all variable interests obtained subsequent to december  for variable interests existing prior to december   consolidation is required for periods ending after march   with the exception of interests in special purpose entities  which were required in financial statements of public companies for periods ending after december  we have evaluated the applicability of fin r to our relationship with each of city square limited partnership city square and gateway llc and determined that these entities are not required to be consolidated within our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
we have determined that gateway llc is not a variable interest entity as the equity investment is sufficient to absorb the expected losses and the holders of the equity investment do not lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest 
we have concluded that as we no longer occupy the space at ten city square and no longer derive any benefit from leasing the space  we would not be determined to be the related party most closely associated with city square 
as a result  we will continue to account for our leases with city square and gateway llc consistent with our historical practices in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that we do not have an interest in any variable interest entities that would require consolidation 
in may  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease 
eitf provides guidance on how to determine whether an arrangement contains a lease that is within the scope of sfas no 
sfas  accounting for leases 
the guidance in eitf is based on whether the arrangement conveys to the purchaser lessee the right to use a specific asset 
eitf is effective for arrangements entered into or modified in the second quarter of the adoption of this statement did not have a significant effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas as revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits 
this statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans but does not change the measurement or recognition provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits and sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
sfas as revised requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans 
this statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december   except the additional disclosure information about foreign plans is effective for fiscal years ending after june  we have a foreign defined benefit plan and  as a result  have included the required additional disclosures in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in march  the eitf reached consensuses on issue no 
eitf  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  which requires that convertible participating securities should be included in the computation of basic earnings per share using the two class method 
our debentures are not participating securities under the provisions of eitf as they do not participate in undistributed earnings with our common stock 
no separate disclosure of basic or diluted earnings per share has been made for the class b common stock as the impact was immaterial and  effective february   all of the class b common stock was converted into shares of our common stock 
in addition  there was no impact on the basic and diluted earnings per share for our common stock for all periods presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income 
see note capital stock in the notes to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure 
in september  the eitf reached consensus on issue no 
eitf  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  which requires that contingently convertible debt should be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share using the if converted method regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
under the if converted method  the debt is considered converted to shares  with the resulting number of shares included in the denominator of the earnings per share calculation and the related interest expense net of tax added back to the numerator of the earnings per share calculation 
see note earnings per share data in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure 
in accordance with this issue  we have adopted the consensus as of december  and have restated all prior periods presented 
the adoption of eitf resulted in a reduction of diluted earnings per share for the years ended december  and  but did not have any impact on diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  as our debentures were issued in in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r share based payment  which is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb and its related implementation guidance 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r is effective for public companies excluding small business issuer as defined in sec regulation s b at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have yet to determine which method we will use in adopting sfas r 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we are evaluating sfas r and have not yet determined the impact in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated financial condition dollars in thousands years ended december  cash flows provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    effect of exchange rate on cash  increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   we have historically financed our operations with cash generated from operations 
in addition  we raised million in proceeds from the issuance of our debentures 
we use the net cash generated from these sources to fund capital expenditures  mergers and acquisitions  and stock repurchases 
if we were to experience a decrease in revenue as a result of a decrease in demand for our services or a decrease in our ability to collect receivables  we would be required to reduce discretionary spending related to sg a expenses and adjust our workforce in an effort to maintain profitability 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we intend to continue to use our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities for general corporate purposes  which may include additional repurchases of our common stock under existing or future share repurchase programs and the funding of future acquisitions and other corporate transactions 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in as compared to net cash provided by operations of million in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven in part by the absence of a million payment that we received in connection with an arbitration proceeding in the first quarter of  million of higher tax payments during and higher working capital requirements due to the timing of payroll and subcontractor costs 
accounts receivable increased million to million in compared to the accounts receivable increase was largely driven by the revenue growth experienced in however  day sales outstanding dso  an indicator of the effectiveness of our accounts receivable collections  was days as of december  compared to days as of december  and days as of december  we calculate dso using the trailing three months total revenues divided by the number of days in the quarter to determine daily revenues 
the average accounts receivable balance for the three month period is then divided by daily revenues 
changes in accounts receivable have a significant effect on our cash flow 
items that can affect our accounts receivable dso include  contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management  fluctuations in the level of it product sales and our level of collection efforts 
many individual reasons are outside of our control 
as a result  our dso will normally fluctuate from period to period affecting our liquidity 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased million compared to due to higher net income and improvements in working capital 
we drove the improvements in working capital through our continuing efforts to increase collections of accounts receivable 
the improvement in collections is evident by a reduction in dso 
cash provided by operating activities also improved due to a million award that we received in the first quarter of this award was the result of an arbitration proceeding that we initiated in for a breach of an agreement between signal corporation and our federal systems subsidiary 
partially offsetting this increase is approximately million that we paid associated with prior and current restructuring charges and million that we paid in connection with settling a legal claim in the third quarter of during  we paid million associated with prior and current restructuring charges 
we believe that cash generated from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements through the next months and beyond 
however  in order to protect against the current economic conditions persisting in and beyond  we have taken and will continue to take  as we deem necessary  steps to reduce our expenses and align our cost structure to our revenue 
we anticipate that current cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund our planned capital and financing expenditures for the next months and beyond 
cash flows used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in each of   and was primarily for investments  acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
during  we purchased million and sold million in marketable securities  generating a net source of cash of million 
in addition  we invested million in property and equipment  and capitalized software costs in connection with the implementation of our peoplesoft enterprise resource planning applications in on february   we acquired nims  an information technology and consulting services company 
we paid million in cash  including transaction costs and net of cash acquired  for all of the outstanding capital stock of nims 
the purchase price may increase with the potential to pay up to an additional million in earn out consideration over the next three years  contingent upon the achievement of certain future financial targets 
based on the forecasted financial performance related to the first earn out  we expect to pay approximately million contingent consideration in april of on july   we acquired fast track  a privately held consulting firm based in the united kingdom that manages the design  integration  and rapid deployment of large scale sap implementations 
in exchange for all of fast track s outstanding capital stock  we paid approximately million in cash  including transactions costs  with the potential to pay up to approximately million  additionally  in earn out consideration over the next two years  contingent upon the achievement of certain future financial targets 
during  we purchased million and sold million in marketable securities  generating a net use of cash of million 
in addition  we invested million on property and equipment  and capitalized software costs in connection with the implementation of our peoplesoft enterprise resource planning applications 
we also invested million  net of cash acquired  for the controlling interest in keane worldzen and paid million related to prior year s acquisitions 
during  we purchased million and sold million in marketable securities  generating net cash of million  which we used to partially fund acquisitions 
in  we paid million  net of cash acquired  to acquire signaltree solutions  and another smaller business that is complementary to our business strategy 
in connection with the smaller complementary business acquisition  we recorded million as deferred revenue related to contingent service credits and issued a million non interest bearing note payable as partial consideration 
as of december   the deferred revenue and non interest bearing note each had a balance of million  which reflects an aggregate reduction of million resulting from the delivery of related service credits 
the note had a one year term with a one year extension expiring on september  effective september   the term of the contingent service credits was extended one year through september  during  we also invested million on property and equipment  and capitalized software costs in connection with the implementation of our peoplesoft enterprise resource planning applications 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities net cash flows used for financing activities was million in compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of million in net cash flows used for financing activities were primarily for the repurchase of our common stock 
in june  we received million in proceeds from our issuance of convertible subordinated debentures 
from these proceeds  we simultaneously invested approximately million to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock from authorizations approved by our board of directors in october of and may of net proceeds after the repurchase of shares and approximately million debt issuance costs were approximately million 
see note convertible subordinated debentures in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on our debentures 
additionally during and  we were authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in negotiated transactions  with the timing and amount of shares purchased determined by our management based on its evaluation of market and economic conditions and other factors 
from january  through december   our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
the following is a summary of our repurchase activity for   and dollars in thousands shares amount shares amount shares amount prior year authorizations at january    authorizations    repurchases      expirations  shares remaining as of december    between may and december   we have invested approximately million to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock under ten separate authorizations 
these share repurchases more than offset the shares issued under our various stock ownership programs 
under these stock ownership programs  we issued  shares   shares  and  shares and received proceeds of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in february  we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility with two banks 
the credit facility replaced a previous million demand line of credit  which expired in july the terms of the credit facility require us to maintain a maximum total funded debt and other financial ratios 
the credit facility also includes covenants that  subject to certain specific exceptions and limitations  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional debt  make certain acquisitions or disposition of assets  create liens  and pay dividends 
on june   we and the two banks amended certain provisions of the credit facility relating to financial covenants 
these covenants  which include total indebtedness and leverage ratios  are no more restrictive than those initially contained in the credit facility 
on october  and february   we and the two banks further amended certain provisions of the credit facility to expand our ability to make certain acquisitions 
the annual commitment fee for maintaining the credit facility is basis points on the unused portion of the credit facility  up to a maximum of  as of december   we had no debt outstanding under the credit facility 
we may draw upon the credit facility up to million less any outstanding letters of credit that have been issued against the credit facility 
any amounts drawn upon the credit facility constitute senior indebtedness for purposes of our debentures 
borrowings bear interest at one of the bank s base rate or the euro currency reserve rate 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  marketable securities  cash flows from operations  and our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our current capital requirements for at least the next months 
net cash used in financing activities in was primarily the result of our share repurchase program 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total investment of approximately million at an average per share price of  which was partially offset by million in cash proceeds from our various stock ownership programs

contractual obligations related to operating leases reflect existing rental leases and the corporate facility as discussed in note related parties  commitments  and contingencies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
further discussion regarding our debentures can be found in note convertible subordinated debentures 
seasonality we experience a moderate amount of seasonality 
our consulting revenue and profitability are affected by the number of workdays in a quarter 
typically our billable hours are reduced in the second half of the year  especially during the fourth quarter  due to the large number of holidays and vacation time 
off balance sheet arrangements in january  the fasb issued fin  which requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity  as defined  by its primary beneficiary 
primary beneficiaries are those companies that are subject to a majority of the risk of loss or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
in determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  an entity with a variable interest shall treat variable interests in that same entity held by its related parties as its own interests 
fin is effective prospectively for all variable interests obtained subsequent to december  for variable interests existing prior to december   consolidation will be required beginning july  in december  the fasb agreed to a broad based deferral of the effective date of fin for public companies until the end of periods ending after march   with the exception of interests in special purpose entities  which are required in financial statements of public companies for periods ending after december  we have evaluated the applicability of fin to our relationship with each of city square and gateway llc and determined that these entities are not required to be consolidated within our consolidated financial statements 
we have determined that gateway llc is not a variable interest entity as the equity investment is sufficient to absorb the expected losses and the holders of the equity investment do not lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest 
we have concluded that as we no longer occupy the space at ten city square and no longer derive any benefit from leasing the space  we would not be determined to be the related party most closely associated with city square 
as a result  we will continue to account for our leases with city square and gateway llc consistent with our historical practices in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that we do not have an interest in any variable interest entities that would require consolidation 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the statement requires a guarantor to record certain guarantees at fair value and to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote 
the interpretation and its disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the interpretation s initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  under fin  the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees issued prior to december  will not be revised or restated 
we are a guarantor with respect to a line of credit for innovate ec  an entity in which we acquired a minor equity position as a result of a previous acquisition 
the total line of credit is for  we guarantee  of this obligation 
the line is subject to review by the lending institution 
we would be required to meet our guarantor obligation in the event the lending institution refuses to extend the credit facility and innovate ec is unable to satisfy its obligation 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflationary increases in costs have not been material in recent years and  to the extent permitted by competitive pressures  are passed on to clients through increased billing rates 
rates charged by us are based on the cost of labor and market conditions within the industry 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
our quarterly operating results have varied  and are likely to continue to vary significantly 
this may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results 
our gross margins vary based on a variety of factors including employee utilization rates and the number and type of services performed during a particular period 
a variety of factors influence our revenue in a particular quarter  including general economic conditions  which may influence investment decisions or cause downsizing  the number and requirements of client engagements  employee utilization rates  changes in the rates we can charge clients for services  acquisitions  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
a significant portion of our expenses does not vary relative to revenue 
as a result  if revenue in a particular quarter does not meet expectations  our operating results could be materially adversely affected  which in turn may have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  many of our engagements are terminable without client penalty 
an unanticipated termination of a major project could result in an increase in underutilized employees and a decrease in revenue and profits 
we continue to position ourselves to achieve increasing percentages of revenues and growth through outsourcing 
if we are successful in obtaining new outsourcing contracts  we may experience increased pressure on our overall margins during the early stages of these contracts 
this could result in higher concentrations of revenues and contributions to income from a smaller number of larger clients on customized outsourcing solutions 
if we were to receive a higher concentration of our revenues from a smaller number of clients  our revenues could decrease significantly if one or more of these clients decreased their spending 
outsourcing contracts are generally long term contracts that require additional staffing in the initial phases of the contract period  which often results in lower gross margins at the beginning of these contracts 
if our clients are not satisfied with our services  we may have exposure to liabilities  which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition as well as our ability to compete for future work 
if we fail to meet our contractual obligations  we could be subject to legal liability  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the provisions we typically include in our contracts that are designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services and the applications we develop may not protect us or may not be enforceable under some circumstances or under the laws of some jurisdictions 
it is possible  because of the nature of our business  that we will be sued in the future 
in addition  although we maintain professional liability insurance  the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities 
moreover  as a consulting firm  we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high quality services to retain and attract clients and employees 
as a result  claims made against our work may damage our reputation  which in turn  could impact our ability to compete for new work and negatively impact our revenue and profitability 
the termination of a contract by a significant client could reduce our revenue and profitability or adversely affect our financial condition 
our five largest clients  excluding the federal government accounted for approximately of our revenue in  while no individual client accounted for more than of our total revenue 
the various agencies of the federal government represent our largest client  accounting for of total revenue in we strive to develop long term relationships with our clients 
most individual client assignments are from three to twelve months  however  many of our client relationships have continued for many years 
our clients typically retain us on a non exclusive  engagement by engagement basis 
although they may be subject to penalty provisions  clients may generally cancel a contract at any time 
under many contracts  clients may reduce their use of our services under such contract without penalty 
in addition  contracts with the federal government contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide the federal government with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts 
among other things  governments may terminate contracts with short notice  for convenience and may cancel multi year contracts if funds become unavailable 
when contracts are terminated  our revenue may decline and if we are unable to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner  our profitability may decline 
in  approximately of our revenue was from public sector clients  including us federal  state  and local governments and agencies 
often government spending programs are dependent upon the budgetary capability to support such programs 
many government budgets have been adversely impacted by the economic slowdown 
most states must operate under a balanced budget 
as a result of such budget and deficit considerations  our existing and future revenues and profitability could be adversely affected by reduced government it spending 
unfavorable government audits could require us to refund payments we have received  to forego anticipated revenue and could subject us to penalties and sanctions 
the government agencies we contract with generally have the authority to audit and review our contracts with them 
as part of that process  the government agency reviews our performance on the contract  our pricing practices  our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if the audit agency determines that we have improperly received reimbursement  we would be required to refund any such amount 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities by us or we otherwise determine that these activities have occurred  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government 
any such unfavorable determination could adversely impact our ability to bid for new work 
we have pursued  and intend to continue to pursue  strategic acquisitions 
failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets may adversely affect our financial performance 
in recent years  we have grown significantly through acquisitions 
from january  through december   we have completed acquisitions 
the aggregate merger and consideration costs of these acquisitions totaled approximately million 
our future growth may be based in part on selected acquisitions 
at any given time  we may be in various stages of considering acquisition opportunities 
we may not be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into a definitive agreement with any one target 
in addition  even if we reach a definitive agreement with a target  we may not be able to complete any future acquisition 
we typically anticipate that each acquisition will bring benefits  such as an increase in revenue 
prior to completing an acquisition  however  it is difficult to determine if these benefits will be realized 
accordingly  there is a risk that an acquired company may not achieve an increase in revenue or other benefits for us 
in addition  an acquisition may result in unexpected costs  expenses  and liabilities 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the process of integrating acquired companies into our existing business might also result in unforeseen difficulties 
unforeseen operating difficulties may absorb significant management attention  which we may otherwise devote to our existing business 
in addition  the process may require significant financial resources that we might otherwise allocate to other activities  including the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
finally  future acquisitions could result in our having to incur additional debt and or contingent liabilities 
we may also issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions  which could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
any of these possibilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and result of operations 
we face significant competition for our services  and our failure to remain competitive could limit our ability to maintain existing clients or attract new clients 
the market for our services is highly competitive 
the technology for custom software services can change rapidly 
the market is fragmented  and no company holds a dominant position 
consequently  our competition for client assignments and experienced personnel varies significantly from city to city and by the type of service provided 
some of our competitors are larger and have greater technical  financial  and marketing resources and greater name recognition in the markets they serve than we do 
in addition  clients may elect to increase their internal information systems resources to satisfy their custom software development and integration needs 
in the healthcare software systems market  we compete with some companies that are larger in the healthcare market and have greater financial resources than we do 
we believe that significant competitive factors in the healthcare software systems market include size and demonstrated ability to provide service to targeted healthcare markets 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we conduct business in the uk  canada  and india  which exposes us to a number of difficulties inherent in international activities 
as a result of our acquisition of a controlling interest in keane worldzen in october and the acquisition of signaltree solutions in march  we now have four software development facilities in india 
as of december   we had approximately  technical professionals in the region  including keane worldzen 
india is currently experiencing conflicts with pakistan over the disputed territory of kashmir as well as clashes between different religious groups within the country 
these conflicts  in addition to other unpredictable developments in the political  economic  and social conditions in india  could eliminate or reduce the availability of these development and professional services 
if access to these services were to be unexpectedly eliminated or significantly reduced  our ability to meet development objectives important to our strategy to add offshore delivery capabilities to the services we provide would be hindered  and our business could be harmed 
if we fail to manage our geographically dispersed organization  we may fail to meet or exceed our financial objectives and our revenues may decline 
we perform development activities in the us  canada  and india  and have offices throughout the us  uk  canada  and india 
this geographic dispersion requires us to devote substantial management resources that locally based competitors do not need to devote to their operations 
our operations in the uk  canada  and india are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations  foreign exchange restrictions  changes in taxation  and other difficulties in managing operations overseas 
we may not be successful in managing our international operations 
in addition  there has been political discussion and debate related to worldwide competitive sourcing  particularly from the united states to offshore locations 
there is proposed federal and state legislation currently pending related to this issue 
it is too early to determine whether or in what form this legislation will be adopted  however  future legislation  if enacted  could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to re deploy our professionals effectively if engagements are terminated unexpectedly  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
our clients can cancel or reduce the scope of their engagements with us on short notice 
if they do so  we may be unable to reassign our professionals to new engagements without delay 
the cancellation or reduction in scope of an engagement could  therefore  reduce the utilization rate of our professionals  which would have a negative impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as a result of these and other factors  our past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and we expect that our results of operations may fluctuate from period to period in the future 
our growth could be limited if we are unable to attract and retain personnel in the information technology and business consulting industries 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical and management personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not succeed in attracting and retaining the personnel necessary to develop our business 
if we do not  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may be prohibited from repurchasing  and may not have the financial resources to repurchase  our debentures on the date for repurchase at the option of the holder or upon a designated event  as required by the indenture governing our debentures  which could cause defaults under our senior revolving credit facility and any other indebtedness we may incur in the future 
the debenture holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures on june  the debenture holders may also require us to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures upon a designated event  as defined in the indenture governing the debentures 
if the debenture holders elect to require us to repurchase their debentures on any of the above dates or if a designated event were to occur  we may not have enough funds to pay the repurchase price for all tendered debentures 
we are currently prohibited under our senior revolving credit facility from repurchasing any debentures if a designated event were to occur 
we may also be prohibited under any indebtedness we may incur in the future from purchasing any debentures prior to their stated maturity 
in these circumstances  we will be required to repay all of the outstanding principal of  and pay any accrued and unpaid interest on  such indebtedness or to obtain the requisite consents from the holders of any such indebtedness to permit the repurchase of the debentures 
if we are unable to repay all of such indebtedness or are unable to obtain the necessary consents  we will be unable to offer to repurchase the debentures  which would constitute an event of default under the indenture for the debentures  which itself could constitute a default under our senior revolving credit facility or under the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 
in addition  the events that constitute a designated event under the indenture for the debentures are events of default under our senior revolving credit facility and may also be events of default under other indebtedness that we may incur in the future 
we incurred indebtedness when we sold our debentures 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
the indebtedness created by the sale of our debentures  and any future indebtedness  could adversely affect our business and our ability to make full payment on the debentures 
our aggregate level of indebtedness increased in connection with the sale of our debentures 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness and had the ability to incur additional debt under our revolving credit facility 
we may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 
any increase in our leverage could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  limiting our ability to make acquisitions  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industries in which we compete  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources 
our ability to satisfy our future obligations  including debt service on our debentures  depends on our future operating performance and on economic  financial  competitive  and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy 
if we are unable to service our debt and fund our business  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  seek additional financing or equity capital  restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk  sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  and commodity price or equity price risk 
we have not purchased options or entered into swaps or forward or futures contracts 
interest rate risk we invest primarily in us government obligations as well as tax exempt municipal bonds and corporate bonds 
as a result  our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk to our investments  which would affect the carrying value of those investments 
during  the united states federal reserve board began increasing benchmark interest rates and at the february meeting of the federal open market committee increased rates for the sixth time  a total of basis points  since june  a significant increase in interest rates would increase the rate of return on our cash and cash equivalents  but would have a negative impact on the carrying value of our marketable securities 
our annual interest income would change by approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december  for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  would change by approximately million for each basis point increase or decrease in rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  would decrease by approximately million for each basis point increase in rates and would increase by approximately million for each basis point decrease in rates 
changes in market rates and the related impact on the fair value of our investments would not generally affect net income as our investments are fixed rate securities and are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
however  when the investments are sold  the unrealized losses are recorded as realized losses and included in net income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
during  we had a net unrealized loss of approximately million 
during  we had a net unrealized gain of approximately million 
foreign currency risk we transact business in the uk  canada  and india and as such have exposure associated with movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net income by approximately million 
relative to the foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement would have resulted in an additional million reduction of net income for the year ended december  net revenues derived from our foreign operations totaled approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  and totaled approximately of our total revenues for both of the years ended december  and
