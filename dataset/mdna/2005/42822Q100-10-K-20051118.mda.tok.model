item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if an impairment charge is required in the future  the charge would negatively impact reported earnings in the period of the charge 
our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in government regulations or if government regulations decrease the need for our services or increase our costs 
the areas in which we provide outsourcing and consulting services are the subject of government regulation which is constantly evolving 
changes in government regulations in the united states  our principal geographic market  affecting the value  use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs  including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare such as medical plans  defined contribution such as k plans  defined benefit such as pension plans or payroll delivery  may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our services 
in addition  our growth strategy includes a number of global expansion objectives which further subject us to applicable laws and regulations of countries outside the united states 
if we are unable to adapt our services to applicable laws and regulations  our ability to grow our business or to provide effective outsourcing and consulting services in these 
table of contents areas will be negatively impacted 
recently  we have seen regulatory initiatives in both the united states and certain european countries result in companies either discontinuing their defined benefit programs or de emphasizing the importance such programs play in the overall mix of their benefit programs with a trend toward increased use of defined contribution plans 
if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate  our results of operation of our business could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls over financial reporting  our business could suffer 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  both our reputation in the marketplace and our financial results could suffer 
we have spent considerable resources since our initial public offering in june reviewing and implementing improvements to our internal controls 
although we have received an unqualified audit opinion on our internal controls over financial reporting  we cannot be certain that our efforts will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
inadequate internal controls could also cause our clients or our investors to lose confidence in our services delivery or reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to keep pace with rapid changes in technology or if growth in the use of technology in business is not as rapid as in the past 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology  industry standards and client preferences 
we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost effective basis  and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace 
additionally  the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses 
if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more cost effective technologies  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements 
our business is also dependent  in part  upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their employees and our ability to deliver the efficiencies and convenience afforded by technology 
if growth in the use of technology does not continue  demand for our services may decrease 
use of new technology for commerce generally requires understanding and acceptance of a new way of conducting business and exchanging information 
companies that have already invested substantial resources in traditional means of conducting commerce and exchanging information may be particularly reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that would not utilize their existing personnel and infrastructure 
if our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services  we may face damage to our professional reputation or legal liability 
we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high quality outsourcing and consulting services 
as a result  if a client is not satisfied with our services  it may be more damaging in our business than in other businesses 
moreover  if we fail to meet our contractual obligations  we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships 
the nature of our work  especially our actuarial services  involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events  the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance 
in addition  we could make computational  software programming or data management errors 
further  a client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice 
defending lawsuits arising out of any of our services could require substantial amounts of management attention  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
our exposure to liability on a particular engagement may be greater than the profit opportunity of the engagement 
in addition to client liability  governmental authorities may impose penalties in respect of our errors or omissions and may preclude us from doing business in relevant jurisdictions 
in addition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums  claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business 

table of contents in addition  one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and plan participants 
we have established several policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information 
although we continue to review and improve our policies and procedures  we cannot be certain that such policies and procedures will be sufficient to prevent improper access to or disclosure of this information in the future 
further  data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations  which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services 
our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace 
we depend on our employees  the inability to attract new talent or the loss of key employees could damage or result in the loss of client relationships and adversely affect our business 
our success and ability to grow are dependent  in part  on our ability to hire and retain large numbers of talented people 
in particular  our employees personal relationships with our clients are an important element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements 
the inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet demand or losing employees who manage substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete engagements  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
in connection with our initial public offering and our transition to a corporate structure  we granted employees shares of restricted stock or stock options to attract  retain and motivate such employees 
since our initial public offering  we have also made  and anticipate making in the future  other equity based awards to many of our employees 
the incentives provided by these awards may not be effective in causing these employees to stay with our organization 
the holders of class b and class c common stock will not be entitled to the full market value of those shares until june the class b and class c common stock holders were subject to restrictions limiting the transferability of their shares of class b and class c common stock that had already vested at full market value 
such transfer restrictions lapsed in june in addition  in connection with our acquisition of exult in october  certain employees of exult deemed important to the success of the combined company received shares of restricted class a common stock  which restrictions lapse in june as these shares reach their full market value and become freely transferable  we may not be successful at retaining the persons holding these shares  many of whom are important to our success 
our global operations and expansion strategy pose complex management  foreign currency  legal  tax and economic risks  which we may not adequately address 
as of september   we had a total of offices in countries and additional offices in additional countries through joint ventures and minority investments 
in fiscal  approximately of our total revenues were attributable to activities in the united states and approximately of our revenues were attributable to our activities in europe  canada  the asia pacific region and latin america 
the continued penetration of markets beyond the united states is expected to be an important component of the combined company s growth strategy 
a number of risks may inhibit our international operations and global sourcing efforts  preventing us from realizing our global expansion objectives  including insufficient demand for our services in foreign jurisdictions  which may be due to applicable laws and regulations or benefit practices in such jurisdictions  ability to execute effective and efficient cross border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws  restrictions on the movement of cash  political instability and international terrorism  currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  restrictions on the import and export of technologies  
table of contents price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies  and trade barriers 
the demand for benefits outsourcing services and or human resources business process outsourcing services may not grow at rates we anticipate 
we are making a significant investment and devoting significant attention to our human resources business process outsourcing services offering 
our strategy for growth is in part based on our expectation that this market will experience significant growth 
our human resources business process outsourcing services offering may not be well received by our clients  or the demand for human resources business process outsourcing may not grow as rapidly as we anticipate  which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profit margins 
in addition  the growth for stand alone benefits outsourcing services has slowed  particularly in the large plan market over  participants  as some larger companies that have not previously outsourced some of their benefit programs consider whether they wish to outsource a larger portion of their human resources function or continue to administer such programs themselves 
if a greater percentage of such organizations determine not to outsource such programs than we anticipate  it could also have an adverse impact on our revenues and profit margins 
if we fail to establish and maintain alliances for developing  marketing and delivering our services  our ability to increase our revenues and profitability may suffer 
our growth depends  in part  on our ability to develop and maintain alliances with businesses such as brokerage firms  financial services companies  health care organizations  insurance companies  other business process outsourcing organizations and other companies in order to develop  market and deliver our services 
if our strategic alliances are discontinued or we have difficulty developing new alliances  our ability to increase or maintain our client base may be substantially diminished 
we rely on third parties to provide services and their failure to perform the service could do harm to our business 
as part of providing services to clients  we rely on a number of third party service providers 
these providers include  but are not limited to  plan trustees and payroll service providers responsible for transferring funds to employees or on behalf of employees  and providers of data and information  such as software vendors  health plan providers  investment managers and investment advisers  that we work with to provide information to clients employees 
it also includes providers of human resource functions such as recruiters and trainers employed by us in connection with our human resources business processing services delivered to our clients 
failure of third party service providers to perform in a timely manner could result in contractual or regulatory penalties  liability claims from clients and or employees  damage to our reputation and harm to our business 
we have only a limited ability to protect the intellectual property rights that are important to our success  and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property 
existing laws of some countries in which we provide or intend to provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  confidentiality policies  non disclosure and other contractual arrangements and copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights 
the steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property  and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
protecting our intellectual property rights may also consume significant management time and resources 
we cannot be sure that our services and products  or the products of others that we offer to our clients  do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties  and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients 
these claims may harm our reputation  result in financial liabilities and prevent us from 
table of contents offering some services or products 
we have generally agreed in our outsourcing contracts to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties 
in some instances  the amount of these indemnities may be greater than the revenues we receive from the client 
any claims or litigation in this area  whether we ultimately win or lose  could be time consuming and costly  injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
we may not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms 
any limitation on our ability to provide a service or product could cause us to lose revenue generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 
we rely on our computing and communications infrastructure and the integrity of these systems  and our revenue growth depends  in part  on our ability to use the internet as a means of delivering human resources services 
the internet is a key mechanism for delivering our services to our clients efficiently and cost effectively 
our clients may not be receptive to human resource services delivered over the internet due to concerns regarding transaction security  user privacy  the reliability and quality of internet service and other reasons 
our clients concerns may be heightened by the fact we use the internet to transmit extremely confidential information about our clients and their employees  such as compensation  medical information and other personally identifiable information 
in addition  the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and volume of traffic 
as a result  its performance and reliability may decline 
in order to maintain the level of security  service and reliability that our clients require  we may be required to make significant investments in our on line means of delivering human resources services 
in addition  websites and proprietary on line services have experienced service interruptions and other delays occurring throughout their infrastructure 
if these outages or delays occur frequently in the future  internet usage as a medium of exchange of information could grow more slowly or decline and the internet might not adequately support our web based tools 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations with respect to the internet may impede the efficiency of the internet as a medium of exchange of information and decrease the demand for our services 
if we cannot use the internet effectively to deliver our services  our revenue growth and results of operation may be impaired 
we may lose client data as a result of major catastrophes and other similar problems which may materially adversely impact our operations 
we have multiple processing centers around the globe which use various commercial methods for disaster recovery capabilities 
our main data processing center  located in lincolnshire  illinois is in a dual separate data center configuration to provide back up capabilities 
in the event of a disaster  we have developed business continuity plans  however  they may not be sufficient  and the data recovered may not be sufficient for the administration of our clients human resources programs and processes 
our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability will vary from quarter to quarter  which may result in volatility of our stock price 
our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
this may lead to volatility in our stock price 
the factors that are likely to cause these variations are the rate at which we obtain new outsourcing engagements since our outsourcing engagements often require substantial implementation costs that are recovered over the term of the engagements  seasonality of certain services  including annual benefit enrollment processes  timing of consulting projects and their termination  the introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  pricing pressure on new client services and renewals  the timing  success and costs of sales  marketing and product development programs  the success of strategic acquisitions  alliances or investments  changes in estimates  accruals and payments of variable compensation to our employees  and general economic factors 
in addition  our operating results in future periods may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which may materially adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 

table of contents our initial stockholders  many of whom are employees  continue to hold a high percentage of our outstanding stock and their interests may differ from those of our other stockholders 
as of september   our initial stockholders and their assignees owned shares of class b and class c common stock representing approximately of the voting interest in hewitt 
pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  the class b and class c common stock are voted together in accordance with a majority of the votes cast by the holders of such stock  voting together as a group 
as long as our initial stockholders continue to own or control a significant block of shares  our initial stockholders have a significant influence over the voting process 
this will enable our initial stockholders  to have a significant influence over the election of the board of directors  control of management policies and determination of the outcome of most corporate transactions or other matters submitted to all the stockholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets 
in addition  most of our initial stockholders are our employees and they may act in their own interest as employees  which may conflict with or not be the same as the interests of stockholders who are not employees 
our stock price may decline due to the large number of shares of common stock eligible for future sale 
sales of substantial amounts of our class a  class b or class c common stock  or the potential for sales  may adversely affect the price of our class a common stock and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities in the future 
as of september   we had  shares of class a common stock outstanding   shares of class b common stock outstanding and  shares of class c common stock outstanding 
in addition  there were  shares underlying options   unvested restricted stock units outstanding under our global stock plan   shares from an exult legacy stock plan  and  additional shares reserved for issuance under our global stock plan as of such date 
our initial stockholders and their respective assignees own all of the shares of our class b and class c common stock 
shares of class b and class c common stock automatically convert into shares of class a common stock on a one for one basis when they are sold by our initial stockholders or their related party assignees 
a portion of these shares goodwill shares are subject to a phase in from book value to market value through june in addition  all class b and class c shares were subject to certain transfer restrictions that expired in june initial stockholders who remain active in the business continue to be subject to certain hold requirements on of the original number of goodwill shares issued to them at the time of the initial public offering 
there are significant limitations on the ability of any person or company to buy hewitt without the approval of the board of directors  which may decrease the price of our class a common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of hewitt more difficult without the approval of our board of directors  including the following our board of directors is classified into three classes  each of which serves for a staggered three year term  all shares of class b and class c common stock are voted together in accordance with a majority of the votes cast by the holders of class b and class c common stock  voting together as a group  a director may be removed by our stockholders only for cause and then only by the affirmative vote of two thirds of the outstanding voting power of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors  only the board of directors or the chairman of the board may call special meetings of our stockholders  our stockholders may take action only at a meeting of the stockholders and not by written consent  our stockholders must comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to place stockholders proposals on the agenda for consideration at meetings of the stockholders  the board of directors may consider the impact of any proposed change of control transaction on constituencies other than the stockholders in determining what is in the best interest of hewitt  business combinations involving one or more persons that own or intend to own at least of the voting stock must be approved by the affirmative vote of holders of at least of the voting stock  unless the 
table of contents consideration paid in the business combination is generally the highest price paid by these persons to acquire the voting stock or a majority of the directors unaffiliated with these persons who were directors prior to the time these persons acquired their shares approve the transaction  and the stockholders may amend or repeal the provisions of the certificate of incorporation and the by laws regarding change of control transactions and business combinations only by a vote of holders of two thirds of the outstanding common stock at that time 
section of the delaware general corporation law may delay  defer or prevent a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interest 
we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits certain business combinations between a delaware corporation and an interested stockholder generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of or more of a delaware corporation s voting stock for a three year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder 
section could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control that the stockholders might consider to be in their best interest 
item properties our principal executive offices are located in lincolnshire  illinois with a mailing address of half day road  lincolnshire  illinois our lincolnshire complex comprises buildings on two campuses and approximately million square feet 
as of september   we had a total of offices in countries and additional offices in additional countries through joint ventures and minority investments 
we do not own any significant real property  but lease office space under long term leases 
we believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional space will be available as needed 
item legal proceedings we are not engaged in any legal proceeding that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

on june   we acquired the benefits consulting business of bacon woodrow ltd 
and its results are included in our results from that date 
includes the results of sageo  a business we launched with the intention of creating a stand alone  internet based company that would provide a standardized set of health and welfare offerings to companies seeking less complex benefits solutions 
in the quarter ended september   the decision was made to transition sageo clients from sageo s website to our total benefit administration web interface 
stand alone company expenses were eliminated and sageo website development spending ceased 
at that time  since we had decided to discontinue the use of the sageo website  we wrote off our remaining investment in the sageo software resulting in a million non recurring charge  and terminated or redeployed the sageo employees who worked within the stand alone sageo operation 
prior to our transition to a corporate structure  we operated as a limited liability company through may  in such form  our owners were compensated through distributions of income and we did not incur firm level income tax 
accordingly  results prior to may  do not include i compensation for services rendered by the owners or ii firm level income tax expense 
as a result  income before taxes and owner distributions is not comparable to net income of a corporation 
in connection with our transition to a corporate structure  on june   the owners who worked in the business became employees and we began to record their compensation and related expenses and became subject to corporate income taxes 
loss per share in fiscal is calculated based on earnings during the four month period from may   the date on which our transition to a corporate structure was completed  through september  the loss was generated primarily from several one time charges incurred in connection with the transition to a corporate structure totaling million and compensation expense related to the initial public offering restricted stock awards totaling million through september  similarly  common stock is weighted from may  and not from the beginning of the periods presented

overview our strategic objectives of serving clients exceptionally well  having engaged and focused employees and creating a strong and growing business remained central to our focus in fiscal the following events illustrate actions taken towards successfully achieving these goals 
exult merger on october  we completed the merger with exult  inc exult  a leading provider of human resources business process outsourcing 
exult s results of operations are included in our historical results from this date 
with our integration of exult this past year  we have expanded our market leadership in human resources business process outsourcing and the scope and flexibility of our human resources business process outsourcing hr bpo capabilities so that we now have the flexibility either to take over a company s existing human resources operations and technologies or to migrate a company to our proprietary technologies  depending on which approach best meets our clients needs and business objectives 
some post merger financial effects that we expect to see in future results include changes in business mix relating to the expansion of the hr bpo business 
when we bring on new hr bpo clients  we typically assume their existing cost structure  including personnel and third party subcontractors  and work to transform the processes  systems and service delivery to reduce costs over time 
as the hr bpo business grows within our outsourcing segment  we expect near term negative impacts on our firmwide and outsourcing segment margins as we make investments in our hr bpo business infrastructure and upfront investments to implement new contracts and transform the underlying client processes 
margins are expected to improve as the initial hr bpo contracts mature and the average age of our hr bpo client contract portfolio increases 
internal reorganization as we head into fiscal  we are completing an internal reorganization that will improve our ability to deliver integrated total human resources solutions to clients 
first and foremost  our realignment focuses on integration across operational areas  service areas and business regions 
we expect this reorganization will foster better client and business connections  and allow us to share knowledge and leverage resources in the most effective way possible to build our overall business and deliver exceptional results for our clients 

table of contents in our outsourcing segment  after the exult merger  we integrated the operations of benefits outsourcing and hr bpo 
we view the services delivered by these groups to be largely leveraged by shared operations and proprietary processes and methodologies 
in the future  we anticipate that we will integrate further as a business group and focus on three critical client service areas core process management  talent management and workforce management to ensure we re maintaining and evolving our depth of knowledge and delivery expertise across all of these areas 
in addition  we believe this will help reinforce the links that already exist between our outsourcing delivery and consulting capabilities to create and provide more holistic client solutions 
in our consulting segment  we brought together our separate consulting lines of business into a single  global consulting business group  under common global leadership 
we have also combined our retirement and financial management and health management service areas into a benefits consulting service to create opportunities for more innovation and change  finding efficiencies  building a more connected and integrated offer to the marketplace  as well as expanding career opportunities for our associates 
we have also realigned our client development sales organization 
we have embedded sales and accounts teams into both the consulting and outsourcing segments to have sales associates closer to the business and the services we offer across multiple geographies 
the realignment of the sales group within the segments was completed by the end of the fiscal year 
benefits outsourcing market changes throughout  we noticed a shift in demand for our benefits outsourcing services 
our new clients are increasingly looking to bundle these services into broader outsourcing relationships as evidenced by the fact that each of the hr bpo contracts signed in fiscal included at least one benefits service 
we anticipate this trend will drive further integration of our service offerings to address our client needs 
in addition  the trend provides significant growth potential for our hr outsourcing services to extend beyond our core benefits outsourcing expertise 
while we expect the benefits outsourcing service to continue to grow  we expect the shift in demand to broader hr bpo services will decrease the percentage of the total outsourcing business that stand alone benefits outsourcing services represents

consolidated results fiscal year ended september  as a result of the merger with exult on october   the results of operations for the years ended september  and are not comparable 
in order to provide a more meaningful discussion of our results  the following table presents the audited historical results of hewitt for the year ended september   and the unaudited pro forma results for the year ended september   as if the merger and consolidation had occurred on october  the unaudited pro forma combined income statement is presented for comparison purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that might have occurred had the merger actually taken place as of the dates specified  or that may be expected to occur in the future 
additionally  the unaudited combined pro forma income statement does not assume any benefits from cost savings or synergies and does not reflect any integration costs that the combined company realized or incurred after the merger 
the discussion that follows is based upon comparing fiscal results with pro forma results 
for a more detailed discussion of our pro forma results of operations  including reclassifications and adjustments  please refer to the pro forma results reconciliation later in this section 

table of contents year ended september  change of net revenues in thousands pro forma revenues revenues before reimbursements net revenues reimbursements total revenues operating expenses compensation and related expenses  excluding initial public offering restricted stock awards initial public offering restricted stock awards reimbursable expenses other operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses total operating expenses operating income other expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income overview in addition to our merger with exult in  there are two other acquisitions that have an effect on comparability between our fiscal and results 
in may  exult acquired reloaction  a relocation services company and in february  we acquired the majority interest in our puerto rico operations  collectively  the prior year acquisitions 
the results of the acquisitions are included in our results from their respective acquisition dates and as such are reflected in our fiscal results and a portion of our results 
as previously reported  two acquired hr bpo contracts were terminated earlier in the year which resulted in impairment charges of approximately million in the second quarter 
one of these contracts accounted for approximately million of revenue in fiscal year this contract was substantially completed by the end of the fiscal year with minimal revenue and related direct expenses continuing into the first quarter of fiscal year a significant portion of the annual revenues on this contract approximately million consisted of third party supplier revenues which were nominally profitable 
net revenues net revenues increased  to  million for the year ended september   from  million in the pro forma prior year 
adjusting for the net favorable effects of foreign currency translation of approximately million and the favorable effects of the prior year acquisitions of approximately million  net revenues grew over the pro forma prior year period 

table of contents the revenue growth was primarily related to increased services to new and existing clients in our hr bpo business  an increase of million in hr bpo related third party supplier revenues  and  to a lesser extent  increases in revenue from our benefits outsourcing business as well as growth in our consulting segment 
retirement and financial management grew in all regions  particularly in europe and north america  and talent and organization consulting services grew year over year  primarily outside of north america 
compensation and related expenses compensation and related expenses which include personnel  supplemental staffing and related expenses increased  to  million for the year ended september   from  million in the pro forma prior year 
as a percentage of net revenues  compensation and related expenses decreased to from in the pro forma prior year 
the million increase in compensation and related expenses was due to increases in wages  primarily outsourcing personnel to support outsourcing segment growth  severance related expenses of million due primarily to the internal realignment  the effects of foreign currency translation of million  the exult retention related awards of million  and compensation expenses related to the prior year acquisitions of approximately million 
this increase was offset in part by reductions of performance based compensation of million and lower discretionary benefit plan expense of million versus the pro forma prior year 
lower compensation and related expenses as a percentage of net revenues also reflects a higher proportion of net revenues managed by hewitt and provided by third party suppliers  where the costs of third party suppliers are reported in other operating expenses 
initial public offering restricted stock awards in connection with our initial public offering on june   we granted approximately million shares of class a restricted stock and restricted stock units to our employees

table of contents net revenues net revenues increased to  million for the year ended september   from  million in prior year 
adjusting for the effects of acquisitions of approximately million and foreign currency translation of approximately million  net revenues grew in net revenue growth was primarily due to increases in new core services in benefits outsourcing  an increase in one time projects in outsourcing and the addition of new hr bpo formerly  workforce management clients 
compensation and related expenses compensation and related expenses increased  to  million for the year ended september   from  million in the prior year 
the million increase in compensation and related expenses in was due to increases in employee headcount from and acquisitions  the effects of foreign currency translation  wage increases  and increases in outsourcing personnel to support the growth of benefits administration outsourcing and hr bpo formerly  workforce management businesses 
excluding compensation expenses related to acquisitions of approximately million and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of approximately million  compensation and related expenses grew in as a percentage of net revenues  compensation and related expenses increased slightly in primarily due to lower than expected revenues relative to compensation increases in our retirement plan consulting business in europe  offset by our continued effort to increase productivity and leverage technology within our benefits administration outsourcing business  increased productivity in certain of our discretionary consulting services and the leveraging of shared services personnel 
initial public offering restricted stock awards in connection with our initial public offering on june   we granted approximately million shares of class a restricted stock and restricted stock units to our employees 
compensation and related payroll tax expenses of approximately million were recorded as initial public offering restricted stock award expense from june  through september   of which million was recorded in and million in the decrease in the initial public offering restricted stock award expense in is a direct result of the timing of the vesting of the awards 
stock awards that vested over six months were fully expensed in early  while the awards vesting over four years continue to be recognized into expense through june  other operating expenses other operating expenses increased  to million for the year ended september   from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  other operating expenses declined slightly to in from in the million increase in primarily reflects the inclusion of operating costs from our acquisitions  increased occupancy expenses in connection with a planned office relocation in the united kingdom and increases in computer equipment repairs and maintenance  partially offset by lower depreciation on computer equipment

table of contents provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in and million in the increase in the provision reflects the increase in pre tax earnings in the effective tax rate was in and segment results fiscal year ended september  exult s operating results are included within the outsourcing segment 
the pro forma fiscal results reflect an allocation of exult cost center expenses which is consistent with the allocation methodology applied to our similar shared service costs 
the costs of information services  human resources and the direct client delivery activities provided by hewitt s client development function were allocated to the outsourcing and consulting segments on a specific identification basis or based on usage and combined pro forma headcount 
the addition of exult personnel in outsourcing resulted in a shift in allocated costs from the consulting segment to the outsourcing segment which is consistent with the allocation methodologies used by hewitt for all periods presented

the revenue growth was due  in part  to the addition of revenues from the acquisitions as well as the effects of foreign currency translation 
excluding the favorable effects of the acquisitions of approximately million and the net favorable effects of foreign currency translation of approximately million  outsourcing net revenues increased 
this increase was primarily due to increased services to new and existing clients in our hr bpo business  which included an increase in subcontracted third party supplier revenues of million  and  to a lesser extent  increases in revenue from our stand alone benefits outsourcing business 
growth in the stand alone benefits business primarily related to a change in service mix toward higher revenue generating administrative services  and was partially offset by the planned re pricing of some older contracts to current market prices 

table of contents outsourcing segment income decreased  to million in the year ended september   from million in the pro forma prior year 
outsourcing segment income as a percentage of outsourcing net revenues decreased to in  from in the pro forma prior year period 
included in the current year results were a million customer relationship intangible assets impairment charge related to two outsourcing contracts which were terminated in the second quarter  exult retention related awards expense of million offset in part by the addition of the acquisitions which contributed million of operating income in segment income also benefited from lower performance based compensation and discretionary benefit plan expenses for outsourcing personnel of million and million  respectively  than in the pro forma prior year period 
after excluding the effect of these items  outsourcing margins decreased due to higher losses on early stage hr bpo contracts  a higher mix of third party supplier revenues  a higher than anticipated level of expense including the build out of our global delivery capabilities  and lower benefits outsourcing margins 
benefits margins were down modestly primarily due to re pricing of some older contracts to market prices and to a lesser extent by higher client service delivery costs in the year 
consulting consulting net revenues increased by  to million in the year ended september   from million in the pro forma prior year 
a portion of this growth was due to the net favorable effect of foreign currency translation of approximately million and the favorable effect of the acquisitions of a majority interest in our puerto rico operations and a pension management business in the netherlands of approximately million 
adjusting for the effects of foreign currency and the acquisitions  consulting net revenues increased by in  as compared to the pro forma prior year 
for the year ended september   the increase was primarily due to growth in retirement and financial management  primarily in europe and north america  and talent and organization consulting services primarily outside north america 
consulting segment income increased by  to million in the year ended september   from million in the pro forma prior year 
consulting segment margin increased to from 
the increase in margins was primarily due to lower performance based compensation and lower discretionary benefit plan expenses for consulting personnel of million and million  respectively  than in the pro forma prior year period 
after excluding the effect of these items  margin increased in over the pro forma prior year primarily in retirement and financial management and talent and organization consulting services due largely to higher revenues in these practices  while leveraging the cost base

during and  we completed a number of acquisitions whose results are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates 
please also see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these acquisitions 
where the acquisitions had an effect on comparability  we have noted them in the analysis that follows 
outsourcing outsourcing net revenues increased by  to  million for the year ended september   from  million in the prior year 
revenue growth in was due  in part  to the addition of and acquisitions totaling approximately million  as well as favorable effects of foreign currency translation of approximately million 
excluding the effects of these acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation  outsourcing net revenues increased in this outsourcing net revenue growth was primarily in the benefits administration business and was due to the addition of new core benefits services  an increase in one time projects and new hr bpo known then as workforce management clients coming on line

table of contents consulting consulting net revenues increased  to million for the year ended september   from million in the prior year 
the majority of this growth was due to the effect of favorable foreign currency translation of approximately million and the addition of and acquisitions of approximately million 
adjusting for the favorable effects of foreign currency and the acquisitions  consulting net revenues decreased in declines in demand for certain of our discretionary consulting services were mostly offset by growth in health benefit management consulting while retirement and financial management was generally flat year over year 
consulting segment income decreased by  to million in the year ended september   from million in the prior year 
consulting segment income as a percentage of consulting net revenues was in and in adjusting for effects of acquisitions in and  segment income as a percentage of consulting net revenues was in and in the decrease in margins in was primarily the result of declines in our european region  driven by a combination of higher costs due to a previously planned office relocation as well as compensation costs on lower than planned revenue due in part to a delay in the timing of anticipated work related to benefit related legislative changes in europe  as well a decline in revenue for certain discretionary communications and other consulting assignments in north america 
critical accounting policies and estimates conforming with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and this annual report on form k 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  known facts  current and expected economic conditions and  in some cases  actuarial techniques 
we periodically reevaluate these significant factors and make adjustments when facts and circumstances change  however  actual results may differ from estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and client contract loss reserves  deferred contract costs and revenues  performance based compensation  accounts receivable and unbilled work in process  goodwill and other intangible assets  retirement plans and income taxes 
revenue recognition revenues include fees generated from outsourcing contracts and from consulting services provided to our clients 
outsourcing contract terms typically range from three to five years for benefits contracts and seven to ten years for hr bpo contracts  while consulting arrangements are generally of a short term nature 
in connection with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we have contracts with multiple elements primarily in our outsourcing segment 
multiple element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
eitf issue establishes the following criteria  all of which must be met  in order for a deliverable to qualify  as a separate unit of accounting the delivered items have value to the client on a stand alone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if these criteria are not met  deliverables included in an arrangement are accounted for as a single unit of accounting and revenue is deferred until the period in which the final deliverable is provided or a predominant service level has been attained 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
revenue is then recognized using a proportional performance method such as recognizing revenue based on transactional services delivered or on a straight line basis as adjusted primarily for volume changes  as appropriate 

table of contents our clients typically pay for consulting services either on a time and material or on a fixed fee basis 
on fixed fee engagements  revenues are recognized either as services are provided using a proportional performance method  which utilizes estimates of overall profitability and stages of project completion  or at the completion of the project  based on the facts and circumstances of the client arrangement 
losses on outsourcing or consulting arrangements are recognized during the period in which a loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contract or project losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and a portion of indirect costs exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the arrangement 
estimates are monitored during the term of the arrangement and any changes to estimates are recorded in the current period and can result in either increases or decreases to income 
deferred contract costs and deferred contract revenues for long term outsourcing service agreements  implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on the company s systems and operating processes 
for outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting  specific  incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services going live are deferred and amortized over the period the related ongoing services revenue is recognized 
such costs may include internal and external costs for coding or creating customizations of systems  costs for conversion of client data and costs to negotiate contract terms 
for outsourcing services that are accounted for as a combined unit of accounting  specific  incremental and direct costs of implementation  as well as ongoing service delivery costs incurred prior to revenue recognition commencing are deferred and amortized over the remaining contract services period 
implementation fees are also generally received from our clients either up front or over the ongoing services period in the fee per participant 
lump sum implementation fees received from a client are initially deferred and then recognized as revenue evenly over the contract ongoing services period 
if a client terminates an outsourcing services arrangement prior to the end of the contract  a loss on the contract may be recorded if necessary and any remaining deferred implementation revenues and costs would then be recognized into earnings through the termination date 
performance based compensation our compensation program includes a performance based component that is determined by management and the compensation and leadership committee of our board of directors 
performance based compensation is discretionary and is based on individual  team  and total company performance 
the amount of expense for performance based compensation recognized at interim and annual reporting dates involves judgment  is based on our quarterly and annual results as compared to our internal targets  and takes into account other factors  including industry trends and the general economic environment 
annual performance based compensation levels may vary from current expectations as a result of changes in the actual performance of the company  team or individual 
as such  accrued amounts are subject to change in future periods if actual future performance varies from performance levels anticipated in prior interim periods 
client receivables and unbilled work in process we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our client receivables and unbilled work in process based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific client s difficulty in meeting its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy  failure to pay amounts due to us or to others  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the client receivable to what we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other clients  we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past write off history and the length of time the receivables are past due 
facts and circumstances may change  which would require us to alter our estimates of the collectibility of client receivables and unbilled work in process 
a key factor mitigating this risk is our diverse client base 
for the years ended september   and  no single client accounted for more than of our total revenues 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets in applying the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired have been based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisitions  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
estimates of fair value have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired businesses and net assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities for that reporting unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the reporting unit 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our experience  knowledge and typically third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by other factors and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise 
the evaluation of impairment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is considered impaired 
the impairment expense is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period 
retirement plans we provide pension benefits to certain of our employees outside of north america and other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees in north america 
the valuation of the funded status and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using actuarial assumptions  which are reviewed annually 
the assumptions include rates of increases in employee compensation  interest rates used to discount liabilities  the long term rate of return on plan assets  anticipated future health care costs  and other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
the selection of assumptions is based on both short term and long term historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation 
the use of different assumptions would have resulted in different measures of the funded status and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit expenses 
actual results in the future could differ from expected results 
we are not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results  but believe our assumptions are appropriate 
our assumptions are listed in note the most critical assumptions pertain to the plans covering employees outside north america  as these plans are the most significant to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance will not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provisions and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
pro forma results reconciliation the following unaudited pro forma combined income statement with explanatory notes present combined unaudited statements of operations of hewitt and exult for the year ended september   giving effect to the merger as if 
table of contents it had been completed on october   the beginning of hewitt s fiscal year 
the unaudited pro forma combined income statement has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes of both hewitt and exult 
the unaudited pro forma combined financial information shows the impact of the merger with exult on hewitt s historical results of operations applying the purchase method of accounting 
under this method of accounting  the results of operations of hewitt and exult were combined from the merger date forward 
the unaudited pro forma combined income statement is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that might have occurred had the merger actually taken place as of the date specified  or that may be expected to occur in the future 
it does not assume any benefits from cost savings or synergies and it does not reflect any integration costs that the combined company realized or incurred after the merger 
the unaudited pro forma combined income statement reflects the estimated effect of exult s adoption of hewitt s accounting policy of recognizing revenue described in critical accounting policies and estimates above 
exult s policy was to recognize revenue for long term  multi deliverable process management contracts based on the proportion of contract costs incurred to date to the then current estimates of total contract costs 
the effect of changes to total estimated contract revenues or costs was recognized in the period in which the determination was made that facts and circumstances dictated a change of estimate

pro forma adjustments the pro forma adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined income statement are as follows a this adjustment reflects the estimated effect of exult s adoption of hewitt s accounting policy of recognizing revenue as described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
exult s policy was to recognize revenue for long term multi deliverable process management contracts for each reporting period based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the then current estimates of total contract costs 
the effect of changes to total estimated contract revenues or costs was recognized in the period in which the determination was made that facts and circumstances dictated a change of estimate 
the effect of this adjustment is to decrease net revenues by  for the year ended september  for the year ended september   this entry also includes the effect of removing the million bank of america termination adjustment that exult recorded in their quarter ended march  b these adjustments reflect the elimination of hewitt services sold to exult 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated from the unaudited pro forma combined income statement 
c these adjustments reflect the reversal of exult s historical amortization of intangible assets and record the amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill resulting from the merger 
the impact of these adjustments is to decrease amortization expense as follows year ended september  historical amortization expense pro forma amortization expense decrease in amortization expense the reversal of amortization of certain intangible assets which were recorded by exult as a reduction of revenue over the applicable contract term resulted in a net increase to net revenues of  for the year ended september  d these adjustments reflect the elimination of the expense incurred for the incentive bonuses of  for the portion of the bonus period ending september  and the elimination of professional fees incurred by exult related to the merger 
e this adjustment eliminates the amortization of unearned compensation on exult s heritage restricted stock awards 
in connection with the merger  the majority of exult s heritage restricted stock was converted into hewitt class a common stock  keeping the original restrictions and vesting periods 
as a result  the adjustment also records the amortization of the unearned compensation of the converted restricted stock 
f these adjustments reflect the write off of exult s historical depreciation of property and equipment and record the depreciation of property and equipment acquired in the merger based on their estimated fair values and useful lives 
the impact of these adjustments is to decrease depreciation expense as follows year ended september  historical depreciation expense pro forma depreciation expense decrease in depreciation expense g this adjustment reduces interest income as a result of the cash payments of  pertaining to the settlement of exult s employee stock options for  and incentive bonuses of  for the portion of the 
table of contents bonus period ending september  had the cash payment occurred as of october  for the unaudited pro forma income statement  interest income on cash and cash equivalents would have been lower by for the year ended september  h these adjustments record the interest expense on long term debt instruments and capital lease obligations based upon the fair value of those instruments and obligations at the date of merger 
the impact of the adjustments was to increase interest expense by for the year ended september  i this adjustment reflects the anticipated income tax expense  which was redetermined based on the combined income of exult and hewitt 
the adjusted effective tax rate is for the pro forma year ended september  actual effective tax rates may differ from the pro forma rates reflected in this unaudited pro forma combined income statement and will ultimately depend on several variables  including the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations including the amount of any foreign losses for which a valuation allowance is recorded  and the overall level of earnings 
j for the year ended september   the weighted average shares were calculated using the historical weighted average shares outstanding of hewitt and the actual number of hewitt shares issued for the merger at october  earnings per share data have been computed based on the combined historical net income of hewitt  loss from continuing operations for exult and the impact of pro forma adjustments 

table of contents quarterly results the following tables set forth the historical unaudited quarterly financial data for the periods indicated 
the information for each of these periods has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and  in our opinion  reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial results

seasonality and inflation revenues and income vary over the fiscal year 
within our outsourcing segment  we generally experience a seasonal increase in our fiscal fourth and first quarter revenues because our clients benefit enrollment processes typically occur during the fall 
within our consulting segment  we typically experience a seasonal peak in the fiscal third and fourth quarters which reflects our clients business needs for these services 
we believe inflation has had little effect on our results of operations during the past three years 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our growth and working capital requirements with internally generated funds  credit facilities and term notes 
our change to a corporate structure in may and our initial public offering in june enhanced our ability to access public market financing to fund new investments and acquisitions  as well as to meet ongoing and future capital resource needs 
summary of cash flows in thousands year ended september  cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was million  million and million at september   and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital in was primarily related to the funding of the company s tender offer in the second quarter of  in which the company repurchased million of the company s class a common stock from shareholders 
this repurchase was funded through the sale of investments  cash on hand and short term borrowings see note to the consolidated financial statements tender offer for additional information 
for the years ended september   and  cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to increased cash collections of receivables and advance billings  higher income from operations before non cash items in the current year  higher upfront implementation fees  a non recurring million refund of prepaid rent stemming from a client termination in the second quarter of fiscal and a million fee for renegotiating certain of our real estate terms 
these increases were partially offset by higher annual performance based compensation paid out in early for the fiscal year than was paid out in for the fiscal year  an increase in expenditures related to deferred contract costs on new client contracts and the payment of higher income taxes for the combined company in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily related to a significant increase in advanced billing arrangements in while the levels remained flat 
additionally  the decrease was due in part to the timing of cash collections of receivables and limited deferred billing arrangements  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and deferred compensation 
we incur significant cash outflows in connection with new outsourcing contracts 
during fiscal year  we capitalized  net of amortization  an additional million of implementation and ongoing service costs  the great majority of these costs in connection with our hr bpo services 
fees for implementations received ahead of delivering our ongoing services are also recorded as deferred contract revenues and amortized over the contract services period 
historically  we received a greater amount of implementation fees at the beginning of our arrangements 
in recent years  and primarily in connection with our hr bpo contracts  more of the client investments are being recovered from fees received over the ongoing services period 
we generally have early termination provisions and other protections to recover these investments and fees for services provided to date 
the fact that we may spend more and recover less for our client service investments in earlier periods of a new contract will reduce our operating cash flows in those periods when we enter into the new outsourcing contracts 
for the years ended september   and cash provided by investing activities was million and cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities in primarily reflects a lower level of short term investment purchases than in the prior year 
this was partially offset by higher expenditures for new computers  equipment including mainframe computer and disk storage upgrades  new servers  personal computers  telecommunications equipment and software enhancements 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of short term investments  less net cash paid for acquisitions and lower software development expenditures in the current year than in the prior year
