any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require management to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  based on historical experience  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions  judgments and estimates and were used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements recognition of cost of forwarding the billing of cost of forwarding is usually delayed 
as a result  we must estimate the cost of purchased transportation and services  and accrue an amount on a load by load basis in a manner that is consistent with revenue recognition 
such estimate is based on past trends  and on the judgment of management 
historically  upon completion of the payment cycle receipt and payment of transportation bills  the actual aggregate transportation costs are not materially different than the accrual 
however  in any case in which the actual cost varies significantly from the accrual  a revision to the accrual would be required 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we must include an expense within the tax provision of the consolidated statement of income in each period in which the allowance is increased 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance  against our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods  then we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
based on our current financial projections  we currently believe that we will realize of our deferred tax assets 
valuing long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable long lived assets purchased intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
factors that we consider when evaluating for possible impairment include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative economic trends 
when determining whether the carrying value of long lived assets and goodwill is impaired based upon the existence of one or more of the above factors  we determine the existence of impairment by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to expected future cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair values 
as of december   goodwill totaled approximately million  other intangible assets amounted to approximately million and our long lived assets  consisting primarily of net property  plant and equipment  totaled as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but rather are to be tested at least annually for impairment 
this pronouncement also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual value and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no

it was also expected that if war began  the space for airfreight shipment would be decreased in order to allow for space reallocations to the us government 
these factors led to an increase in air traffic prior to the beginning of the war in the first quarter 
the tonnage increase caused the demand for shipment space to increase as well  which led to a rise in the cost of space in the first quarter 
rate adjustments to clients were limited to moderate levels  since customers were reluctant to absorb the whole magnitude of the rate increase 
both the number of purchase orders and freight volumes were decreased during the second quarter of as a result of the sars outbreak

another important event during was the labor strike in the west coast ports of the us from october to december of that year

risk factors affecting company operations the company s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities such as airlines  steamship carriers and governmental agencies 
unlike other us logistics companies  the company bears a significant amount of inventory risk 
we pay for the guarantees we put up to the carriers  even if we do not have any customer cargo to fill the space 
we are not able to ask our clients to make these guarantees and  accordingly  we assume all of the risks 
the company has freight forwarders liability insurance that covers it against claims from clients 
we take responsibility for the cargo  and we are responsible for its safe delivery 
therefore  we can be held responsible and incur losses if anything goes wrong 
changes in governmental deregulation efforts  regulations governing the company s products  and or the international trade and tariff environment could all affect the company s business in unpredictable ways 
management believes the company s business has not been significantly or adversely affected by inflation in the past 
historically  the company has generally been successful in passing cost increases to its customers by means of price increases 
however  competitive market place conditions could impede the company s ability to pass on future cost increases to customers and could erode the company s operating margins 
the company continues to assess and improve financial controls  and has negotiated successfully with its banks to get credit facilities for future financial needs 
additional risks and uncertainties include governmental deregulation efforts  regulations governing the company s products and or the international trade and tariff environment adversely affecting our ability to provide services to customers 
competitive marketplace conditions impeding the ability of the company to pass future cost increases to customers 
dependence of the company on international trade resulting from favorable worldwide economic conditions 
dependence of the company on retention and addition of significant customers 
the ability to recruit and retain skilled employees in a tight labor market 
the ability of the company to develop and implement information systems to keep pace with the increasing complexity and growth of the company s business 
following the september  attacks  airlines passed on additional costs such as a fuel  insurance and war risk surcharges 
these surcharges are generally passed through to shippers and consignees  which increases their shipping costs 
as a result of these increased costs  the shipping incentive of customers has been reduced  and the rate of order cancellation has increased 
during march of  the world health organization received reports of severe acute respiratory syndrome in various parts of the world 
sars caused airlines to reduce capacity and adversely affected external trade from hong kong and the pearl river delta 
the company s operations were adversely affected by this health problem 
liquidity and capital resources we used generated approximately   and  of cash from operating activities in  and  respectively 
this increase in the use of cash was mainly attributable to additional amounts used in accounts and other receivables 
it is also due to an increase in deferred tax assets 
net cash used in investing activities was   and  in  and  respectively 
we used  to acquire plant and equipment to improve our office facilities  and used  for the deposits of a potential equity investment

in order to extend our banking facilities  an additional  was pledged to the banks as restricted cash deposits 
notes payable to the banks increase by  during  working capital was  inclusive of restricted cash of million and  as of december  and december  respectively 
we believe that we will be able to rely on cash flow from operations for short term liquidity  and also believe that we have adequate liquidity to satisfy our material commitments for the twelve months following december  we also believe that we can obtain additional liquidity through further negotiation of short term loans from banks to satisfy our short term funding needs  if any 
we intend to continue our expansion plans through a mixture of organic growth and acquisitions 
future acquisitions will focus on companies that serve as freight forwarders in key markets or offer services such as customs brokerage that complement our existing services 
we intend to achieve organic growth through the establishment of new branch offices in latin america  joint ventures in the prc and through a major marketing campaign through the indian subcontinent  including india  sri lanka and bangladesh 
in order to achieve this goal  we will be required to raise a certain amount of capital 
to a certain extent  these activities will have a significant impact on both liquidity and capital resources 
contractual obligations and commercial commitment we have entered into various contractual obligations  which may be summarized as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than years years thereafter year capital lease obligations    operating leases     cargo space commitments   material employment   agreements series a preferred stock and    cumulative dividends we have financed lease obligations of  as of december   of which  is repayable within one year  and  is repayable after one year 
we also entered into various lease commitments for office premises and warehouses in the united states  hong kong and china 
the total outstanding lease commitments under non cancelable operating leases are  as of december  as of december   the current portion of these commitments of  is payable within one year 
we have entered into written agreements with various sea and airfreight carriers committing to take up a guaranteed minimum amount of cargo space each year 
as of december   the amount outstanding for such commitments to be entered in was approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition of airgate international corporation  we also entered into three year employment agreements  dated april   with mr 
turner and mr 
zambuto  respectively  as described in a current report on form k filed on may  under these agreements  we agreed to pay each of them an annual base salary of  per annum commencing january   and for each year thereafter during the term of their employment agreements 
as of december   our commercial commitments may be summarized as follows other commercial total amounts amount of commitment expiration per period commitments committed less than year years line of credit   overdraft   invoice trust receipt   guarantees by bank   capital lease obligations    as of december   to finance our working capital  our available banking facilities were approximately  obtained from creditworthy commercial banks in hong kong and  from a bank in the us as of that date  the total amount of bank credit facilities utilized was  this was made up of i  of overdrafts  ii  of invoice trust receipts and iii  line of credit 
in additions  there are  of bank guarantees for granting credit facilities to a subsidiary for airfreight payment 
while these banks are not obligated to advance any further funds to us  we believe that absent any significant downtrend in business  these sources of credit will continue to be available to us 
outlook despite a global economic downturn  we believe the following factors may have a positive impact on our future results of operation and our financial conditions china s increased exports according to a recent research report issued by barrow street research  inc the barrow report between and  china s total exports grew eight times to over billion 
china s share of global exports is anticipated to reach in  a growth from the barrow report also states that china accounted for of the growth in the world economy  ranking second only to the us 
the rising trading power of china has been especially important for transportation companies 
with extensive operational centers based in hong kong and south china  management believes the company is well positioned to take advantage of this rapid growth in trade closer economic partnership the closer economic partnership arrangement cepa that was signed on june   originally focused on stimulating and enhancing hong kong s economic recovery 
in theory  cepa significantly lowers the barriers for hong kong enterprises to tap the mainland china market 
under the cepa  hong kong companies are permitted to set up wholly owned enterprises in mainland china to provide logistics services and related consultancy services for ordinary road freight  and to engage in the management and operation of logistics services through electronic means 
it permits freight forwarding agents to operate in mainland china on a wholly owned basis a full two years ahead of china s wto entrance timetable  and will permit such agents to enjoy national treatment in respect of the minimum registered capital requirement 
in addition  it eliminates the import tariffs to mainland china on a host of goods made in hong kong  allowing most hong kong companies to sell high value added products across the border 
in terms of economic benefits  the cepa has good potential to open up many new business opportunities in mainland china for hong kong 
although it is difficult to quantify the potential benefit we may realize from cepa  through our hong kong based agi logistics hk ltd  shenzhen careship transportation limited  as well as agi china ltd  we believe we can enjoy first mover advantage  that is  we believe that our hong kong based subsidiaries can benefit from cepa because we have experience in doing business in  and we believe that we are knowledgeable in the prc regulations and business practices 
we believe that our existing offices in hong kong and mainland china can also respond quicker than other us freight forwarders to ongoing developments in china 
outsourcing of non core activities companies are increasingly outsourcing freight forwarding  warehousing and other supply chain activities so that they may focus on their respective core competencies 
companies are increasingly turning to freight forwarders  and logistics and supply chain management providers  to manage their purchase orders and assure timely delivery of products at a lower cost and at greater efficiency than if the function was undertaken directly 
globalization of trade as barriers to international trade are gradually reduced  international trade will similarly increase 
in addition  companies are increasingly sourcing for supplies and raw materials from the most competitive suppliers throughout the world 
this form of sourcing would generally also lead to increased volumes of trade 
increased need for time definite delivery the demand for just in time and other time definite delivery has increased as a result of the globalization of manufacturing  greater implementation of demand driven supply chains  the shortening of product cycles and the increasing value of individual shipments 
a shift towards a decreasing number of global supply chain management provides companies are decreasing the number of freight forwarders and supply chain management providers with which they interact so that they might work with a limited number of providers who are familiar with their requirements  processes and procedures  and who can function as long term partners 
as such  freight forwarders that are globally integrated and are able to provide a full complement of services  including pick up and delivery  shipment via air  sea and land  warehousing and distribution and customs brokerage  are well positioned to gain from this shift 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of its business 
these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in short term interest rates 
the potential impact of the company s exposure to these risks is presented below foreign exchange risk the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies 
the company s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency  which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred 
this brings a market risk to the company s earnings 
foreign exchange rates sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company s earnings as a result of hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar  the company s functional currency  relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business 
as one of the major subsidiaries uses the hong kong dollar hkd  which has been linked to the us dollar at a rate of hkd to usd  as its functional currency  there has been no material change in the company s foreign exchange risk exposure 
however  if hkd was unlinked to the us dollar  an average weakening of the us dollar  throughout the year ended december   would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately  an average strengthening of the us dollar  for the same period  would have had the effect of reducing operating income by approximately  the company currently does not utilize any the derivate financial instruments or hedging transactions to manage foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk the company does not currently utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of  and short term borrowings of  all subject to variable short term interest rates 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate of would have an insignificant impact on the company s earnings 
in management s view  there has been no material change in company s market risk exposure between and
