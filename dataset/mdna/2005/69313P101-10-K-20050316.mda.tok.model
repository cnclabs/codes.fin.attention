historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included  and any trends which may appear to be inferred  should not be taken as being necessarily indicative of trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods 
we have made  and will continue to make  various forward looking statements with respect to financial and business matters 
comments regarding our business which are not historical facts are considered forward looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements

overview of key financial  strategic and performance factors our operating subsidiary  the park avenue bank  is an million community bank with branches and two loan production offices in georgia and florida 
we have offices in both smaller  rural communities as well as larger  metropolitan communities 
we provide traditional banking products and services to both commercial and individual customers in our markets 
for additional information on our markets  see the markets and competition section in part i of this report 
as a bank  we operate in a highly regulated and competitive environment 
our primary objective is to accept deposits and borrow additional funds as needed at low costs and invest those funds in a safe and sound manner in loans and investments at a higher yield in order to increase the return on our stockholders investment 
competition  regulation  credit risk  and interest rate risk are the primary factors that we must manage in order to be successful 
in terms of profitability  our return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe for was and  respectively 
the table below summarizes our net income  diluted earnings per share eps  roa and roe for the past five years 
year net income eps roa roe in thousands was a benchmark year for the company in terms of growth and profitability 
for the first time in five years  the company posted a double digit asset growth rate  an roa greater than  and a double digit roe 
our plan is to continue to deliver these results to our shareholders 
we want to continue to expand our presence in the higher growth markets in north georgia and florida  seek opportunities to enter new growth markets  and recapture lost market share in our south georgia markets 
a recap of what happened in and our subsequent progression follows 
in  we initiated several strategic changes we had changes in senior management  we began the process of consolidating our six separate bank charters into one  we engaged a new audit firm  and we switched our primary federal bank regulator from the fdic to the federal reserve 
problems with our credit quality and weaknesses in our credit administration began to surface as we implemented these changes 
in addition  as these changes were being made  the economy was in the midst of a recession and terrorists had attacked our country  further stressing the environment that we operated within 
our nonperforming loans rose from million at the beginning of to million at the end of that year 
during the fourth quarter of  the federal reserve began an examination of the bank that led to the identification of many of these problems 
as a result  we provided million to the allowance for loan losses during the fourth quarter of that basically negated our earnings for the entire year 
after the conclusion of their examination  on may   the federal reserve required our board of directors to adopt the resolution to improve the financial condition of the bank and correct the weaknesses identified in their examination 
in addition  the resolution restricted us from redeeming our capital stock  paying dividends  modifying existing debt agreements  or incurring additional debt without prior regulatory approval 
over the next months  little was accomplished that did not relate to addressing the provisions of the resolution 
on august   the federal reserve terminated the resolution with the company 
from the third quarter of  when our credit problems began to surface  to the third quarter of  when our resolution with the federal reserve was terminated  our balance sheet was in a period of contraction 
while part of the decline was due to the work out or charge off of certain loans  we also lost some business to former lenders and our competitors while our attention was diverted from business development 
in addition  we saw a decline in overall demand for loans with the down turn in the economy 
without the loan demand  we had to reduce our level of rate sensitive deposits in order to stabilize our earnings 
from the third quarter of to the third quarter of  our quarterly average balance of time deposits declined million  or 
during the same period of time  our quarterly average balance of demand and savings deposit accounts increased million  or  as we focused on retaining and attracting core  in market customer relationships 
we realize that some portion of that increase is possibly the result of our customers temporarily parking their excess liquidity due to lower interest rates and an overall lack of investment and capital spending in the economy during this period of time 
the table below shows our total loans and deposits at the end of each quarter since the end of the third quarter of as well as our net interest income and net interest margin for each of those quarters 
quarter ended loans deposits net interest income net interest margin dollars in thousands shown on a taxable equivalent basis in  our total loans increased million  or  on the strength of our north georgia market 
the majority of our loan growth was in commercial real estate lending  which is comprised of residential and commercial construction and development loans as well as owner occupied and income producing commercial real estate mortgages 
our construction and development loan portfolio increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  as a percentage of total loans  this portfolio increased from at the end of to at the end of the increase in this type of lending is representative of the overall economic growth and development of our north georgia and florida markets 
our commercial real estate mortgage portfolio increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  as a percentage of total loans  this portfolio increased only fractionally from at the end of to at the end of the return of loan demand generated the need to grow deposits and employ other funding sources 
while we eased back into a more competitive mode on our deposit pricing  we utilized third party brokered deposits  fhlb advances  fed funds purchased  and repurchase agreements to meet our interim funding needs 
the total increase in deposits for was million  or  and brokered deposits accounted for million of that increase 
we also added million in net additional advances with the fhlb in total stockholders equity increased million  or  during equity was increased primarily from the contribution of million from earnings net of million in dividends paid 
as a percentage of total assets  equity represented at end of  compared to at the beginning of  with the decrease resulting from an increase in assets during the year 
a breakdown of loans and deposits as of december  and and the percentage of net growth or contraction in for each market is provided in the table below

being in an asset sensitive interest rate position on our balance sheet our earning assets reprice more frequently than our rate sensitive liabilities  we expect to benefit during a period of rising interest rates 
however  if interest rates continue to rise and we continue to grow our balance sheet  we expect the incremental cost of those additional funds needed for such growth to be higher than our current cost of funds  which would offset some of the expected benefit in earnings 
this occurred during the fourth quarter of  as we increased deposits to fund loan growth 
the next two tables illustrate the effects of the continued repricing in interest rates and the changes in the volume of loans and deposits on our net interest income 
rate volume analysis the following table shows a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense on a fully taxable equivalent basis resulting from changes in volume and changes in rates for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between years to average balances outstanding in the later year 
the change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the earlier year to the change in average balances outstanding between years 
thus  changes that are not solely due to volume have been consistently attributed to rate

the bonds which are purchased as investments carry an a rating or better by either standard and poor s or moody s investors service  inc or have been reviewed for credit and market risk and deemed appropriate for the bank s portfolio by management 
the portfolio is monitored to assure there is no unreasonable concentration of securities in the obligations of a single debtor

the maturities presented for mortgage backed securities are based on the average lives of those bonds at the then projected prepayment speeds

in  loans in our north georgia market increased and loans in our florida market increased 
while these are relatively new markets for us and some level of growth is expected  the growth that we have experienced from these markets can be attributed to the addition of experienced lenders with contacts in these markets  and strong local economic activity 
our ability to continue to grow in these markets is dependent upon a continuation of these favorable attributes

this preference has contributed to our asset sensitive interest rate risk position 
at december   approximately of our loan portfolio will either mature or reprice within the next twelve months 
nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the amount of nonperforming loans outstanding at the indicated dates is presented in the following table by category 
as of december  dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis accruing loans which are contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments troubled debt restructurings not included above other impaired loans total nonperforming loans ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans we have continued to improve our asset quality by working down our levels of nonperforming loans and monitoring our portfolio for potential problem loans to promptly resolve any material issues that might arise 
in december  we discovered that a million commercial real estate loan originated from our hall county office was not as it was represented for approval in october with the help of counsel  we have investigated the situation to minimize our potential risk exposure  but we still have not reached a final conclusion on this credit 
we engaged another appraiser to provide as is values for the property to support our loans  and we are working with the borrower  the contractors  and the tenants to ensure completion of the project 
we believe that we have sufficient reserves  allocated to these loans as of december  these loans were not considered impaired as of year end  however  in february  we placed this loan and a related  loan on nonaccrual status as it became evident that the borrower would be unable to perform under the terms of the notes 
obviously  these loans will increase our level of nonperforming loans for the first quarter of at december   we had million in total delinquent loans loans past due days or more  or of total loans 
this is an improvement from one year ago and a recent high of at march  the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when  in our judgment  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due  unless the loan is well secured 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income 
interest income on nonaccrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received until the loan is returned to accrual status 
for the year ended december   the gross interest income that would have been recorded if our nonperforming loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was approximately  the amount of interest income on the above nonperforming loans that was included in net income for the year ended december  was approximately  the allowance for loan losses related to our nonperforming loans amounted to approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  due to a decline in specific reserves on loans individually evaluated for impairment 
allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance as a percent of total loans was  compared to at december  we consider the current level of the allowance for loan losses adequate to absorb losses from loans in the portfolio 
as an integral part of our credit risk management process  we regularly review loans in our portfolio for credit quality and documentation of collateral 
the lenders are primarily responsible for assigning a risk grade to each loan in their portfolio 
their assessments are supplemented with independent reviews conducted by our internal audit department and external loan review consultants 
all loans in excess of  that have been identified for potential credit weakness are reviewed quarterly by a management committee to further enhance the process for timely recognition of losses and for determining appropriate reserves 
we have a comprehensive methodology for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
we perform an allowance analysis at least quarterly that is broken down into three components specific allowances for individual loans  allowances for pools of loans identified by credit risk grades or delinquency status  and general allowances for all other loans pooled by loan type 
a management committee has the responsibility for assessing the risk elements  determining the specific allowance valuations  and affirming the methodology used 
the board of directors reviews management s assessment and affirms the amount recorded 
the first component of the allowance for loan loss methodology covers the measurement of specific allowances for individual impaired loans as required by financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
each loan relationship with amounts due in excess of  that has been identified for potential credit weakness is evaluated for impairment 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
by definition  we consider all loans on nonaccrual status and all loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring as impaired 
if impairment is determined  a specific valuation is assessed on that loan based on realizable collateral values if collateral dependent  discounted cash flows  or observable market values 
at december   we had million in specific reserves on million in individually evaluated impaired and other significant potential problem loans 
this is a decrease from the million in specific reserves on million in individually evaluated loans at december  the second component of the allowance for loan loss methodology addresses all loans not individually evaluated for impairment but are either internally rated  criticized by our banking examiners  or past due day or more 
the allowance factors are based on industry standards and supported by our own historical loss analysis 
at december   we had million in general reserves allocated to million rated and delinquent loans 
this is a decrease from the million reserved on million rated and delinquent loans at december  the decrease is due to continued improvement in the more severe rating categories over the past months 
the third component addresses general allowances on all loans not individually reserved due to impairment  rating or delinquency status 
these loans are divided into smaller homogenous groups based on loan type 
the allowances are determined by applying loss factors to each pool of loans with similar characteristics 
the factors used are based on the three year historical loss percentages for each pool adjusted by current known and documented internal and external environmental factors 
the environmental factors considered in developing our loss measurements include levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending policies  procedures  and practices  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  and effects of changes in credit concentrations 
the quantitative risk factors used in determining these general reserves require a high degree of management judgment 
at december   we had million in general reserves compared to million one year ago 
while we have seen improving trends in may of the environmental factors  the general reserve increased slightly over last year primarily due to additional caution taken into consideration for our increased concentration in residential construction lending and our entering into new markets 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
while we use the best information available to make the evaluation  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions or other environmental factors 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses  and may require the bank to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses we have allocated the allowance for credit losses according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary at each year end to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within the categories of loans set forth in the table below 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category 
the components of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five years are presented below

the average rate paid on time deposits dropped basis points from in to in the decrease in rate on these deposits allowed us to improve our net interest margin and keep our net interest income from falling to a less profitable level 
while we have historically enjoyed a relatively low cost of funds from our core deposits  with the current rising rate environment and our plan to grow the balance sheet  we do not expect to be able to sustain these low levels of interest rates on deposits 
the maturities of time deposits of  or more as of december  are summarized below 
amount in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six months through one year over one year total liquidity and capital resources liquidity is an important factor in our financial condition and affects our ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers 
assets  consisting primarily of loans and investment securities  are funded by customer deposits  borrowed funds  and retained earnings 
maturities in the investment and loan portfolios also provide a steady flow of funds for reinvestment 
in addition  our liquidity continues to be enhanced by a relatively stable core deposit base and the availability of additional funding sources 
at december   our liquidity ratio was and our net noncore funding dependency ratio was 
our liquidity and funding policy provides that we should maintain a liquidity position of greater than or equal to and a net noncore funding dependency ratio of less than or equal to 
due to our reliance on brokered deposits and fhlb advances for funding during the fourth quarter  we exceeded our policy limit in the net noncore funding dependency ratio at year end 
since year end we are aware of no trends or events likely to result in a material change in our ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers 
investment portfolio the bank s investment portfolio is another primary source of liquidity 
maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds that are available for cash needs 
contractual investment securities that mature within one year totaled  at december  however  mortgage backed securities and securities with call provisions create cash flows earlier than the contractual maturities 
estimates of prepayments on mortgage backed securities and call provisions on federal agency and state and municipals increase the forecasted cash flows from the investment portfolio 
our liquidity from investments is somewhat limited since we pledge certain investments to secure public deposits  certain borrowing arrangements  and for other purposes 
at december   approximately of our million investment portfolio was pledged as collateral to others 
borrowings as with most community banks  loan volume is the driver for the remainder of our balance sheet 
since our loan volume has grown million this past year  we have become more aggressive in retaining time deposits 
as a result  total time deposits have increased million  or  since december  of this million in time deposit growth  million are in the form of brokered deposits 
to further fund this loan growth  we borrowed million in advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta the fhlb during during  we incurred a million prepayment penalty to repay million in fhlb advances that had a remaining average life to maturity of over five years 
the average rate on these advances was basis points higher than the federal funds rate at that time that we purchased to retire the advances 
on november   pab bankshares capital trust i pab trust issued million of floating rate capital securities  also referred to as trust preferred securities 
we formed pab trust  a statutory business trust created under the laws of the state of delaware  for the sole purpose of issuing the trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds in floating rate junior subordinated debentures issued by us 
the interest rates on both the trust preferred securities and the debentures are reset semi annually at libor plus currently with a rate cap of through december  we entered into agreements which  taken collectively  fully  irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee  on a subordinated basis  all of pab trust s obligations under the trust preferred securities 
pab trust s sole asset is the debentures issued by us 
the debentures will mature on december   but are callable at par at our option in whole or in part anytime after december  the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital under the risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve 
during the first quarter of  the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
r revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation addresses consolidation by business entities of variable interest entities and when such entities are subject to consolidation under the provisions of this interpretation 
the company has determined that the revised provisions required deconsolidation of pab bankshares capital trust i 
the interpretation did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
at december   we had million in an available secured credit line with the fhlb and an additional million in unsecured fed funds lines of credit available with correspondent banks 
contractual obligations summarized below are our contractual obligations as of december  year over over more than contractual obligations total or less to years to years years dollars in thousands fhlb advances operating lease obligations guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in debentures off balance sheet financing our financial statements do not reflect various commitments and contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business 
these off balance sheet financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these financial instruments are included in the financial statements when funds are distributed or the instruments become payable 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and credit card commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
at december   we had outstanding commitments to extend credit through open lines of credit of approximately million and outstanding standby letters of credit of approximately million 
commitments of capital at december   we had accepted a bid to replace eight of our atm s for approximately  and to add two additional atm s for a cost of approximately  although we have no commitments  locations identified  or regulatory approval applications in process  we have budgeted to add up to two branches during in april  we intend to open a loan production office in cobb county 
we expect to enter into a lease agreement for the planned space and we have budgeted up to  to furnish and equip the office to meet our needs

our net interest income for  on a tax equivalent basis  increased by  or  over interest income increased  or  while interest expense decreased by  or  during the increase in interest income is the net result of an increase of million in our average earning assets and a basis point drop in the average yield on earning assets during the year  from in to in the majority of the decrease in interest expense is the result of a decline in rates

our net interest margin increased from in to in  a basis point improvement 
although our net interest margin improved during  our ability to continue to improve our net interest margin in will be a challenge considering the current flattening of the interest rate curve and our rising incremental cost of funds 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the charge to operating earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
through the provision  we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
however  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on growth in the loan portfolio  changes in economic conditions and other internal and external environmental factors 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination procedures  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses 
for the year ended december   we recorded  as a provision for loan losses  compared to no provision recorded for the same period in the increase is due to a growing loan portfolio  balanced by continued improvement in the level of total nonperforming loans  and an improvement in several environmental factors previously discussed

in addition  the fee income generated from an overdraft privilege product that was launched in march and resulted in an increase in revenues in and has continued to decline since then 
mortgage origination fees continued to decline in due to a decrease in the refinancing activity during the year

legal and accounting fees decreased by in this decrease is due primarily to the drop in legal expense associated with the collection and recovery of problem loans 
the cost of acquiring  maintaining  and repairing foreclosed other real estate owned and other repossessed property included in other noninterest expense increased  or  to  in  from  in and  in  due to an increase in activity in and all other major expense categories have decreased due to efficiencies gained from the charter consolidation process  the utilization of technology  and tighter budgeting and cost control measures 
income taxes the provision for income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income was   and for  and  respectively 
the difference between the effective rate and the statutory federal rate of is due primarily to income earned on our investments in and loans to tax exempt municipalities and earnings on the cash value of our bank owned life insurance

impact of inflation inflation impacts the growth in total assets in the banking industry and causes a need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates to meet capital adequacy requirements 
we cope with the effects of inflation through managing our interest rate sensitivity gap position  by periodically reviewing and adjusting our pricing of services to consider current costs  and through managing our dividend payout policy relative to our level of income 
there has been minimal inflation experienced in the last three years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and the related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates and assumptions which effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that our determination of the allowance for loan losses and the fair value of assets  including the impairment of goodwill  affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are described in detail in note of our consolidated financial statements provided in item of this report 
the following is a brief description of the company s critical accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgment 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors including  but not limited to  reviews and evaluations of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on segments of the loan portfolio  historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on either the fair value of the underlying collateral  the present value of the future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  or the estimated market value of the loan 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions eg  discount rate and methodologies eg  comparison to the recent selling price of similar assets consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
management s assessment is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
changes in various internal and external environmental factors including  but not limited to  the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience  or the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
should these environmental factors change  a different amount may be reported for the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimates of fair value the estimation of fair value is significant to a number of the company s assets  including  but not limited to  investment securities  goodwill  other real estate owned  and other repossessed assets 
these are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors 
circumstances that could cause estimates of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities to change include a change in prepayment speeds  discount rates  or market interest rates 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
fair values for most investment securities are based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of fair value are also required in performing an impairment analysis of goodwill 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment would be indicated if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit 
recent accounting pronouncements in management s opinion  there are no recent accounting pronouncements that have had a material impact on pab s earnings or financial position as of or for the year ended december  for more detailed disclosure on recent accounting developments  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to exposure from us dollar interest rate changes and accordingly  we manage our exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
we do not engage in trading activity nor do we classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
we do not engage in any hedging activities or enter into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than mortgage backed securities  which are commonly held pass through securities 
finally  we have no material direct exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of our asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
it is our policy to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon between and 
however  with interest rates at historic lows and the shape of the interest rate curve  the company has exceeded policy limits by adjusting the balance sheet to a more asset sensitive position 
at december   our one year management adjusted gap ratio of was outside of our policy guidelines due to our preference to offer floating rate loans over fixed rate loans at this time 
this exception to policy  while monitored closely  is an acceptable risk that positions our financial condition to benefit from an increase in interest rates 
the table below has two measures of gap  regulatory and management adjusted 
the regulatory gap considers only contractual maturities or repricings 
the management adjusted gap includes assumptions regarding prepayment speeds on certain rate sensitive assets  the repricing frequency of interest bearing demand and savings accounts  and the stability of core deposit levels  all of which are adjusted periodically as market conditions change 
the management adjusted gap indicates we are highly asset sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates in the short term 
being asset sensitive would result in net interest income increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a declining rate environment 
cumulative repricing gap analysis month month year dollars in thousands regulatory defined rate sensitive assets rsa rate sensitive liabilities rsl rsa minus rsl gap gap ratio rsa rsl management adjusted rate sensitive assets rsa rate sensitive liabilities rsl rsa minus rsl gap gap ratio rsa rsl we use simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining  and flat interest rate scenarios allows us to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to increases or decreases in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
as of year end  the simulation model projected net interest income would increase over the next year if market rates immediately rose by basis points 
on the other hand  the model projected net interest income to decrease over the next year if market rates immediately fell by basis points 
the high volatility in our results is due primarily to our asset sensitive balance sheet mix and our behavioral assumptions for repricing and prepayment speeds 
our policy states that net interest income cannot be reduced by more than using this analysis  and technically  we were outside of policy guidelines at year end 
however  this exception was mitigated because a further basis point drop was not realistic given that the federal funds rate stood at 
if market rates immediately fell by basis points  a more plausible but still unlikely scenario  our model projected net interest income to decrease over the next year 
the following table shows the results of these projections for net interest income expressed as a percentage change over net interest income in a flat rate scenario for both a gradual change in market interest rates over a twelve month period and an immediate change  or shock  in market interest rates
