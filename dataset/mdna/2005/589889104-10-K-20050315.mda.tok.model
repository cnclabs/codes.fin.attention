the company s revenues increased notwithstanding the fact that the markets for many of the company s products are experiencing slight pricing declines  therefore substantially all of the increase in the company s revenues was attributable to increased unit sales  except for an increase in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar which increased sales by in compared to  in compared to  and

the slight decrease in gross margin percentage in  compared to  was the result of a slight increase in the standard costs per unit as the result of increased manufacturing costs 
the increase in the gross margin percentage for over  and improvement in over  was primarily affected by an increase in efficiency and productivity gains achieved primarily by the company s operations groups 
these productivity gains have been achieved primarily by enhanced employee productivity  which management believes was encouraged by merit s bonus program  streamlined production layouts and investments in manufacturing equipment which have improved efficiencies 
with these improved efficiencies  merit s cost per unit for many of its products has decreased as unit sales have grown  notwithstanding slight increases in fixed overhead costs 
gross profit was also favorable for over  and over  primarily due to an increase in the exchange rate of the euro against the us dollar  resulting in an increase in gross profit of and  respectively

during  the company expects gross margins to decline as a result of higher overhead expenses attributable to moving into the new buildings discussed above  integrating the lower margin pack sales of medsource  and bringing on several new products which are anticipated to have a negative effect on margins until 
management believes  however  that if the company is successful in increasing production volumes according to current plans  the increased production will offset some of the effect of the lower margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or in over  million  or in over  and million  or in over the increase in selling  general and administrative costs for  compared to  was primarily the result of approximately  in costs associated with merit s efforts to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and severance costs of approximately  related to the termination of certain employees

the company s effective tax rates for   and were   and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for over was mostly due to lower taxable income in for the company s irish operations  which are taxed at a lower rate than the us operations 
the change in taxable income for ireland from to was the result of increased costs associated with the development of a new product  which is scheduled to be released during the effective tax rate for was  up slightly from in  mostly because the foreign sales corporation and r d tax benefits were diluted by a increase in income from operations

management believes that its present sources of liquidity and capital are adequate for the current operations and for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the sec has requested that all registrants address their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the representation of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates could occur in the future from period to period 
management has discussed the development  and selection of the company s most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the following paragraphs identify the company s most critical accounting policies inventory obsolescence reserve the company s management reviews on a regular basis inventory quantities on hand for unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
this review of inventory quantities for unmarketable and or slow moving products is based on estimates of forecasted product demand prior to expiration lives 
if market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we believe that the amount included in our obsolescence reserve has been an historically accurate estimate of the unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
the company s obsolescence reserve was approximately million as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of the company s receivables are with hospitals  which over the company s history have demonstrated favorable collections 
therefore  the company has experienced minimal bad debts from hospital customers and similar write offs associated with some of the company s international distributors  typically as a result of terminating a distributor within a foreign country 
the most significant write offs over the company s history have come from us packers who bundle merit s products in surgical trays 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based upon historical experience and a review of individual customer balances 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company s bad debt reserve was  at december   which is in line with historical collection experience 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock compensation arrangements under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and intends to continue to do so 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock compensation arrangements 
if the compensation cost for the company s compensation plans had been determined consistent with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  the company s net income and net income per common and common share equivalent would have changed to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands except per share data net income as reported compensation cost under fair value based accounting method net of tax net income pro forma net income per common share basic as reported pro forma diluted as reported pro forma in applying the black scholes methodology to the option grants  the company used the following assumptions year ended december  risk free interest rate expected option life years years years expected price volatility for options with a vesting period  compensation expense is recognized on a ratable basis over the service period which corresponds to the vesting period 
compensation expense is recognized immediately for options that are fully vested on the date of grant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro relative to the value of the us dollar 
the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in  and the company s principal currency is  the us dollar 
a portion of the company s revenues in million  representing approximately of aggregate revenues came from sales that were denominated in euros 
certain of the company s expenses are also denominated in euros  partially offsetting any risk associated with fluctuations of the euro dollar exchange rate 
because of the company s euro denominated revenues and expenses  in a year in which the company s euro denominated revenues exceed its euro based expenses  the value of such euro denominated net income increases if the value of the euro increases relative to the value of the us dollar  and decreases if the value of the euro decreases relative to the value of the u 
s 
dollar 
during  the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar resulted in an increase of the company s gross revenues of million and in gross profit 
at december   the company had a net exposure representing the difference between euro denominated receivables and euro denominated payables of approximately  in order to partially offset such risk  at december   the company entered into a day forward euro hedge contract 
the company enters into similar hedging transactions at various times during the year to partially offset exchange rate risks it bears throughout the year 
the company does not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during the year ended december   the company experienced a net loss of approximately  on hedging transactions it executed during in an effort to limit its exposure to fluctuations in the euro dollar exchange rate 
another market risk relates to variable rate debt 
as of december   the company had no variable rate debt 
as long as the company does not have variable rate debt  the company s interest expense would not be affected by changes in interest rates
