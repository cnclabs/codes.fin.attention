item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  and for each of the three years in the period then ended should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth elsewhere in this report 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  including our expectations of future industry conditions  strategic plans and forecasts of operational results 
various risks may cause our actual results to differ materially 
a list and description of some of the risks and uncertainties is contained below and in the summary of risk factors included in item overview decode is a biopharmaceutical company applying its discoveries in human genetics to develop drugs for common diseases 
our population approach and resources enable us to isolate genes and drug targets directly involved in the development of many of the biggest challenges to public health 
we are turning these discoveries into a growing pipeline of therapeutics aimed at combating the causes of disease  not just the signs and symptoms 
as these diseases are common and current therapies are of limited effectiveness  we believe that our strategy represents a significant opportunity to create better medicine with major potential in the global marketplace 
we believe that decode s advantage derives from our population approach to human genetics and the ability to apply this approach across the drug development process 
in iceland  we have comprehensive population resources that enable our scientists to efficiently conduct genome and population wide scans to identify key genes and gene variations contributing to common diseases 
the proteins encoded by these genes  and other proteins with which they interact in the disease pathway  offer drug targets that are directly involved in the onset and progression of disease 
small molecule drugs that target these proteins therefore represent a direct means of modulating the onset or progression of the disease 
our goal is to bring to market new drugs for major indications  and in so doing make the company profitable and create value for our shareholders 
to achieve this goal we must ensure that we have the capabilities and financial means to expand and advance our pipeline through the long  risky and expensive process of drug development and on to the market 
this requires us to constantly evaluate the optimal balance between several factors  including the level of our investment in research and development  the preservation of cash resources and their deployment for product development  and the financing environment 
in order to support our drug development infrastructure  to focus the use of our cash resources on our proprietary therapeutics programs  and to diversify risk in our overall drug development portfolio  we leverage our capabilities to form corporate alliances and to provide services to fee paying customers 
we have formed drug and other product development alliances with roche and merck  among others 
in addition to conducting work on our targets in our collaborative and internal programs  our medicinal chemistry subsidiary provides drug discovery services and contract manufacturing of therapeutic compounds for human clinical trials for our fee for service customers 
our other service offerings include protein crystallization products  protein crystallization instruments and protein structure analysis contract services through our structural biology subsidiary  clinical trials services though our wholly owned subsidiary encode  and dna analysis services through our genotyping laboratory in reykjavik 
we currently derive revenues primarily from research funding and other fees from our service customers and collaborative partners  milestone payments and upfront  exclusivity  technology access and technology development fees under our collaboration agreements constitute most of the rest of our revenues 
while we are entitled to royalties or profit sharing under the terms of our agreements  due to the extended time period for the development and commercialization of a saleable product or therapy  we have not yet received royalties or profit sharing under any of our contracts and do not expect to do so for several years  if at all 
our expenses consist primarily of research and development expenses 
we believe that advancing our drug development programs  particularly the conduct of clinical trials on a growing number of our compounds  will require significant and increasing expenditures 
in we anticipate that we will be conducting clinical trials for dg  dg  and in asthma 
we also expect to be advancing our preclinical work on our follow on compound in heart attack and in our pde inhibitor program for vascular disease stroke  and expect to bring these programs into clinical development following the submission of ind applications 
we anticipate incurring additional net losses at least through the next several years  due to  in addition to the above mentioned factors  depreciation and amortization  as well as stock based compensation and other non cash charges 
we expect that our revenues and losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial  especially because progress in our scientific work and milestone payments that are related to progress can fluctuate between quarters 
we do not believe that comparisons of our quarter to quarter performance are a good indication of future performance 
following our sale of  of our senior convertible notes in april   we believe that we have sufficient cash resources to continue to fund our operations for several years 
however  we will require significant additional capital in the future for our product development programs and so will continue to investigate additional avenues of financing 
our ability to obtain capital will be affected by conditions in the global financial markets and in the pharmaceutical industry 
we expect that downturns in the market valuations of biotechnology companies and of the equity markets more generally will restrict our ability to raise additional capital on attractive terms  while more favorable conditions in those markets will present opportunities for us 
the difficulties facing the pharmaceutical industry present for us both near term challenges and significant longer term opportunities 
one of the main issues confronting big pharmaceutical companies is their lack of promising new drugs to treat major indications 
as many leading brand name drugs come off patent and face generic competition  developing successful new medicines will become critical for filling the gap 
in the short term  the financial pressures on pharmaceutical companies may be reflected in their research and development spending  making it more difficult for us to sign corporate alliances with significant up front funding  or lengthening the time required to negotiate such deals 
we believe that in the medium to longer term  however  companies such as ours may be well positioned to play an important role in filling the gap in the pipeline of new drugs  either alone or as partners of pharmaceutical companies 
our partnerships with roche and merck demonstrate that the industry is already investing in the development of new therapeutics based on our approach 
acquisitions and in licensing as part of our business strategy  we continue to consider joint development programs and merger and acquisition opportunities that may provide us with products in late stage development  intellectual property or financial resources  or with capabilities that will help accelerate our downstream drug discovery efforts 
in certain programs we have taken advantage of the fact that drug targets we have identified through our genetics research have already been employed by other companies to make developmental compounds for other indications 
by licensing these compounds or entering into co development arrangements we have been able to leapfrog over several years of drug discovery  entering directly into phase ii clinical trials 
in we successfully completed a phase iia clinical trial for dg  the compound we licensed from bayer healthcare ag and which we are developing for the prevention of heart attack 
in we entered into an agreement with another company to conduct a phase ii trial in for a compound developed originally for a different indication 
we continue to investigate additional such possibilities for the in licensing or co development of promising existing compounds that may effectively act against targets we have identified through our gene discovery work 
on march   we acquired medichem life sciences  inc in a stock for stock exchange accounted for as a purchase transaction 
the total consideration for the acquisition was million 
the acquisition of medichem is a central element in our strategy to transform decode from a company focused on gene discovery into a biopharmaceutical company capable of creating and capturing the greatest possible value from its discovery capabilities 
the acquisition has benefited us in three ways enabling us to advance our in house programs in drug discovery  enabling us to negotiate much more favorable terms in our alliances with pharmaceutical companies  in which we take our discoveries much further down the drug development process and receive a more significant share of revenues from sales of products that are developed  and providing us with a service business generating revenue in the short term and maintain the infrastructure for conducting drug discovery work on several programs at once 
our statements of operations include the results of medichem from the date of acquisition 
research and development programs the following is a summary of the development of our drug candidates in late pre clinical or clinical development 
because of uncertainties involved in the drug development process  the actual timing for the events described below may differ materially from that provided in this summary 
our most advanced developmental compound is dgo for the prevention of heart attack 
in we conducted a phase iia clinical trial for dg in iceland 
we have submitted an ind for dg with the us food and drug administration fda and expect to make similar filings in selected european countries 
based on the results of the phase iia trial and pending fda approval  we expect to begin a phase iii outcome trial in the us  iceland and europe for dg in the third quarter of dg is our lead compound for the treatment of atherosclerosis of the legs  or peripheral arterial occlusive disease paod 
dg is an inhibitor of a g protein coupled receptor gpcr which our genetics work has shown to be associated with a significantly increased risk of developing the disease 
our ind application for dg was accepted by the fda in february and on this basis we began the first phase trial for this compound in the us in march of we expect the trial will be of weeks duration 
in asthma  we expect to commence a phase ii trial in iceland with a third party compound in the first half of this compound acts against a target our genetics work has shown to be involved in the development of asthma 
we are developing a follow on compound for dg that is designed to inhibit the lta hydrolase  a protein encoded by a second gene within the same pathway targeted by dg that we have also linked to significantly increased risk of heart attack 
we have begun a pde inhibitor program for vascular disease stroke pursuant to our agreement with roche 
we use many of our employee and infrastructure resources across several programs  and many of our research and development costs are indirectly attributable to an individually named program or are directed broadly to applicable research programs 
however  taking into account costs that are specifically attributable to individual programs and allocations of our research and development program costs based upon those direct costs in and  we have cumulatively invested   and million in our mi  paod  stroke and asthma programs  respectively  from the beginning of to year end inception to date costs are not available as these costs were not historically tracked by program 
we have not applied for or received marketing approval from the applicable regulatory authorities in any country for any of our drug candidates 
in order for us to achieve marketing approval in the us  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish the safety and efficacy of our drug candidate 
other countries have similar requirements 
historically  the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials through phase ii have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
many new compounds have shown promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary marketing approvals 
additional risks and uncertainties involved in the development and commercialization of any products are described further in item above 
we expect that it will be several years  if ever  before we receive revenues from the commercial sale of our therapeutic products 
furthermore  our strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products  such as our collaboration agreements with roche and merck 
entering into a collaboration with a partner at any point in the development or commercialization of a product is a business decision of ours 
when making this decision we do and will consider  among other matters  the complexity of the indication  the size  complexity and expense of necessary development and or commercialization efforts  the nature and size of the applicable market  an assessment of our own resources financial and operational  and an assessment of the resources of a potential partner 
in the event that we do collaborate on any of the above programs in the future  a partner will have a level of control  which may be significant  over the pre clinical development or clinical trial process for a product 
as a result the completion date of such a partnered program could largely be under control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary drug candidate will be subject to future collaborative arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  which include  among others  those related to revenue recognition  property and equipment  intangible assets  materials and supplies  derivative financial instruments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the impact and any associated risks related to these and our other accounting policies on our business or operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  please refer to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from the estimates referred to above 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgements about matters that are inherently uncertain 
collaborations and revenue 
our collaborative arrangements and the recognition of revenue in such arrangements is the accounting policy most critical to us 
a substantial portion of our revenues relate to funded research collaborations 
our revenues from research and development collaboration agreements are recorded and recognized in accordance with the applicable performance requirements and terms of the respective contracts  generally either i as contract research costs are incurred  usually ratably over the period of effort  ii according to the level of efforts expended based on the ratio of contract research costs incurred to expected total costs  or iii upon the achievement of substantive milestones 
our accounting recognition policies with respect to each significant element of our revenue is summarized as follows research funding and other service fees 
research funding is recognized as earned  typically ratably over the period of effort 
funding payments are not refundable in the event that the related efforts are not successful 
other service revenues from negotiated rate contracts are recognized based upon the terms of the underlying contract generally either i on a per diem basis as services are rendered  ii on the basis of efforts expended  generally upon the ratio of costs incurred to total expected costs of providing the service  or iii upon completion of the service rendered 
any losses on contracts are provided for when they are determinable 
included in revenue are billings to customers for the cost of materials purchased by decode 
milestone payments 
in arrangements with multiple elements entered into before june  where i the milestone event is substantive  ii there is substantial effort involved in achieving the milestone  iii the milestone payment amount is commensurate with the magnitude of the related achievement  and iv the associated follow on revenue streams bear a reasonable relationship to one another  we recognize revenue using the substantive milestone method 
under the substantive milestone method decode records revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and we recognize revenue when acknowledgement of achievement of applicable performance requirements is received from the collaborator 
milestone payments without the above characteristics are recognized on a retrospective basis over the contractual term of the underlying agreement 
in arrangements with multiple elements entered into after june   if the milestone is substantive in nature and there is uncertainty in the achievement of the milestone and there is no further obligation on our part  we record revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and we recognize revenue when acknowledgement of achievement of applicable performance requirements is received from the collaborator milestone payment method 
if the milestone is earned and we have no further obligation under the contract for performance  then we will record revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and we retroactively recognize revenue through the current period based on the total contractual term and amortizes the balance over the remaining contractual term 
up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees 
we recognize revenue from non refundable fees not specifically tied to a separate earnings process ratably over the expected customer relationship period or estimated period of performance 
changes in estimates could impact revenue in the period the estimate is changed 
if our estimate of the period of performance shortens or lengthens  the amount of revenue we recognize from such non refundable fees not specifically tied to a separate earnings process could increase or decrease in the period the change in estimate becomes known  future related revenues would be adjusted accordingly 
revenue estimates are reviewed and revised throughout the lives of our contracts and are made based upon current facts and circumstances 
if changes in these estimates or other material adjustments to revenue are identified  the adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions will be recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
other 
we consider certain other accounting matters related to property and equipment  materials and supplies  foreign exchange transactions  income taxes and litigation and other contingencies to also be important policies for us 
long lived assets 
we periodically review property and equipment for potential impairments and to assess whether their service lives have been affected by continued technological change and development 
in september of  we implemented a cost reduction program and reduced total worldwide headcount by approximately employees  focusing in particular on utilizing ongoing process automation and increased productivity in the core genetics operations in reykjavik 
stemming from this initiative and together with our consideration of significant and pervasive declines in the market environment for pharmaceutical and biotech industries  we determined that impairment tests of the carrying value of our goodwill and other long lived assets  including the long lived assets acquired through the medichem acquisition  should be performed 
we completed these tests and recorded impairments and write downs of goodwill  property  intangibles and equipment amounting to million for the year ended december  there were no events in and that triggered an impairment review nor did our annual review indicate any recoverability issues 
should we determine that there has been further impairment of our fixed assets  goodwill or other intangible assets in the future we would suffer an increase to our net loss or a reduction of our net income in the period such a determination is made 
in light of experience and the current technological environment  in we changed certain of our salvage value and useful life estimates for equipment and furniture and fixtures for purposes of depreciation 
these changes in estimates had the effect in increasing depreciation expense in by million 
should we determine that the pace of technological change or other matters dictate that we change the service lives or other estimates inherent in determining the carrying values of our long lived assets  there will be an impact on depreciation expense from the date of the change 
materials and supplies 
we value our materials and supplies at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
we apply judgment in determining necessary provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete materials and supplies based on historical experience and anticipated usage  giving effect to general market conditions 
any rapid technological changes or future business developments could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete materials and supplies on hand 
furthermore  if our estimates of our needs for materials and supplies prove to be inaccurate  additional provision may be required for incremental excess and obsolete items 
we recorded charges for write down of obsolete and excess materials and supplies of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in and  we used materials and supplies for which we had made provisions for in prior years as slow moving  excess and obsolete  benefiting otherwise reported operating expenses by million and million  respectively 
foreign exchange transactions 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
however  in light of the significance of our operations outside the united states  an important element of our cost base is or will be denominated in icelandic krona  including much of our payroll and other operating expenses and some of our long term borrowings 
as a consequence of the nature our business and operations  our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
to manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates  we have entered into and will likely continue to enter into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to such fluctuations 
the net impact of foreign exchange on the translated amount of our non us dollar denominated liabilities  net together with transaction gains and losses  amounted to losses of million for the year ended december  the continued weakening of the us dollar compared to the icelandic krona during has been significant and these currency fluctuations may continue to adversely affect our financial results 
income taxes 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes  including interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  future research and development spending and future levels of capital expenditures 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets resulting from deductible operating losses and other items 
due primarily to our history of operating losses and the expectation that such losses will continue into the foreseeable future  we have concluded that currently insufficient positive evidence exists to justify the recognition of our net deferred tax assets in our balance sheet 
although there can be no assurance that losses generated to date will be used to offset future taxable income  an adjustment to the valuation of our current net deferred tax assets in the future would increase income in the period that we made a determination that such an adjustment was appropriate 
income tax in iceland is payable in icelandic krona 
consequently  the us dollar value of our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets and liabilities is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates 
such fluctuations over time may increase or reduce the reported us dollar balance of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and there would be a corresponding gain or loss reported in our income statement 
litigation and other contingencies 
we consider litigation and other claims and potential claims or contingencies in preparing our financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles 
we maintain accruals for litigation and other contingencies when we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimated 
in doing so  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes with respect to legal and other matters as well as potential of probable losses 
we base our accruals on information available at the time of such determination 
changes or developments in the relevant action or our strategy in such proceedings could materially affect our results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
since the recognition of a loss is dependent upon factors not completely in the control of management  timing of a charge  if any  is difficult to predict with certainty 
results of operations from the years ended december   and our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future based upon  among other things  the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  as well as the progress of our own research and development efforts 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon collaborative partners  development by us or our competitors of new technological innovations  ability to market products or services  dependence on key personnel  dependence on key suppliers  protection of proprietary technology  ability to obtain additional financing  ability to negotiate collaborative arrangements  and compliance with governmental and other regulations 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic or diagnostic products for a period of years  if at all 
financial highlights for the year ended december  include at the close of  we had million in cash and investments 
this includes restricted cash and investments million  and reflects the net proceeds from our million convertible notes issue completed in april research and development expense for proprietary programs was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to is the result principally of costs associated with our recently completed phase iia trial of dg  preparations for planned upcoming clinical trials of dg and of dg  and the effect of the one time  non cash reversal of accrued license fees in our revenue for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these revenues reflect the gradual redeployment of development capabilities from service partnerships to development of new drugs  as well as variability in the amount and timing of milestone and other payments related to our product development alliances 
importantly  our ability to generate revenue enables us to offset a portion of the cost of our investment in r d  including expenses related to the clinical development of our lead compounds 
our cost of revenue  including costs incurred in connection with collaborative programs  decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreases result mainly from the streamlining and automation of our core genetics research and operations 
our cost of revenue consists of the costs of services provided to customers and collaborators  including the entirety of costs incurred in connection with programs that have been partnered and on which we receive research funding 
at times  we may dedicate additional resources and incur costs in addition to costs covered by research funding received in such collaborative programs 
revenue 
our business strategy is focused on turning our discoveries into new drugs for the treatment of common diseases 
at the same time  we leverage our capabilities to generate revenue through corporate alliances and through service contracts 
in the majority of our programs we are pursuing drug development on our own 
in certain others  we have formed alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms through which we can cover some of the cost of conducting basic research and spread the risk and investment involved in product development 
we have entered into research  development  commercialization  and fee for service alliances and contracts across our business 
depending on the nature of each prospective business opportunity  the key components of the commercial terms of such arrangements typically include one or more of the following research funding  up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees  fees for particular services  milestone payments  license or commercialization fees  and royalties or profit sharing from the commercialization of products 
significant elements of our revenue is summarized as follows for the year ended december  in thousands research funding and service fees    milestone payments    up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees other   collaborations with our most significant partners include f 
hoffmann la roche roche 
therapeutics 
in we entered into a research collaboration and cross license agreement with roche  under which we identified key genetic factors involved in ten common diseases osteoarthritis  alzheimer s disease  schizophrenia  paod  stroke  osteoporosis  obesity  anxiety  non insulin dependent diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis 
in january  we entered into a new three year agreement with roche focused on turning the achievements of our gene discovery collaboration into novel therapeutics 
the agreement provided that we would collaborate with respect to four diseases that had been the subject of the agreement 
during we collaborated with roche on two of those diseases 
under the agreement  which expired on february   we received million in research funding and we are entitled to receive royalties on the sales of any drugs that are developed coming out of work conducted under this agreement 
in november  we signed a new three year agreement with roche to co develop inhibitors of pde for the prevention and treatment of vascular disease  including stroke 
this agreement continues work advanced under the agreement  and we will focus on optimizing lead compounds identified under the previous agreement and beginning clinical development 
we and roche will share drug discovery and clinical trials costs under this new agreement  and we may receive milestone payments and royalties based on drug sales 
diagnostics 
in june  we signed a five year alliance with roche s diagnostics division to develop and market dna based diagnostics for major diseases 
more recently we have added research programs aimed at developing diagnostics to predict drug response for major therapeutics used to treat those diseases  in order to help select the most effective treatment of those available 
under the agreement we have received  in research funding  up front fees and milestone payments 
we may receive  in additional research funding over the remainder of the term of the agreement as well as milestone payments upon the achievement of research and development milestones and royalties on the sales of diagnostic products developed 
revenues from these alliances with roche amounted to million million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs incurred in connection with these collaborative programs with roche amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
costs incurred in connection with these collaborative programs for are not available as these costs were not historically tracked by program prior to merck co  inc merck 
obesity 
in september  we entered into an alliance with merck aimed at developing new treatments for obesity 
under the alliance  we are combining our research efforts in the genetics of obesity to identify  validate and prioritize a series of drug targets to take into development 
under the terms of the three year agreement  which can be extended on a year to year basis upon the consent of the parties  we have received research funding  technology access fees and milestone payments in the aggregate amount of  and may receive research funding and technology access in the future of  in addition  we may receive further research milestone payments and we may receive milestone payments as compounds developed under the alliance advance in the development process and royalties on successfully marketed drugs 
merck may terminate the agreement at any time upon days notice in the event that the research program fails to achieve certain specified goals 
as of the end of  we had discovered three genes lined to obesity under this alliance  and merck had generated lead series of compounds against one of the targets we have validated through our genetics research 
revenues from this alliance with merck amounted to million million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs incurred in connection with this alliance with merck amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
costs incurred in connection with these collaborative programs for are not available as these costs were not historically tracked by program prior to information rich clinical trials 
in february  we entered into an agreement with merck which provides that we will conduct information rich clinical trials on a range of merck s developmental compounds that merck selects for inclusion in the program 
the term of the alliance is seven years  subject to termination by merck after five years 
under the terms of the agreement  we will receive royalties on sales of drugs and diagnostics developed as part of the alliance 
the collaboration involved three agreements a a license and research collaboration agreement  b a stock and warrant purchase agreement  and c a warrant agreement 
under the terms of the license and research collaboration agreement  decode will receive royalties on sales of drugs and diagnostics developed as part of the alliance  will receive milestone payments as compounds or pharmacogenomic tests reach the market  will receive research funding for the clinical development of compounds and pharmacogenomic analysis  and received a one time technology access fee of million 
there is a contingency clause on the technology access fee provides that if we reject the first two non exclusive development compounds that merck presents to the collaboration  then merck has the right to request a refund of million of the technology access fee 
the remaining amount of the technology access fee is non refundable 
to date  merck has not selected any compounds for development under the agreement 
under the terms of the stock and warrant purchase agreement  merck purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share or million  which represents a premium of million to the fair market value of the stock on the effective date of the agreements per share 
accordingly  of the million cash received  we have ascribed million to the common stock and million to deferred revenue 
under the terms of the warrant agreement  we have issued merck a warrant to purchase up to  of additional shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share over the five year term of the warrant 
the warrant is exercisable at merck s option as to  shares for a period of days commencing on the first  second  third  fourth and fifth anniversaries of the warrant agreement with the final portion of warrants expiring in march any portion of this warrant that is not exercised during an applicable exercise period shall expire and be of no further force or effect 
the warrant was valued at million using a black scholes model with the following assumptions lives of one to five years  risk free interest rates of to  volatility of and no dividend yield 
the one time technology access fee of million and the million premium received on the sale of common stock less the estimated fair value of the warrant of million  together netting to million  has been deferred and the million net amount was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue according to level of efforts over the seven year development term 
revenues and costs incurred in connection with this alliance with merck amounted to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid 
in september  we were awarded a five year million contract by the niaid  part of the us national institutes of health 
under the contract  we will apply our population approach and resources to discover genetic factors associated with susceptibility to certain infectious diseases and with responsiveness to vaccines targeting such diseases 
the university of new mexico will be working with us to conduct functional validation of biological pathways discovered through our genetic research 
the national center for genome resources will provide bioinformatics resources to make study information and results available to the scientific community 
we expect that we will expend funds generally ratably over the five year term of the contract beginning with applied biosystems group abg 
in the fourth quarter of  we terminated and entered into a related settlement agreement regarding two agreements with abg that had been in place since july our accounting policy for the joint development and commercialization agreement with abg to develop genotypic analysis products provided for revenue related to abg s payment obligation and our development costs associated with the agreement to be deferred until the development efforts were completed or the agreement is terminated  if earlier  as was the case 
as a result  deferred revenue of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of when the parties reached agreement as to termination 
revenue for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except revenue      the decrease in revenue in is reflective of the gradual transition of our business from the generation of near term revenue through service partnerships to a focus on the development of new drugs in major indications  as well as the varability in the amount and timing of milestone and other payments related to our product development alliances 
the increase in revenue in from is largely accountable to there being a full year of research funding payments and amortization of technology access and exclusivity fees in our collaboration with merck and from milestone payments received in our collaborations with roche and with merck  partially offset by the termination of the abg collaboration in the fourth quarter of at the close of the year we had million in deferred revenue  compared to million at the close of the this increase reflects cash received related to the alliance with merck  which will be recognized  along with other deferred revenue  over future reporting periods 
we expect that our revenues will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial especially because progress in our scientific work  including milestone payments that are related to progress  can fluctuate between quarters 
cost of revenue  including collaborative programs 
cost of revenue  including costs incurred in connection with collaborative programs for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except cost of revenue  including collaborative programs   the decreases in our cost of revenue  including costs incurred in connection with collaborative programs generally reflect the streamlining and automation of our core genetics research and other operations 
our cost of revenue consists of the costs of services provided to customers and collaborators  including the entirety of costs incurred in connection with programs that have been partnered and on which we receive research funding 
at times  we may invest in addition to costs covered by research funding received in such collaborative programs

the relative strengthening of the icelandic krona versus the us dollar over the periods presented has appreciably affected the us dollar reported amounts of our expenses denominated in icelandic krona eg  an increase of approximately million on a portion of our salary and employee related expenses and may continue to do so 
our cost of revenue  including costs incurred in connection with collaborative programs  reflects spending related to the range of our disease gene research programs together with the impact of the measures we implemented late in  taking advantage of investments in automation in our disease gene research programs 
the decrease in as compared to is principally attributable to i increased salaries and employee related expenses million  driving ii increased allocation of depreciation and amortization million  together with iii less in chemicals and consumables used million  and iv lower costs of contractor services million 
research and development proprietary programs 
research and development for proprietary programs for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except research and development proprietary programs   the changes our research and development expenses in proprietary programs over the years presented reflect the streamlining and automation of the our core genetics research operations but also our emphasis on and increasing expenditures in product development clinical work and pre clinical preparations on our lead development programs 
importantly  during we conducted and completed our phase iia clinical trial of dg  which is being developed for the prevention of heart attack 
based on the results of this trial  which we announced in october  we are designing an information rich  multicenter phase iii trial to test dg for the prevention of heart attack 
during we have also incurred costs in preparing for planned upcoming clinical studies of dgo our research and development costs for proprietary programs in as compared to include i an increase of million in salaries and related costs largely related to costs associated with our phase iia trial of dg and preclinical work for dg ii million related to increased usage of other chemicals and consumables mainly in our genotyping facility  both factors driving iii increased allocation of depreciation and amortization million  together with iv million more of outside services mostly on account of our dg program  offset somewhat by v a relative net benefit of million resulting from chemicals and consumables we used for which there was relatively little or no attendant cost as a result of prior provisions we had made as slow moving  excess or obsolete according to our accounting policy 
our research and development expenses for also reflect net benefit of million resulting from a reversal of accrued database license fees in that year 
experienced increases in the research and developments costs of our proprietary programs eg  salaries and attendant costs  usage of chemicals and consumables will likely continue  particularly as we advance our clinical development and proprietary drug development programs 
further  the relative strengthening of the icelandic krona versus the us dollar over the periods presented has appreciably affected the us dollar reported amounts of our expenses denominated in icelandic krona eg  an increase of approximately million on a portion of our salary and employee related expenses and may continue to do so 
our research and development for proprietary programs reflects spending related to the range of our disease gene research programs  including product development and downstream work on targets already identified 
the significant decreases in as compared to stem from the cost reduction measures we implemented late in  taking advantage of investments in automation in our disease gene research programs and with notable reductions in i our usage of chemicals and consumables million  ii salary and related expenses million  iii depreciation and amortization  iv costs related to our clinical collaborations million  and v our research and development property related and other overheads million 
our research and development expenses for as compared to also reflect a relative net benefit of million resulting from a reversal of accrued database license fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except selling  general and administrative    our selling  general and administrative expenses for have increased  notably including i increased salaries and employee related costs m  ii employee incentives million  iii severance costs million  iv greater travel and overhead expenses m  v recruiting fees related to the addition of new members to our board of directors and also our efforts to hire necessary clinical development and regulatory staff million  vi an accrual for probable losses related to grant monies received in pre acquisition periods of medichem million  together with vii lower stock based compensation million 
the decrease in as compared to reflects the impact of the cost reduction programs implemented in late  with notable reductions in our legal and other third party service costs million and in our travel and other overhead expenses million  more than making up for increases in our outside auditing expenses million and in our director s and officer s insurance premiums million 
several of the above noted items are likely irregular in their occurrence 
other of the experienced increases in our selling  general and administrative expenses may likely continue 
in particular  we have granted salary increases and bonuses in and are actively seeking to add critical staff 
further the relative strengthening of the icelandic krona versus the us dollar over the periods presented has appreciably affected the us dollar reported amounts of our general and administrative expenses denominated in icelandic krona eg  an increase of approximately million on a portion of our salary and employee related expenses and may continue to do so 
stock based compensation and remuneration expense 
stock based compensation and remuneration expense for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except stock based compensation and remuneration expense   with little compensation expense being attributed to our more recent stock option grants  stock based compensation and remuneration expense has been decreasing as grants made to employees in earlier years become fully vested 
historical stock based compensation and remuneration is not necessarily representative of the effects on reported income or loss for future years due to  among other things  the vesting period of the stock options  the value of stock options that have been granted in recent times and the required change to the fair value method 
fasb no 
r replaces fasb statement no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
and eliminates the ability to account for employee share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method 
fasb no 
r requires such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method that would result in additional expense being recognized in our financial statements 
we will be required to adopt fasb no 
r in the third quarter of and  although we have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial position or results of operations  the charges involved could be significant 
impairment  employee termination benefits and other costs 
impairment  employee termination benefits and other costs for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except impairment  employee termination benefits and other costs in september  we implemented a cost reduction program and  in this regard  we reduced total worldwide headcount  focusing in particular on utilizing ongoing process automation and increased productivity in the core genetics operations in reykjavik 
stemming from this initiative and together with our consideration of significant and pervasive declines in the market environment for pharmaceutical and biotech industries  we determined that impairment tests of the carrying value of our goodwill and other long lived assets  including the long lived assets acquired through the medichem acquisition  should be performed and  as a result  we recorded impairment  employee termination benefits and other charges amounting to million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded  of additional employee terminations benefits related to employees 
there were no benefits obligations remaining as of december  interest income 
interest income for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except interest income      our interest income has increased mainly as a result of the completion of the offering of senior convertible notes in april  realizing net proceeds of million 
we expect to use the proceeds of this offering principally for advancing our drug and clinical development programs 
in the meantime  we will invest the monies received in accordance with our policy  having the objective of preserving principal while maximizing income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we expect to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including auction rate securities  commercial paper  money market funds  mutual fund investments and government and non government debt securities interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except interest expense     the increase in our interest expense principally reflect interest on our senior convertible notes due that we issued in april we began making the necessary semi annual interest payments on the senior convertible notes in october as a result of the senior convertible notes  our interest expense has increased million on an annualized basis 
other non operating income and expense  net 
other non operating income and expense for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except other non operating income and expense  net   our other non operating income and expense  net consists principally of the net impact of foreign exchange and unrealized and realized swap gains and losses 
as a consequence of the nature our business and operations our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
the net impact of foreign exchange on the translated amount of our non us dollar denominated liabilities  net together with transaction gains and losses  amounted to losses of million  million and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the continued weakening of the us dollar compared to the icelandic krona during has been significant and these currency fluctuations may continue to adversely affect our financial results 
our swap gains and losses stem from the two cross currency swaps we entered into as economic hedges against foreign exchange rate fluctuations that may have occurred on our foreign currency debt but that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
our other non operating income and expense  net includes unrealized swap gains of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in march  we liquidated our two cross currency swaps receiving million in proceeds 
we realized a loss on this early termination that  together with unrealized losses on the swaps during the year ended december   amounted to a million loss 
income taxes 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and did not owe any icelandic or us federal income taxes nor did we pay any in the years ended december   or realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any 
as of december   we had net operating losses able to be carried forward for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million to offset future taxable income in the united states that expire at various dates through also  as of december  our foreign subsidiaries had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that expire in varying amounts beginning in net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share 
net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except net loss      basic and diluted net loss per share net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share both increased in the year ended december  principally on account of higher research and development related to the advancement of our drug development programs  lower revenues  higher interest expense related to our convertible notes issued in april and the impact  both realized and unrealized  of foreign exchange fluctuations 
decreases as compared to the year ended december  principally related to the impact of significant impairment  employee termination costs and other gains and other costs recorded in that year 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through funding from research and development collaborative agreements  and the issuance of equity securities and long term financing instruments million from the beginning of to date 
future funding under terms of our existing agreements is approximately million excluding milestone payments and royalties that we may earn under such collaborations 
although we depend upon funded research arrangements for a significant portion of our revenue  we continue to invest in proprietary research and development and we will incur the costs of such activities 
in the near term  this will require us to continue to devote resources to in our in house drug and clinical development which we believe will better position us to capture the most value to us in our discoveries 
as we identify promising discoveries for further development  we may choose to continue the development ourselves into and through clinical trials  regulatory clearances and manufacture  distribution and marketing 
in other cases we are or will be working to varying degrees with partners 
the decisions we make as to these matters will affect our cash requirements 
based upon the range of our current activities  we expect to have greater overall net use of cash in in our operating  investing and financing activities than we did in our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including the level and timing of our research and development expenditures  our ability access the capital markets  to obtain new research and development collaboration agreements  to obtain and maintain contract service agreements in our pharmaceuticals  biostructures  clinical research trials and genotyping service groups  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the purchase of additional capital equipment  and capital expenditures at our facilities 
changes in our research and development plans  notably the entry into clinical trials of drugs based on our discoveries  or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash to fund our operations for several years 
however  under all circumstances  we will require significant additional capital in the future  which we may seek to raise through further public or private equity offerings  additional debt financing or added collaborations and licensing arrangements 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing or collaborations and licensing arrangements will be available when needed  or that if available  will be obtained on favorable terms 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we may have to curtail operations or attempt to raise funds on unattractive terms 
for the year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities   financing activities   cash and cash equivalents  at end of period    cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
together with our restricted cash and resources put into investments at december  million  this balance is approximately million more than at the close of the increase reflects net proceeds from our convertible notes issue completed in april million  equity and technology access fee payments received related to the signing of a new drug development alliance with merck million and the liquidation of our two currency swaps million offset with capital expenditures million  debt service million and costs associated with the advancement of our drug development programs as reflected in the million of cash we used in operating activities during available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity and safety of principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our cash is deposited only with financial institutions in iceland  the united kingdom and the united states having a high credit standing a a or better 
we expect to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including auction rate securities commercial paper  money market funds  mutual fund investments and government and non government debt securities 
at december   our cash is largely invested in us dollar denominated money market and checking accounts and also in icelandic krona denominated accounts 
at december   our investments are in auction rate securities  corporate bonds  mutual funds and a certificate of deposit with a remaining maturity of one month 
operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  because of the million of the monies received by us in the information rich clinical trial alliance with merck  in working capital provided million of funds as compared to a use million in as more fully described above  the increase in use of cash in operating activities primarily derives from research and development investments being made in advancing our drug and clinical development programs 
working capital needs resulted in the net use of million of funds in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  on account of this and significant non cash impairment and other charges in  although net loss decreased million in as compared to  net cash used in operating activities decreased million 
as more fully described above  this was as a result of our increased revenue base and the impacts of the cost reduction measures we implemented late in notably  in we made significant payments to our vendors and particularly to abg for reagents  other supplies and dna analyzers 
in addition  into we were continuing to make significant investments in our disease gene research programs and had taken on the costs of downstream work on targets already identified as well as were expanding our sales efforts across our businesses 
investing activities 
our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures and long term strategic equity investments in  and acquisitions of  technologies and businesses that are complementary to our business 
we principally made replacement capital expenditures during the years ended december  and and did invest in certain equipment for our statistical and other laboratories during although we expect we will continue to make principally replacement capital expenditures in the near term  net cash used in investing activities may in the future fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of our capital expenditures and other investments as well as changing business needs 
purchases of property and equipment during the year ended december  were million as compared to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  the purchases being primarily due to the expansion of our facilities and operations 
we principally made replacement capital expenditures during and investments during the year ended december  consist mainly of auction rate securities  corporate bonds  mutual funds and certificates of deposit with maturities of up to seven months 
financing activities 
net cash of million was provided in financing activities in the year ended december  as compared to million and million provided in financing activities in the years ended december  and  respectively 
financing activities for the year ended december  largely consisted of the net proceeds from our convertible notes issue completed in april million  the refinancing of our tier c bonds and tier d bank loan  equity proceeds and a portion of the up front monies received by us in the information rich clinical trial alliance with merck million  proceeds in the liquidation of our two cross currency swap million and installment payments on our existing debt and capital lease obligations million 
financing activities for the year ended december  largely consisted of the sale and month leaseback of certain laboratory equipment million which was extended in january for another months  with the final payment due in june  short term borrowings million and installment payments on our debt and capital lease obligations million 
in the year  we repaid the borrowings under a bridge loan with the proceeds from our tier a million bond offering  tier c million offering of privately placed bonds and tier d million bank loan  we repaid the existing mortgage on our woodridge  il discovery center million and re financed the property  resulting in proceeds of million  and we made installment payments on our debt and capital lease obligations million 
in april  we completed an offering of senior convertible notes due to qualified institutional buyers 
in addition to the million principal amount of notes offered  we issued a further million of notes pursuant to the exercise of the over allotment option by the initial purchasers of the notes 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock  at the option of the holder  at a price of per share  equivalent to an initial conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of the notes 
we may redeem the notes beginning april  we expect to use the proceeds of the offering principally for advancing our drug development programs  as well as for general corporate purposes 
in march  we entered into a  term loan with an icelandic financial institution the lender to refinance our tier c bonds and tier d bank loan  thereby securing a significantly lower interest rate and extended payment terms on this portion of our mortgage obligations 
the new term loan bears interest at the three month libor plus as of december  until march   at which point  the lender may adjust the interest margin unilaterally 
the term loan is payable in twenty quarterly payments starting on march  and the final payment is due on december  the term loan can be repaid on every anniversary of the loan starting on march   but for which we will pay a prepayment fee of for every year that remains on the term loan facility with a maximum fee of 
contractual commitments 
our major outstanding contractual commitments relate to the privately placed bonds and bank loans and equipment lease financings 
our contractual commitments as of december  were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands senior convertible notes  including interest   long term debt      capital lease obligations  including interest    operating leases  under the terms of certain technology licensing agreements  decode is obligated to make payments upon the achievement of established milestones leading to the discovery of defined products 
these payments could total  and the year incurred cannot be determined at the current time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs  and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made primarily in high grade corporate bonds  asset backed debt securities and us government agency debt securities 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the company s convertible notes  because they bear interest at a fixed rate 
the market value of the convertible notes was million on december  as a consequence of the nature our business and operations our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
we continue to monitor our exposure to currency risk 
a hypothetical decrease in value of the us dollar against the icelandic krona would result in a loss of approximately million on our icelandic krona denominated non us dollar assets and liabilities 
we have historically purchased instruments to hedge these general risks through the use of derivative financial instruments  however  we have no derivative instruments outstanding as of december  as of december  we did not have any financing arrangements that were not reflected in our balance sheet
