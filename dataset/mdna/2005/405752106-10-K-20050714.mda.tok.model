item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a nationwide  high availability  multi vendor enterprise maintenance service and solutions provider for enterprises  including business  global services providers  governmental agencies and other organizations 
we have undertaken significant changes to our business in recent years 
after selling the operational outsourcing division in  we began the shift of our business to a predominantly services model 
in september  we completed the acquisition of alphanational technology services  inc and in august  we completed the acquisition of microserv  inc these acquisitions significantly expanded our geographic base  strengthened our nationwide service delivery capabilities  bolstered management depth  and added several prestigious customers 
on june   we sold our secure network services business 
we undertook this sale to leverage the valuations in federal government properties and to enable us to focus our resources and management on our core business of high availability maintenance services 
the proceeds from this transaction will be used to repay approximatley million of outstanding indebtedness and provide working capital 
the sale of the secure network services business has significantly improved our balance sheet 
see sale of secure network services business for more information 
we offer a growing list of services to businesses  global service providers  governmental agencies and other organizations 
our services are customized to meet each customer s needs providing xx service  personnel with required security clearances for certain governmental programs  project management services  depot repair and roll out services 
we believe the flexible services we offer to our customers enable us to tailor a solution to obtain maximum efficiencies within their budgeting constraints 
on september   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of alphanational in a merger transaction  for total consideration of approximately million  excluding the contingent earn out payment described below 
we acquired alphanational to increase our geographic coverage  expand the depth of management and increase the breadth of our product serviceability 
alphanational is an enterprise maintenance solutions company providing services to a national market place 
the merger consideration was comprised of cash in an amount equal to thousand and notes in principal amount of thousand with an interest rate of per annum with a term of months  liabilities assumed of approximately thousand   shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of million based upon a price of and fees and other related costs of approximately thousand 
the quoted closing price of was discounted because as such shares which were not registered under the securities act of  as amended  and are subject to transfer restrictions 
the notes were adjusted from an aggregate value of thousand to thousand based upon the adjusted closing balance sheet of alphanational 
in addition  the agreement included a contingent earn out payment pursuant to which an additional  in cash or our common stock at the discretion of certain former alphanational shareholders 
the earn out is payable if certain agreed upon financial targets are met through september  at march   we recorded a deferred tax asset of million 
based upon our historical taxable income as a result of the gain on the sale of our secure network services business and estimates of future profitability  management concluded that future income will more than likely be sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets 
the recording of this tax benefit had a significant positive effect on the results of operations and balance sheet 
in august  we completed the acquisition of microserv  inc  which significantly expanded our geographic base in the western part of the us 
in july  we completed a private placement of common stock and warrants in the aggregate amount of million  to strengthen our financial position 
primarily as a result of the costs incurred related to the start up of a new long term nation wide enterprise maintenance contract  we incurred an operating loss for year ended march  after the successful implementation of the initial phase  the remaining roll out schedule was accelerated 
the cost of the accelerated roll out of service and certain unanticipated service delivery costs exceeded our estimates when pricing the contract 
these costs were comprised of procurement and consumption of inventory  freight costs to stage the inventory where strategically necessary  increases in overtime and higher than anticipated usage of subcontractors 
we also experienced higher than anticipated failure rates on certain pieces of equipment  which contributed to the poor financial performance of this contract and operating results for the year ended march  we have undertaken several cost containment measurements and modifications designed to minimize the potential for future loss on this contract on a going forward basis 
in addition  we negotiated a favorable adjustment to the contract effective january  though may  services revenues included monthly recurring fixed unit price contracts as well as time and material contracts 
revenues related to the fixed price service agreements are recognized ratably over the lives of the agreements 
amounts billed in advance of the services period are recorded as unearned revenues and recognized when earned 
losses on contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which the losses become determinable 
when we are awarded a contract to provide services  we may incur expenses before we receive any contract payments 
this may result in a cash short fall that may impact our working capital and financing 
this may also cause fluctuations in operating results as start up costs are expensed as incurred 
see business risk factors we incur significant costs in connection with the start up of new contracts before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls and fluctuations in quarterly results from period to period 
the revenues and related expenses associated with product sales are recognized when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer 
our goal is to return to maintain profitable operations  expand our customer base of clients through our existing global service provider partners  seek new global service provider partners  and enhance the technology we utilize to deliver cost effective services to our growing customer base 
our ability to increase profitability will be impacted by our ability to continue to compete within the industry  and our ability to replace contracts which were sold in connection with the sale of the secure network services business 
we must also effectively manage expenses in relation to revenues by directing new business development towards markets that complement or improve our existing service lines 
we must continue to emphasize operating efficiencies through cost containment strategies  re engineering efforts and improved service delivery techniques  particularly within costs of services  selling  marketing and general and administrative expenses 
our future operating results may be affected by a number of factors including uncertainties relative to national economic conditions and terrorism  especially as they affect interest rates  the reduction in revenue as a result of the sale of our secure network services business  industry factors and our ability to successfully increase our sales of services  accurately estimate costs when bidding on a contract  and effectively manage expenses 
we have streamlined our service delivery process  expanded our depot repair facility to repair rather than purchase new component parts and are working with our customers to modify the processes under which services are rendered to our customers 
we plan to effectively manage expenses in relation to revenues by directing new business development towards markets that complement or improve our existing service lines 
management must also continue to emphasize operating efficiencies through cost containment strategies  reengineering efforts and improved service delivery techniques 
the industry in which we operate has experienced unfavorable economic conditions and competitive challenges 
our operating results reflect the impact of this challenging environment 
we continue to see significant price competition and customer demand for higher service attainment levels 
in addition  there is significant price competition in the market for state and local government contracts as a result of budget issues  political pressure and other factors beyond our control 
as experienced with the loss of our contract with the commonwealth of pennsylvania in early fiscal year  longevity and quality of service may have little influence in the customer decision making process 
consolidated results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended march   and and financial condition as of march  and we operate as a single business segment  whereby we provide high availability maintenance services  and technology deployment and integration for commercial and governmental clients 
prior to june  we provided secure network services for government clients 
the results of operations do not take into account the sale of our secure network services business on june  years ended march  amounts in thousands except share data results of operations change change revenues costs of services percent of revenues gross margin percent of revenues selling percent of revenues marketing percent of revenues general and administrative percent of revenues abandonment of lease total operating expenses n m percent of revenues operating loss income percent of revenues interest expense other income n m income before taxes income tax benefit expense  n m net loss income loss earnings per share basic loss earnings per share diluted n m not meaningful revenues revenues are generated from the sale of high availability enterprise maintenance services  technology deployment and secure network services consisting of professional services  seat management and deployment services  and product sales and secure network services 
services revenues include monthly recurring fixed unit price contracts as well as time and material contracts 
amounts billed in advance of the services period are recorded as unearned revenues and recognized when earned 
the revenues and related expenses associated with product held for resale are recognized when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer 
the components of revenues are as follows amounts in thousands march  revenues services product held for resale total revenues revenues increased  or million  during fiscal year  compared to fiscal year during fiscal year we experienced growth in our high availability maintenance services as a result of the start up of several new contracts  which was partially offset by decreased product sales 
included in fiscal year was the alphanational acquisition which was completed on september  in addition  we experienced significant growth in our secure network services offering as a result of continued demand from homeland security 
product held for resale decreased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decrease was a result of intense competition in the product marketplace  a declining rate of orders and lower margins 
we have de emphasized product sales and intend to focus primarily on our recurring services revenue model for enterprise maintenance solutions 
for fiscal year revenues decreased  or thousand  compared to fiscal year during fiscal year  we experienced an increase in our high availability maintenance services and technology deployment activities  however this was offset by a decrease in our secure network services offering 
the decline in secure network services was a result of non recurring services in that did not materialize in product held for resale also increased by thousand during fiscal year to million compared to million in the alphanational and microserv acquisitions completed in september and august added several marquee accounts to our enterprise maintenance services 
however  these gains were negatively affected by pricing concessions and certain lost contracts 
in fiscal year  we expect our services revenues to decrease as a result of the sale of our secure network services business and continued reductions in our product sales revenues due to on going price competition 
we expect the product trends to continue downward with many of the new products being offered at lower prices and with significantly lower margins 
revenues for the secured network services business were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectfully 
as result of the sale of this business on june   these revenues will not be recurring 
cost of services included within cost of services are direct costs  including fringe benefits  product and part costs  and other costs 
a large part of our service costs are support costs and expenses that include direct labor and infrastructure costs to support our service offerings 
as we continue to expand our service offerings  we anticipate that the direct costs to support these service offerings will continue to increase in fiscal year on long term fixed unit price contracts  part costs vary depending upon the call volume received from customers during the period 
many of these costs are volume driven and as volumes increase  these costs as a percentage of revenues increase  generating a negative impact to profit margins 
the variable component of these costs are product and part costs  overtime  subcontracted work and freight 
product is broken into two categories parts and equipment to support our service base and product held for resale 
part costs are highly variable and are dependent on several factors 
on long term fixed unit price contracts  parts and peripherals are consumed on service calls 
for installation services and seat management services  product may consist of hardware  software  cabling and other materials that are components of the service performed 
product held for resale consists of hardware and software 
cost of services consists of the following components amounts in thousands march  services delivery and support product held for resale total direct costs indirect costs costs of services during fiscal year  our cost of services  delivery and support increased million to million from million in fiscal year this increase was partially due to an increase in salaries  overtime  and subcontracted services 
also  as a result of the startup of a new long term  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract  we incurred an operating loss 
after the successful implementation of the initial phase  the remaining roll out schedule was accelerated 
the costs associated with the accelerated roll out and certain unanticipated delivery costs were comprised of inventory  freight  costs to stage the inventory where strategically necessary  increased overtime and higher than anticipated usage of sub contractors that exceeded our estimates 
many of these costs were one time in nature  such as freight costs incurred to stage inventory  initial parts cost and non recoverable labor incurred in hiring and training staff 
historically  other increased costs are initially incurred at the start of a new contract that are difficult to measure  such as increased repair times due to becoming familiar with new product sets and higher call volumes which are inherent when one switches service providers 
we also experienced higher than anticipated failure rates on certain pieces of equipment  which contributed to the poor performance on this contract and operating results for the fiscal year 
during fiscal year  our cost of services delivery and support decreased by million from million during to million 
the decrease in the cost of services delivery and support was primarily related to reduced costs associated with the non recurring revenues in our secured network services in additional cost reductions were achieved through the integration of microserv and continued cost containment efforts 
during fiscal year and  we continued to see erosion in gross margins on product held for resale due to the competitively priced product market 
during fiscal year  the costs of product held for resale decreased to million from million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of reduced revenues 
the cost of product held for resale increased thousand to million due to increased revenue compared to fiscal year the gross margin on product held for resale was thousand  or in fiscal year compared to thousand  or in fiscal year  and thousand or in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year  total direct costs for fiscal year increased by approximately million  or  to million 
as discussed above  the increase in direct costs was due to increases in salaries and overtime costs related to the start up of a new long term  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract 
total direct cost during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year decreased million  or  from to as result of the decrease in services delivery and support offset by the increases in costs related to product held for resale 
indirect costs include costs related to operating our call center  logistics  dispatch operations  facility costs and other costs incurred to support the field service technicians and engineers 
during fiscal year  indirect costs increased by million  or from million in fiscal year to million 
the primary reason for the increase in indirect costs was increases in our allowance for inventory obsolescence and the integration of alphanational with its related occupancy and back office costs 
indirect costs increased thousand from million in fiscal year to million for fiscal year  a increase 
the increase in indirect costs was attributable to several factors the integration of microserv with associated payroll and occupancy costs  and increases in travel  telecommunications and business insurance 
in addition  we experienced a significant increase in recruiting fees as we increased personnel with required security clearances by in our secured networks services business 
costs related to our secure network services business were million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
gross margin fiscal year gross margin was negatively affected by the increase in costs discussed above 
our fiscal year gross margin reflected the economic and competitive challenges we faced 
as a percent of revenues  the gross margin percent was for fiscal year  and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the reduction in gross margins in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was the result of initial start up costs associated with the commencement of a new long term  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract  higher delivery costs on new business  increases in our allowance for inventory obsolescence and continued industry wide pricing pressures 
gross margins decreased thousand  or  from fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of reduced revenues discussed above 
we must continue to increase revenues  continue in our cost reduction efforts and deploy technology to gain operating efficiencies in order to remain competitive 
we expect that the continued shift from product sales towards long term service contracts will have a positive effect on our gross margins over the long term  and for such margins to improve as we must continue to increase our enterprise maintenance solutions base 
gross margin for our secure network services business was million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
selling expenses selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel costs and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales 
selling expenses increased thousand or from million to million in fiscal year  primarily related to increased commissions as a result of increases in new business and increased travel and personnel costs 
for fiscal year  selling expense increased thousand to million from million in the prior year  which was an increase of 
the primary reasons for the increase in selling expense was increased commissions related to new business and increased travel 
marketing expense during fiscal year  marketing expense decreased from thousand to thousand  a decrease of 
the decrease in marketing expense was the result of decreased promotional efforts in fiscal year marketing expense decreased from thousand in fiscal year to thousand in fiscal year  an decrease  was the result of various cost containment actions and curtailment of marketing programs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of non allocated overhead costs 
these costs include executive  accounting  contract administration  professional services  such as legal and audit  business insurance  occupancy and other costs 
during fiscal year  general and administrative expenses increased thousand  from million to million  or 
the increase in general and administrative expense was the result of several factors  which include increases in payroll and fringe benefits  outside services  principally legal  audit and professional fees  increases in occupancy costs related to the acquisition of alphanational  telecommunications expense  and depreciation expenses as a result of improvements made to our it infrastructure 
general and administrative expense decreased thousand  or  in fiscal year compared to this decrease was a result of cost control efforts  including employment actions such as postponing salary increases  and in certain cases  reducing wage rates for administrative staff 
in spite of vigorous cost containment efforts  various factors  such as changes in insurance markets  related costs associated with complying with new securities and exchange commission regulations and the american stock exchange requirements may increase general and administrative expenses which will have a negative impact on our earnings in fiscal year and future periods 
abandonment of facility in conjunction with the acquisition of alphanational we conducted a review of our facility requirement and determined that after the completion of the acquisition we would have excess space 
during september  we recorded a charge for abandonment of facility of approximately thousand related to the sub leasing of rental office space 
we leased the excess space effective october  the abandonment charge is net of minimum sub lease rents of approximately thousand 
operating loss income we incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal year compared to operating income of million in fiscal year the loss in fiscal year was primarily due to the loss incurred on the new long term  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract previously discussed  increases in our allowance for inventory obsolescence and the abandonment of certain office space 
operating income was million for fiscal year compared to million in  a decrease of or thousand 
the economy and competitive challenges were the primary reasons for the decrease in operating income for fiscal year interest expense during fiscal year  interest expense increased from thousand in fiscal year to thousand  due to increased borrowings 
interest expense decreased from thousand to thousand during fiscal year due to slightly lower monthly borrowing activities compared to fiscal year and lower interest rates 
income taxes for fiscal year  we recorded a tax benefit of thousand  and for fiscal year  we recorded a non recurring income tax benefit of million 
we believe that it is appropriate to record the deferred tax asset based upon our estimates of future profitability  and the gain on the sale of our secure network services business completed on june  the tax benefit consists of the realization of the tax benefits for timing differences for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
the components of the tax benefit are primarily the net operating loss carryforward  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence reserves and depreciation and amortization expense 
for fiscal year  we recorded income tax expense of  principally for minimum state and local obligations 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains an analysis of our deferred tax assets 
net loss income for fiscal year  we recorded a net loss of million compared to net income for fiscal year of million 
the net loss per share was 
basic and diluted compared to and basic and diluted for fiscal year ended march  as discussed above  the primary reasons for the loss was the costs incurred on the new long term  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract  increases in our allowance for inventory obsolescence  and the abandonment of certain office space 
as a result of income from operations of thousand and the non recurring income tax benefit of million  net income increased from thousand in fiscal year to million in fiscal year earnings per share were  basic  and  diluted for the year ended march  compared to  basic and diluted  for the fiscal year depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million  thousand and thousand for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
during fiscal year  depreciation and amortization increased thousand of which thousand and thousand was the amortization of intangible assets as a result of the microserv and alphanational acquisitions  respectively and thousand was increased depreciation as a result of upgrading our information systems and technology 
in we will continue our investment in technology which is expected to increase our operating efficiency 
we continue to focus the majority of our capital spending on technology enhancements that will increase operating efficiencies 
sale of secure network services business on june   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with indus corporation pursuant to which we sold substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our secure network services business 
the purchase price was approximately million  subject to adjustments described in the asset purchase agreement based on the net assets of the business on the date of closing 
the asset purchase agreement provides that million of the purchase price be held in escrow 
of this amount   is held as security for the payment of our indemnification obligations pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  if any  and will be released to us eighteen months following the date of the asset purchase agreement unless a certain key government contract  referred to as the key contract  is not assigned referred to as a novation as of such time 
a portion of the escrow amount equal to million which includes the portion referenced above for indemnification obligations  plus any interest or other income earned thereon  will also serve as security for a payment obligation we have to indus corporation if the novation of the key contract from us to indus corporation is not approved by such government customer and received within two years from the date of the asset purchase agreement

impact on earnings for the elimination of earnings for the secure network services business liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had approximately million of cash on hand 
sources of our cash in fiscal have been from cash generated from operations and our revolving credit facility  as described below 
after the sale of the secure network services business  on june   we had approximately million cash on hand 
we are continuing to focus on our core high availability maintenance services business while at the same time evaluating our future strategic direction 
as part of our business strategy  we intend on reducing our indebtedness 
with a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of the secure network services business  we are repaying approximately million of our indebtedness including million repayment of our revolving credit agreement   principal amount of our convertible subordinated debentures  principal amount of our promissory notes dated october   principal amount of our promissory notes dated october   accrued interest on our convertible subordinated debentures  and promissory notes dated october   october   november  and november    principal amount on our notes issued to former microserv shareholders  and  earn out to the former microserv shareholders 
the remainder of the proceeds from the sale of the secure network services business will be used for working capital purposes 
we anticipate that our primary sources of liquidity in fiscal will be cash generated from operations  cash on hand generated from the sale of the secure network services business in june  and cash available to us under our revolving credit agreement 
cash generated from operations may be affected by a number of factors 
see forward looking statements and business risk factors for a discussion of the factors that can negatively impact the amount of cash we generate from our operations 
although we have no definite plans to undertake any future debt or equity financing  we will continue to pursue all potential funding alternatives 
among the possibilities for raising additional funds are issuances of debt or equity securities  and other borrowings under secured or unsecured loan arrangements 
there can be no assurances that additional funds will be available to us on acceptable terms or in a timely manner 
our future financial performance will depend on our ability to continue to reduce and manage operating expenses  as well as our ability to grow revenues through obtaining new contracts and replacing contracts sold in connection with the sale of the secure networks services business 
our revenues will continue to be impacted by the loss of customers due to price competition and technological advances 
our future financial performance could be negatively affected by unforeseen factors and unplanned expenses 
see forward looking statements and business risk factors 
in furtherance of our business strategy  transactions we may enter into could increase or decrease our liquidity at any point in time 
if we were to obtain a significant contract or make contract modifications  we may be required to expend our cash or incur debt  which will decrease our liquidity 
conversely  if we dispose of assets  we may receive proceeds from such sales which could increase our liquidity 
from time to time  we are in discussions concerning acquisitions and dispositions which  if consummated  could impact our liquidity  perhaps significantly 
we expect to continue to require funds to meet remaining interest and principal payment obligations  capital expenditures and other non operating expenses 
see the discussion below including the contractual obligations table 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including revenue growth  expansion of our service offerings and business strategy 
we believe that our available funds  together with our existing revolving credit facility  will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations for at least the next months 
the table below reflects our liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands cash balance at march working capital at march net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investment activities net cash used in provided by financing activities at march   we had working capital of million compared to working capital of million at march  the current ratio was at march  compared to at march  the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to the reclassification of a portion of the deferred tax asset from long term to current as a result of the sale of our secure network services business described elsewhere 
on june  we sold our secure network services business for million 
the gain on the sale of the business is estimated at million net of taxes and fees 
the net cash after taxes and fees is estimated at million 
the proceeds will be used to reduce debt and provide working capital 
a summary of future minimum lease payments is set forth below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures in fiscal year were thousand and in fiscal year were thousand 
we anticipate fiscal year technology requirements to result in capital expenditures totaling approximately thousand 
we continue to sublease a portion of our headquarters building which reduces our rent expense by approximately thousand annually 
on june   we and our subsidiaries amended and restated our amended and restated loan and security agreement  referred to as the revolving credit agreement with provident bank to extend the maturity date to june  and revise the covenants as more fully described in the revolving credit agreement 
the amount available under the revolving credit agreement remains at million 
the amount outstanding under the revolving credit agreement bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus one quarter percent 
we will also pay an unused commitment fee on the difference between the maximum amount we can borrow and the amount advanced  determined by the average daily amount outstanding during the period 
the difference is multiplied by one quarter percent 
this amount is payable on june  and on the last day of each quarter until the revolving credit agreement has been terminated 
additionally  we will pay a fee of  per month 
advances under the revolving credit agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest on all of our assets as defined in the revolving credit agreement 
as of june   million was outstanding and million was available to us 
the interest rate at june  was 
the revolving credit agreement contains representations  warranties and covenants that are that are customary in connection with a transaction of this type 
the revolving credit agreement contains certain covenants including  but not limited to i having all persons or entities required to make payments to us deposit such payments in a cash collateral account by which provident bank  in its own discretion  may  among other things  use such funds against our obligations owed to provident bank  ii notifying provident bank in writing of any cancellation of a contract having annual revenues in excess of  iii in the event receivables arise out of government contracts  we will assign to provident bank all government contracts with amounts payable of  or greater and in duration of six months or longer  iv obtaining written consent from provident bank prior to permitting a change in ownership of more than of the stock or other equity interests of us and our subsidiaries or permit us or any of such entities to enter into any merger or consolidation or sell or lease substantially all of our or its assets  and v obtaining prior written consent of provident bank  subject to exceptions  to make payments of debt to any person or entity or making any distributions of any kind to any officers  employees or members 
the revolving credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants which we are required to maintain including  but not limited to tangible net worth  current ratio  total liabilities to net worth ratio  debt service coverage and current ratio  as more fully described in the revolving credit agreement 
events of default  include  but are not limited to i a determination by provident bank that the financial condition of us or any person or entity that generally is now or hereafter liable  directly  contingently or otherwise obligated to pay provident bank under the revolving credit agreement other obligor is unsatisfactory  ii we or an other obligor becoming insolvent  iii the suspension of business  or commission of an act amounting to business failure by us or any other obligor  and iv a change in more than of the ownership of us without the prior written consent of provident bank 
upon an event of default  the lender may i accelerate and call immediately due and payable all of the unpaid principal  accrued interest and other sums due as of the date of default  ii impose the default rate of interest with or without acceleration  iii file suit against us or any other obligor  iv seek specific performance or injunctive relief to enforce performance of the our obligations v exercise any rights of a secured creditor under the uniform commercial code  vi cease making advances or extending credit to us and stop and retract the making of any advances which we may have requested  and vii reduce the maximum amount we are permitted to borrow under the revolving credit agreement 
we have also authorized provident bank  upon a default  but without prior notice to or demand upon us and without prior opportunity of us to be heard  to institute an action for replevin  with or without bond as provident bank may elect  to obtain possession of any of the collateral 
at december  and march  we were not in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement and have received a waiver from the bank 
in conjunction with amending the revolving credit agreement on june   the bank has waived the compliance requirement of these covenants as of and through march  and amended the covenants prospectively 
we believe that we will remain compliance with the revised covenants of the revolving credit agreement  however  there is no assurance we will be in compliance and the bank will waive any future non compliance with the covenants 
if our customer base were to remain constant  after giving effect to the sale of our secure network services business  we expect to have approximately million available on our revolving credit agreement through the next twelve months 
if we were to obtain a significant new contract or make contract modifications  our borrowing availability may be less since we are generally required to invest significant initial start up funds which are subsequently billed to customers 
the revolving credit agreement prohibits the payment of dividends or distributions as well as limits the payment of principal or interest on our subordinated debt  which is not paid until we obtain a waiver from the bank

we have a consulting advisory service commitment with a former chief executive officer of the company 
from april  through march   we are to pay the former chief executive officer thousand per year for consulting services 
off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with a government contract  we act as a conduit in a financing transaction on behalf of a third party 
we routinely transfer receivables to a third party in connection with equipment leased to end users 
the credit risk passes to the third party at the point of sale of the receivables 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  transfers were accounted for as sales  and as a result  the related receivables have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amount paid to us for the receivables by the transferee is equal to our carrying value and therefore no gain or loss is recognized on these transfers 
the end user remits its monthly payments directly to an escrow account held by a third party from which payments are made to the transferee and us  for various services provided to the end users 
we provide limited monthly servicing whereby we invoice the end user on behalf of the transferee 
the off balance sheet transactions had no impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
we are not aware of any event  demand or uncertainty that would likely terminate the agreement or have an adverse affect on our operations 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements as they affect the updated amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as policies that involve critical accounting estimates that require i management to make assumptions that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and ii different estimates that could have been reasonably used for the current period  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or in results of operations 
based on this definition  our most critical policies include revenue recognition  inventory valuation reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  which impact cost of sales and gross margin  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  which impact write offs of goodwill and intangibles  depreciation of property and equipment  income taxes and legal contingencies 
we discuss these policies further below  as well as the estimates and management s judgments involved 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as policies for revenue recognition  including unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenues  as well as policies governing the estimate of the useful life of our property and equipment 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  to make judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe that the estimates and judgments generally required by these policies are not as difficult or subjective and are less likely to have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
revenue recognition we recognize service revenues based on contracted fees earned  net of credits and adjustments  as the service is performed 
revenues from long term fixed unit price contracts are recognized monthly as service is performed based upon the number of units covered and the level of service requested 
the pricing in these contracts is fixed as to the unit price but varies based upon the number of units covered and service level requested 
revenues from time and material professional service contracts are recognized as services are delivered 
certain seat management contracts include the delivery and installation of new equipment combined with multi year service agreements 
revenues related to the delivery and installation of equipment under these and certain other contracts are recognized upon the completion of both the delivery and installation 
invoices billed in advance are recognized as revenues when earned 
revenues are a function of the mix of long term services contracts and time and material and professional service contracts 
revenues from time and material professional service contracts are difficult to forecast because of wide fluctuations in demand 
the long term contracts are more predictable and  as a result  the revenues stream is less difficult to forecast 
the gross margins on long term contracts vary inversely with the call volume received from customers in any one reporting period 
our expectation is that we will see continued growth in long term contracts  which historically have had higher gross margins  and continued downward pressure on hardware and software margins 
provision for loss contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which they become determinable 
inventory valuation reserves we write down inventory and record obsolescence reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon anticipated future usage  prior demand  equipment use  current and anticipated contracts and market conditions 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecast for inventory usage  a significant unanticipated change in technology could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported value 
if actual demand is less than anticipated  or if our prior usage to support our contracts and anticipated future demand changes  we would be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margins 
for the last three years  our inventory reserve ranged from to of inventory 
the annual charge for fiscal year is projected to be approximately thousand  or to of inventory 
a change in estimate would have an impact on earnings of approximately thousand 
due to economic uncertainties and the dramatic decreases in the cost for computing equipment  we increased our reserve for inventory obsolescence 
the amount charged to expense for reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately million in fiscal year  compared to thousand in fiscal year accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because changes in it can significantly affect net income and treatment of the allowance requires us to anticipate the economic viability of our customers and requires a degree of judgment 
our estimate of bad debt expense is approximately 
of annual revenues 
a change in the estimate by would have an impact on earnings of approximately thousand 
over the past three years bad debts expense represented approximately 
to of revenues 
goodwill and other acquired intangibles we have adopted sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly we no longer amortize goodwill  but will continue to amortize other acquisition related costs 
during fiscal year  amortization of acquisition related intangibles is thousand  up from thousand of amortizable intangibles and acquisition related intangibles and costs in fiscal year we assign useful lives for long lived assets based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and our intended use for those assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate these carrying values may not be recoverable 
any changes in these asset lives would be reported in our statement of operations as soon as any change in estimate is determined 
there has been no material changes in asset lives during the three fiscal years ended march  our impairment review is based on a market approach that uses valuation ratios for publicly traded companies based on the ratio of market price of their stock and or invested capital to various financial parameters 
halifax has been designated as a single reporting unit for financial reporting purposes 
under this method  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value inclusive of goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment and no further analysis is necessary 
if our revenues and cost forecasts are not achieved  we fail to have continued profitability and market acceptance  or the market conditions in the stock market cause the valuation to decline  we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
an assessment of goodwill and intangible assets was conducted for and we have concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets as of march  property and equipment we estimate the useful lives of property and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of our equipment is depreciated over three to ten years 
the estimated useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization in future periods 
we review for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
in assessing impairments  we follow the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  utilizing cash flows which take into account management s estimates of future operations 
income taxes and valuation allowance deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that  if changed  would result in either an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income  the character of income needed to realize future tax benefits  historical financial results adjusted for non recurring items and all other available evidence 
management believes that based on the weight of the evidence  consistent past profitability and estimates of future profitability  including the gain as a result of the sale of our secure network services business  that a valuation allowance is not necessary 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains an analysis of our deferred tax assets 
management will continue to monitor its historical results when adjusted for non recurring items  estimates of future profitability and all other evidence to assess the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based on evolving business conditions 
should management determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  this would have a significant negative effect on net income 
our other results of operations and other forward looking statements contained herein involve a number of risks and uncertainties  in particular  plans to cultivate new business  the ability to expand our footprint  revenues  pricing  gross margins and costs  capital spending  depreciation and amortization  and potential future impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the factors discussed above  other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include but are not limited to the following business and economic conditions in the areas we serve  possible disruption in commercial activities related to terrorist activities  reduced end user purchases relative to expectations  pricing pressures and excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory values 
we believe that we have the enterprise maintenance solutions offerings  facilities  personnel and competitive resources for continued business success 
however  future revenues  costs  margins and profits are influenced by a number of factors  including those discussed above  all of which are difficult to forecast

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of bank debt to finance our business 
the floating interest rate exposes us to interest rate risk  with the primary interest rate exposure resulting from changes in the prime rate 
it is assumed in the table below that the prime rate will remain constant in the future 
adverse changes in the interest rates or our inability to refinance our long term obligations may have a material negative impact on our operations 
the definitive extent of our interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
we do not believe such risk is material 
we do not customarily use derivative instruments to adjust our interest rate risk profile 
the information below summarizes our sensitivity to market risks as of march  the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity of our funded debt

total fixed debt total debt at present  all transactions are billed and denominated in us dollars and consequently  we do not currently have any material exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk 
at march   we had million of debt outstanding  of which million bore fixed interest rates 
if interest rates charges to us on our variable rate debt were to increase significantly  the effect could be materially adverse to our operations 
subsequent to year end  we have requested and received consent from the bank to pay million to the affiliates paying the thousand face amount of our convertible subordinated debt  thousand and thousand face amounts of our promissory notes in full 
with the amendment of the revolving credit agreement the due date on the notes was extended to july  we conduct a limited amount of business overseas  principally in western europe  and in mexico and canada 
at the present  all transactions are billed and denominated in us dollars and consequently  we do not currently have any material exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk
