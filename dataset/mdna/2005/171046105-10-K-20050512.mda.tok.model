requires construction allowances to be recorded as deferred lease incentives in the liability section of the balance sheet and allowances received to be recorded as a component of operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
previously  construction allowances were treated as reductions of property  equipment  and improvements on the company s consolidated balance sheet and as a reduction of capital expenditures within the investing activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
accordingly  the company has established the appropriate deferred lease incentive liability and recorded a corresponding increase in property  equipment and improvements 
additionally  the amortization of construction allowances has been classified as a reduction of rent expense as part of cost of sales  rather then a reduction of depreciation expense in the company s consolidated income statement

the company typically does not expand or relocate stores within a mall 
stores where square footage has been changed by more than percent are excluded from the same store sales calculation 
stores closed during the year are included in the same store sales calculation only for the full months of the year the stores were open 
management considers same store sales to be an important indicator of the company s performance 
same store sales results are important in achieving leveraging of costs  including store payroll  store occupancy  depreciation and other general and administrative expenses

the company further reduces the value of inventory by recording an allowance for permanent markdowns based on inventory levels from the season which immediately precedes the current season as of the reporting date 
permanent markdowns on this merchandise take into account the future anticipated selling price of the inventory 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may have to be recorded  which could reduce the company s gross margins and adversely affect its financial position and results of operations 
for the fiscal years ended february   february  and march   permanent inventory markdowns totaled   and  respectively

the company reviews property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the net book value of an asset may not be recoverable  but at least annually 
an impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition

rent expense and deferred rent obligations rent expense under non cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or free rent periods is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term  beginning on the date of initial possession  which is generally when the company enters the space and begins the construction build out 
most of the company s lease agreements for retail space include escalation clauses in minimum base rent 
for leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of minimum rent  the company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight line basis and records the difference between the recognized rent expense and amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent obligations

as of february   the company s other liabilities consisted of deferred rent  deferred lease incentives  deferred revenue and deferred income taxes 
the company does not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships 
the company s related party transactions are limited to employment agreements with certain officers 
in addition  the company does not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any of its suppliers 
merchandise sourcing the company directly imported approximately of its total merchandise purchases in fiscal this reliance on sourcing from foreign countries may cause the company to be exposed to certain risks 
import restrictions  including tariffs and quotas  and changes in such restrictions  could affect the import of apparel and might result in increased costs  delays in merchandise receipts or reduced supplies of apparel available to the company and could possibly have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company s merchandise flow could also be adversely affected by political or financial instability in any of the countries where its merchandise is manufactured or by changes in the united states governmental policies toward such foreign countries 
in addition  merchandise receipts could be delayed due to interruptions in air  ocean and ground shipments 
substantially all of the company s directly imported merchandise is manufactured in southeast asia 
the majority of these goods are produced in china  hong kong  indonesia and singapore 
the company is not currently importing merchandise produced in the middle east 
the company did not experience any significant disruption or delays in the production or shipment of merchandise resulting from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami which struck parts of indonesia and other countries surrounding the indian ocean on december  during fiscal  the company purchased substantially all of its merchandise for its christopher banks and cj banks stores from approximately vendors and the company s ten largest vendors represented approximately of the company s purchases 
further  purchases from the company s largest overseas supplier accounted for of total purchases in fiscal  compared to in fiscal although the company believes that its relationship with this particular vendor is good  there can be no assurance that this relationship can be maintained in the future or that the vendor will continue to supply merchandise to the company 
if there should be any significant disruption in the supply of merchandise from this vendor  management believes that it can shift production to other suppliers so as to continue to secure the required volume of product 
nevertheless  there is some potential that any such disruption in supply could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company intends to directly import approximately of its purchases in fiscal quota restrictions on december   quota restrictions expired on the importing of apparel in the united states from foreign countries which are members of the world trade organization 
the effect this quota expiration will have on global sourcing patterns is uncertain  but is likely to cause further retail price deflation 
management believes it can adjust to potential shifts in the availability of apparel following the expiration of these quotas 
however  the company s sourcing operations may be adversely effected by trade limits or political and financial instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries 
quarterly results and seasonality the company s sales reflect seasonal variation as sales in the third and fourth quarters  which include the fall and holiday seasons  generally have been higher than sales in the first and second quarters

the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through in return  the act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extraterritorial income exclusion eti for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union

certain additional business risk factors investors in the company should consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained herein 
need for optimal retail store locations the success of individual retail stores will depend to a great extent on locating them in desirable shopping venues in markets where the company s target customers shop 
the success of individual stores may depend on the success of the shopping malls or lifestyle centers in which they are located 
in addition  the demographic and other marketing data the company relies on in determining the location of its stores cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy 
as a result  retail stores the company opens may not be profitable or may be less successful than anticipated 
effective management of growth strategy the company s continued growth depends on its ability to open and operate stores successfully and to manage the company s planned expansion 
during fiscal  the company plans to open approximately new stores  including approximately christopher banks stores  cj banks stores  and five acorn stores 
the company s planned expansion is dependent upon a number of factors  including locating suitable store sites  negotiating favorable lease terms  sourcing sufficient levels of inventory  hiring and training qualified management level and other employees and integrating new stores into its existing operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its planned expansion or that such expansion will be profitable or that the company will be able to manage its growth effectively 
changing customer preferences the company s future success will depend on its ability to continually select the right merchandise assortment  maintain appropriate inventory levels and creatively present merchandise in a way that is appealing to its customers 
consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty  as they continually change and vary from region to region 
on average  the company begins the design process for its apparel six to seven months before merchandise is available to its customers and the company typically begins to make purchase commitments four to five months in advance 
these lead times make it difficult for the company to respond quickly to changing consumer preferences and amplify the consequences of any misjudgments it might make in anticipating customer preferences 
consequently  if the company misjudges its customers merchandise preferences or purchasing habits  its sales may decline significantly  and the company may be required to mark down certain products to significantly lower prices to sell excess inventory  which would result in lower margins 
fluctuations in comparable store sales results the company s comparable store sales results have fluctuated in the past on a monthly  quarterly and annual basis  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
a variety of factors affect comparable store sales results  including changes in fashion trends  changes in the company s merchandise mix  calendar shifts of holiday periods  actions by competitors  weather conditions and general economic conditions 
past comparable store sales results are not an indicator of future results  and there can be no assurance that the company s comparable store sales results will not decrease in the future 
the company s comparable store sales results are likely to have a significant effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
competition the retail apparel industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with national and local department stores  specialty and discount store chains and independent retail stores that market similar lines of merchandise 
many competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources and enjoy greater national  regional and local name recognition than does the company 
depth of selection in sizes  colors and styles of merchandise  merchandise procurement and pricing  ability to anticipate fashion trends and consumer preferences  inventory control  reputation  quality of merchandise  store design and location  brand recognition and customer service are all important factors in competing successfully in the retail industry 
the company s successful performance in recent years has increased the amount of imitation by other retailers 
such imitation has made and will continue to make the retail environment in which the company operates more competitive 
general economic conditions the company s business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences  which are dictated in part by fashion and season 
in addition  certain economic conditions affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise offered by the company  including  among others  unemployment levels  business conditions  interest rates and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
consumer preference and economic conditions may differ or change from time to time in each market in which the company operates and negatively affect the company s net sales and profitability 
reliance on key personnel the company s success and ability to properly manage its growth depends to a significant extent both upon the performance of its current executive and senior management team and its ability to attract  hire  motivate and retain additional qualified management personnel in the future 
the company s inability to recruit and retain such additional personnel  or the loss of the services of any of its executive officers  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and there can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will not continue to fluctuate significantly 
future announcements or management discussions concerning the company or its competitors  sales and profitability results  quarterly variations in operating results or monthly comparable store net sales  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies  among other factors  could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock markets  in general  have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments and in its financial position represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company s results of operations could be negatively impacted by decreases in interest rates on its short term investments 
the company is potentially exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates relating to its revolving credit and security agreement with wells fargo bank 
loans under the wells fargo revolver bear interest at wells fargo s fluctuating base rate  as of february   plus 
however  the company had no revolving credit loan borrowings under the wells fargo revolver during fiscal or and  given its existing liquidity position  does not expect to utilize the wells fargo revolver in the near future except for its continuing use of the import letter of credit facility 
the company enters into certain purchase obligations outside the united states  which are settled in us dollars 
therefore  the company has only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
the company does not hedge against foreign currency risks and believes that the foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial 
the company does not have any derivative financial instruments and does not hold any instruments for trading purposes
