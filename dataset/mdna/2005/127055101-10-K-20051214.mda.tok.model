item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary factors that may affect future results this report on form k contains forward looking statements under the federal securities laws 
these forward looking statements include statements relating to our future business performance and overall prospects  prospects for the supermetals business  including the potential impact of the arbitration between us and the sons of gwalia  growth in inkjet colorants and the specialty fluids business  raw material and energy costs  planned and expected capacity increases  anticipated capital spending  cost reduction initiatives  cash requirements and uses of available cash  exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk  expected tax rate  environmental matters  and the outcome of legal proceedings 
from time to time  we also provide forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public and in oral statements made by authorized officers 
forward looking statements are based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about cabot s businesses and strategies  market trends and conditions  economic conditions and other factors 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties  potentially inaccurate assumptions  and other factors  some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict 
if known or unknown risks materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  our actual results could differ materially from past results and from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law 
investors are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures cabot makes on related subjects in its q and k reports filed with the sec 
in addition to factors described elsewhere in this report  the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements 
it is not possible  however  to predict or identify all such factors 
accordingly  investors should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 
demand for our products on a worldwide basis could affect our future performance 
cabot s key customers in mature carbon black markets such as north america and europe continue to shift their manufacturing capacity from those regions to developing regions such as asia  south america and eastern europe 
although we are responding to meet these market demand conditions  there is no assurance that we will be successful 
similarly  demand for our customers products and our competitors reactions to market conditions could affect our results 
our rubber blacks  performance products and fumed metal oxides product lines are sensitive to industry capacity utilization 
as a result  pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization in these product lines change  which could affect our financial performance 
our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods could affect our future results 
three major tire customers  one silicones customer  three capacitor materials customers and one microelectronics customer represent a material portion of cabot s total net sales and operating revenues 
in fiscal year  sales to the goodyear tire and rubber company by our rubber blacks product line amounted to approximately of our consolidated revenues 
the loss of any one or more of our important customers could materially adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced 
in addition  any deterioration of the financial condition of any of our customers that impairs their ability to make payments to us could affect our future results and financial condition 
a material portion of our sales are made to customers under long term and annual contracts 
the loss or expiration of any of these customer contracts could increase the volatility of our business results 
the cost  availability and quality of raw materials affect our results 
dramatic increases in such costs or decreases in the availability of raw materials at acceptable costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
for example  if proposed environmental regulations applicable to the european 
table of contents carbon black industry that call for a reduction in the annual average sulfur content in carbon black feedstock are adopted  we may experience some difficulty obtaining low sulfur feedstock at an acceptable cost for our european operations 
moreover  although our long term and some of our annual carbon black supply contracts provide for a price adjustment to account for changes in feedstock costs  the pricing formula results in a lag between the time feedstock costs are incurred by us and the time when prices are increased under the contracts 
accordingly  we may not be able to pass increased costs along to our customers during the quarter in which they occur  which can have a significant negative impact in a given quarter 
in addition  it is possible that a supply contract with a price adjustment mechanism could expire by its terms before we are able to recapture fully our raw material cost increases 
we are in arbitration with the sons of gwalia regarding the price at which we will purchase tantalum ore under our long term raw materials contract 
depending on the outcome of the arbitration  we could be obligated to buy tantalum ore under that contract at well above our current prices for up to a five year period 
we have manufacturing and marketing operations throughout the world  with approximately of our revenues in attributable to sales outside the united states 
we have exposure to certain risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and political or country risks inherent in doing business in some countries 
the political risks may include actions of governments  importing and exporting issues  contract loss and asset abandonment 
in particular  our business could be affected by political uncertainty within the asia pacific  china and south american regions 
we consider these currency and political risks carefully in connection with our investment and operations activities 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note u of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for more information about foreign currency risk 
the risk management discussion included in the md a and estimated amounts generated from the analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the methods used by cabot to assess and mitigate risks should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
we expect capacity expansions in both brazil and china to come online in fiscal year for the rubber blacks  performance products and metal oxides product lines 
in the inkjet colorants product line  we intend to invest approximately million to expand our current production capacity 
our ability to complete capacity expansions as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals  availability of labor and materials  unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions  and other risks customarily associated with construction projects 
moreover  capacity expansion in our rubber blacks  performance products  fumed metal oxides and inkjet colorants product lines could have a negative impact on the product line s business performance until capacity utilization is sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with the expansion 
we have undertaken and will continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve operating efficiencies and generate cost savings 
there can be no assurance that these will be completed as planned or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be realized 
in addition to cost reduction initiatives  we try to improve margins on our non contracted sales through price increases 
however  such increases may not be accepted by our customers  may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs  or may negatively affect demand and volume 
our strategic focus includes optimizing our core businesses and investing the cash and intellectual resources they generate in developing new businesses 
there can be no assurance that the costs incurred investing in these new businesses will result in a proportional increase in revenues or profits 
in addition  the timely commercialization of products under development by cabot  which may be disrupted or delayed by technical difficulties  market acceptance  competitors new products  as well as 
table of contents difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage  could affect our future results 
as part of our strategies for growth and improved profitability  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments and enter into joint ventures 
the completion of such transactions is subject to receiving on a timely basis necessary regulatory and other consents and approvals  which could be delayed for a variety of reasons 
the completion of such transactions could also be delayed by the satisfactory negotiation of transaction documents and the fulfillment of closing conditions to the transactions 
also  there can be no assurance that such transactions will be successfully completed on a timely and cost efficient basis or that they will achieve anticipated operating earnings 
in our analysis of the recoverability of certain assets  namely inventory  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and deferred tax assets  we have made assumptions about future sales pricing  volume and region of sale  costs  cash generation and the ultimate profitability of the business and or tax jurisdiction 
these assumptions were based on management s best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions  we may not be able to recover the assets recorded as of september   which could lead to a write off of certain of these assets in the future 
our facilities and businesses are subject to complex safety  health and environmental requirements 
we spend  and will continue to spend  significant amounts to comply with such requirements  which could adversely affect our profitability 
as more fully described in item safety  health and environment  cabot has been named as a potentially responsible party under the us superfund law and comparable state statutes with respect to several sites 
during the next several years  as remediation of various environmental sites is carried out  we expect to spend a significant portion of our environmental reserve for costs associated with such remediation 
we anticipate that the expenditures at these superfund sites will be made over a number of years  and will not be concentrated in any one year 
however  we may also incur future costs relating to sites that are not currently known to us or as to which it is currently not possible to make an estimate 
as described in item safety  health and environment  since the mid s  various state  federal and foreign agencies have taken actions to address concerns that carbon black might be carcinogenic 
the international agency for research on cancer iarc will review the classification of carbon black regarding carcinogenicity in february  and as a result  it is possible that iarc could change the classification of carbon black from possible human carcinogen to probable or known human carcinogen 
in the event iarc does change the classification of carbon black to probable human carcinogen group a or known human carcinogen group  this change would impose additional labeling and other hazard communication requirements on cabot 
we are not able to determine what other impacts would be associated with a reclassification of carbon black to group a or group it is possible that such a reclassification could lead customers to evaluate possible substitutes to the use of carbon black in their products and it could lead regulators to consider changing the occupational exposure and other regulatory limits for carbon black 
as more fully described in item legal proceedings  cabot is a party to or the subject of lawsuits  claims  and proceedings  including those involving contract  environmental  antitrust  and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis  silicosis and berylliosis 
adverse rulings  judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation including carbon black antitrust claims and liabilities associated with respirator claims could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward looking statements 
we own and are a licensee of various patents covering many of our products  as well as processes and product uses 
nonetheless  there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that our products  processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
these claims  even if they are without merit  could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims  we could be subject to injunctions or damages or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available to cabot on acceptable terms or at all 

table of contents in addition to the factors described above  the following other factors  among others  could affect our future performance and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by any forward looking statements changes in the rate of economic growth in the united states and other major international economies  changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies throughout the world  fluctuations in interest rates  stock market conditions  acts of war and terrorist activities  and the impact of global health and safety concerns on economic conditions and market opportunities 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and if different estimates and assumptions were used  the result could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are presented below 
revenue recognition we derive most of our revenues from the sale of rubber blacks  performance products  fumed metal oxides  tantalum and related products and from the rental and sale of cesium formate 
revenue from product sales is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
revenue from the rental of cesium formate is recognized throughout the rental period based on the contracted rental amount 
customers are also billed and revenue is recognized  typically at the end of the job  for cesium formate product that is not returned 
other operating revenues  which represents less than ten percent of total revenues  include tolling  servicing and royalties for licensed technology 
our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which establishes criteria that must be satisfied before revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment 
if we are unable to determine that the product has met the specified objective criteria prior to shipment  the revenue is deferred until product acceptance has occurred 
under certain multi year supply contracts with declining prices and minimum volumes  we recognize revenue based on the estimated average selling price over the contract lives 
certain customer contracts contain price protection clauses that provide for the potential reduction in past or future sales prices 
we analyze these contract provisions to determine if an obligation related to these clauses exists 
while such price protection clauses have not created a significant obligation for us  significant changes in future sales prices could adversely impact our revenue 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of our accounts receivable and other economic information on both a historical and prospective basis 
additionally  we estimate sales returns based on historical trends in our customers product returns 
while bad debt charge offs and product returns have not been significant historically  if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness  actual defaults are higher than our previous experience or actual returns do not reflect historical trends  our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due us and our sales would be adversely affected 
we offer sales discounts and volume rebates to certain customers 
we prepare estimates for these discounts and rebates based primarily on historical experience and contractual obligations updated for changes 
table of contents in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
if sales are significantly different from our historical experience  our estimates of sales discounts and volume rebates would be affected 
inventory valuation the cost of most raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories in the us is determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
had we used the first in  first out fifo method instead of the lifo method for such inventories the value of those inventories would have been million and million higher as of september  and  respectively 
the cost of other us and all us inventories is determined using the average cost method or the fifo method 
we review inventory for potential obsolescence recoverability periodically 
in this review  we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and based on these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete  unmarketable or slow moving inventory 
we write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in cases where the market value of inventories is below cost  the inventory is adjusted to its market value 
historically  such write downs have not been significant 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment  however  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could have a negative impact on gross profit 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an impairment test for goodwill at least annually and when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
to test whether an impairment exists  the fair value of the applicable reporting unit is estimated based on discounted cash flows 
the calculation is sensitive to both the estimated future cash flows and the discount rate 
the assumptions used to estimate the discounted cash flows are based on management s best estimates about selling prices  production and sales volume  costs  future growth rates  capital expenditures and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital that is determined by evaluating the risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premiums 
if an impairment exists  a loss to write down the value of goodwill to its implied fair value is recorded 
valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets primarily include property  plant  equipment  long term investments and assets held for rent 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market price of the long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the way the asset is being used  a decline in the physical condition of the asset or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
we make various estimates and assumptions when analyzing whether there is an impairment of our long lived assets  excluding goodwill and long term investments 
these estimates and assumptions include determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life of the asset over which the cash flows will occur  their amounts and the asset s residual value  if any 
an asset impairment exists when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable based on the undiscounted estimated cash flows expected from the asset 
the impairment loss is determined by the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value 
our estimated cash flows reflect management s assumptions about selling prices  production and sales volume  costs and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining useful life 
the fair values of long term investments are dependent on the financial performance of the entities in which the company invests and the external factors inherent in the markets in which they operate 
we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investment entities when assessing the potential impairment of these investments 

table of contents pensions and other postretirement benefits we maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees 
in addition  we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
the assumptions  which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans  are related to general economic conditions  including interest rates  expected return on plan assets  and the rate of compensation increases for employees 
projected health care benefits reflect our assumptions about health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on participant demographic assumptions including assumptions regarding retirements  mortality  employee turnover and plan participation levels 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
litigation and contingencies cabot is involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury and environmental litigation 
after consultation with counsel  as appropriate  we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range 
our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information  including claims  settlement offers  demands by government agencies  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute and our prior experience 
litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may have an adverse effect on the results of operations 
the most significant reserves that we have established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims 
as of september   we had million reserved for various environmental matters 
the amount accrued reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated sites  the nature of the remedies  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
a portion of the reserve for environmental matters is recognized on a discounted basis  which requires the use of an estimated discount rate and estimates of future cash flows associated with the liability 
these liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information  changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in applicable government laws and regulations  which could result in higher or lower costs 
as of september   we also had million accrued for respirator liability claims 
our current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time 
developments that could affect our estimate include  but are not limited to  i significant changes in the number of future claims  ii significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims  iii significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims  iv changes in the nature of claims received  v changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims  vi the financial viability of other parties who contribute to the settlement of respirator claims  and vii a determination that our interpretation of the contractual obligations on which we have estimated our share of liability is inaccurate 
while we believe the current best estimate is recorded  we cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims 
accordingly  the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be different than the reserved amount 
income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we are subject to tax 
this process involves estimating the tax exposure for differences between actual results and estimated results and recording the 
table of contents amount of income taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and valuation allowances are provided as required 
in making this assessment  we are required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgement 
in addition  we have made significant estimates involving current and deferred income taxes 
we do not recognize current and future tax benefits until it is deemed probable that certain tax positions will be sustained 
we have filed our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction s tax laws and have established reserves for potential differences in interpretation of those laws 
in the event that actual results are significantly different from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be significantly impacted 
a change in the effective tax rate would change income tax expense by million as of september  significant accounting policies we have other significant accounting policies that are discussed in note a of the notes to our consolidated financial statement in item below 
certain of these policies include the use of estimates  but do not meet the definition of critical because they generally do not require estimates or judgements that are as difficult or subjective to measure 
however  these policies are important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations during the last quarter of fiscal year  management changed its segment reporting structure to better reflect the way we manage and think about our businesses 
under the new reporting structure  we are organized into four reportable segments the carbon black business  the metal oxides business  the supermetals business csm  and the specialty fluids business csf 
the carbon black business is comprised of the rubber blacks  performance products and inkjet colorants product lines as well as the business development activities of superior micropowders 
the metal oxides business is comprised of the fumed metal oxides and aerogel product lines 
discussions of prior period results reflect the new segment structure 
the discussion of our results includes information on diluted earnings per share  segment and product line sales  and segment operating profit before taxes pbt 
we use segment pbt to measure our consolidated operating results and assess segment performance 
this discussion has been prepared on a basis consistent with segment reporting as outlined in note w of the consolidated financial statements 
refer to note w of the consolidated financial statements for a definition of segment pbt and additional segment information 
our analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
unless a calendar year is specified  all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended september overview our results in fiscal year were impacted by several impairment charges associated with the supermetals business  which reflect our lower expectations of this business s future performance 
these charges included a million goodwill asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter and a million asset impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we also recorded a million charge for cost reduction efforts in the supermetals business and our decision to exit the finished tantalum sputtering targets business 
during fiscal year  we experienced strong volume growth for all product lines within the carbon black business 
however  results for this business were negatively impacted by significant increases in raw 
table of contents material costs in the rubber blacks and performance products product lines  particularly in the second half of the year 
in the metal oxides business there was a shift in sales volumes within the fumed metal oxides product line  with decreases in sales to the electronics segment being more than offset by increases in sales to other market segments 
this shift in volumes had a negative impact on the price mix of sales within the fumed metal oxides product line  which is reflected in the results for fiscal year in addition to the charges discussed above  the supermetals business was negatively impacted by lower prices despite strong volume growth during the fiscal year  due to the continuing shift from fixed price and fixed volume contracts to market based pricing 
this business was also negatively impacted by the incremental costs associated with the labor dispute resulting from the expiration of the company s collective bargaining agreement with one of the labor unions at our facility in boyertown  pennsylvania 
in the specialty fluids business  a substantial increase in the volume of fluid being used had a positive impact on the profitability of that business in fiscal year our consolidated working capital increased during the year  which resulted in a lower operating cash flow compared to prior years 
we continue to focus our efforts on improving our overall working capital position 
as a result of these efforts  during the second half of the year we reduced finished goods inventory 
however  this was offset by an increase in raw materials costs in the carbon black business 
working capital and operating cash flow are discussed in more detail in the cash flow and liquidity section below 
fiscal year compared with fiscal years and consolidated net sales and gross profit we reported sales of  million   million and  million in fiscal years ending september   and  respectively 
the increase in sales in fiscal year was primarily due to higher volumes million  higher pricing million and the positive impact of foreign currency translation million 
the increase in sales in fiscal year was primarily due to higher volumes in the carbon black business  the specialty fluids business and the fumed metal oxides product line within the metal oxides business million  as well as the positive impact of foreign currency translations million offset partially by lower volumes in the supermetals business million and unfavorable price mix in the carbon black and supermetals businesses million 
gross margin was in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year the decrease in gross margin during fiscal year resulted in a negative impact on gross profit million 
overall gross profit decreased million in fiscal year primarily resulting from higher raw material costs in the rubber blacks and performance products product lines of the carbon black business million and lower prices in the supermetals business million offset partially by higher prices in the carbon black business million 
the increase in gross margin during fiscal year resulted in a positive impact to gross profit million 
overall gross profit increased million in fiscal year resulting from higher volumes in the carbon black  metal oxides and specialty fluids businesses million and a decrease in charges from certain items included in costs of sales million 
also impacting gross profit in were cost improvements resulting from the excellence initiative we undertook in to improve our overall operating performance million 
many of the cost savings achieved under the excellence initiative were maintained  and new savings were attained  in fiscal year however  these savings did not incrementally impact results in as significantly as in the decrease in charges from certain items in was mostly due to restructuring costs related to the closure of the zierbena  spain carbon black facility  the consolidation of administrative services for the european businesses into one shared service center and a reduction in workforce in north america 
partially offsetting these benefits in were lower volumes in the supermetals business million and unfavorable price mix million in the carbon black and supermetals businesses 
selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expenses for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to planned increases in 
table of contents personnel costs million  incremental costs associated with the labor dispute at our supermetals facility in boyertown  pennsylvania million  an increase in costs related to the implementation of the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of million and an increase in spending related to the company s business process improvement initiative undertaken in fiscal year million 
the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to the inclusion in of million of certain items related to restructuring initiatives in europe and north america and the recording of a reserve for our potential liabilities associated with our respirator litigation partially offset by insurance recoveries 
research and technical expense research and technical spending was million for fiscal year compared with million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year compared to was due primarily to increased spending for the development activities of superior micropowders 
research and technical spending was lower in fiscal year than in primarily because of the million of acquired in process research and development technology related to the purchase of superior micropowders in that was expensed and recorded in research and technical expense at the time of the acquisition 
interest and dividend income and interest expense interest and dividend income was million in fiscal years and and million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in our average cash position and the positive impact of higher interest rates paid on our cash balances 
interest expense was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to the capitalization of interest related to the construction of a new carbon black facility in china and the expansion of our existing facility in brazil  which was partially offset by increases in interest expense due to increases in our average debt outstanding year over year 
in fiscal year  interest expense increases were due primarily to the issuance of million of ten year bonds in september at fixed rates that replaced a lower floating rate bank debt 
other income expense we reported other income of million in fiscal year  compared to expense of million in fiscal year and income of million in fiscal year the increase in other income in fiscal year is primarily due to the inclusion of million of expense related to certain items in fiscal year these certain items included million related to the write down of our investment in the sons of gwalia as well as million of charges related to currency translation adjustments 
also contributing to the increase in fiscal year is million of income related to insurance recoveries and million of income related to currency translation adjustments recorded in fiscal year other income in fiscal year included the gain on the sale of our equity interest in aearo corporation for million 
this income was partially offset by the write down of investments in the sons of gwalia and angus ross of million as well as costs associated with the refinancing of debt 
effective tax rate the income tax benefit in fiscal year was million 
our effective tax rate on continuing operations for fiscal year was a benefit of compared to a provision of in fiscal year excluding the million tax settlement recognized in the fourth quarter discussed below and the goodwill impairment and long lived asset impairment charges within the supermetals business in the second and fourth quarters  respectively  the company s effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal year would have been approximately 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from actual to adjusted was principally the result of a decrease in earnings in certain jurisdictions combined with the impact of fixed dollar tax savings on these lower earnings 
we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to be between and before the results of several on going audits 

table of contents income tax expense in fiscal year was million 
our effective tax rate on continuing operations was compared to in fiscal year the income tax rates reflect the us statutory rate of increased by a charge for a valuation allowance on the sons of gwalia investment loss and reduced for earnings in non us jurisdictions that were taxed at rates lower than the us rate  benefits from extraterritorial income exclusion  benefits from us research and experimentation credits  and the benefit from a competent authority filing resolved in competent authority is an administrative procedure provided in tax treaties to mitigate the potential double taxation arising from audit adjustments made by one tax jurisdiction with respect to cross border transactions 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to was principally due to the combined impact of fixed dollar tax savings and higher earnings in certain jurisdictions 
on july   the united kingdom uk enacted legislation retroactive to march  that eliminates a tax benefit associated with certain debt arrangements among subsidiaries where the debt arrangements lack sufficient business purpose 
although the company believes that its existing finance structure in the uk serves legitimate business purposes  the uk inland revenue could challenge this position 
given the uncertainty as to the applicability of the legislation to the company s uk finance structure  the company has reflected the loss of the post march  tax benefit in the financial statements of the fourth quarter of  increasing tax expense by approximately million 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of tax related assets and liabilities and income tax provisions 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment we are required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgement 
in addition  we have made significant estimates involving current and deferred income taxes 
we do not recognize current and future tax benefits until it is deemed probable that certain tax positions will be sustained 
we believe that we are more likely than not to recover our net us deferred tax assets of million through expected future taxable income 
however  recovery is dependent on achieving our forecast of future operating income over an extended period of time 
as of september   we would require approximately million in cumulative future us operating income  adjusted for permanent differences to be generated at various times over approximately years to realize our net us deferred tax assets 
we will review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on an ongoing basis 
failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our us deferred tax assets 
any increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense  lower stockholders equity and could have a significant impact on our earnings in future periods 
in the normal course of business  the tax filings of cabot and its subsidiaries are examined by various tax authorities  including the internal revenue service irs 
in october  the irs concluded its examination of the to tax years resulting in an initial tax assessment of million 
we appealed certain of the irs determinations to the appeals office of the irs and in september  a settlement of these issues was agreed to with the appeals office that reduced the assessment to million  subject to joint committee review 
additionally  we filed refund claims with the irs for million including million of interest for the carryback of research and foreign tax credits from the periods under examination into the and tax years 
the refund claims were examined by the irs and were reviewed by joint committee 
we recorded the benefit of the credits in our financial statements in the years generated  but did not accrue the interest 
in september  the joint committee approved the final settlement of the to audit and the refund claims 
the result of this was a tax benefit of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and a cash refund of million which will be received in fiscal year the tax benefit related to the reversal of previously recorded reserves and previously unrecorded interest 

table of contents cabot is presently under audit and or in settlement discussions with the irs for the to tax years and with a number of non us tax authorities 
cabot expects some of these audits to be resolved during  which may impact our effective tax rate 
in october  the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income 
cabot is both an exporter and a domestic manufacturer 
the loss of the export incentive tax benefit for cabot is expected to materially exceed the tax benefit of the domestic manufacturing deduction tax benefit 
the ajca also allows us companies to repatriate up to million of earnings from their foreign subsidiaries in or at an effective tax rate of 
the company does not expect to take advantage of this opportunity  nor does it expect that there is a material benefit available  given our particular circumstances and the various requirements under the law 
the company  however  will continue to study the impact and opportunities of the ajca as additional guidance becomes available from the irs 
in response  the fasb has issued staff positions fsp no 
and  which outline accounting treatment for the impacts of ajca 
the fsps state that i any benefit that companies may have from the domestic manufacturing deduction should be treated as a special deduction and accordingly any benefit would be reported in the year in which the income is earned and ii regarding the impact resulting from the repatriation of unremitted earnings in the period in which the enacted tax law was passed  companies may wait until they have the information necessary to determine the amount of the earnings they intend to repatriate 
equity in net income of affiliates our share of earnings from equity affiliates was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase of million in fiscal year was due to improved operating results in our affiliates in mexico  malaysia  venezuela and japan 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we began to recognize our share of earnings from our equity affiliate in japan as we have recovered our previously recognized losses associated with this affiliate 
the increase of million in fiscal year was due to improved operating results in our affiliates in mexico and venezuela offset by a decrease in results from our affiliate in malaysia

table of contents product line sales summary the following table sets forth sales by product line for the carbon black business for fiscal years  and dollars in millions rubber blacks performance products inkjet colorants superior micropowders total carbon black sales rubber blacks volumes in the rubber blacks product line grew during fiscal year due to growth in china and other developing regions as well as increased volumes under our long term supply contracts with two major tire companies 
during fiscal year  however  profitability of this product line was negatively impacted by higher raw material and other energy costs  principally during the second half of the fiscal year 
although prices increased during the fiscal year  actual feedstock cost increases were higher than the feedstock cost adjustments provided by the majority of this product line s long term or year to year contracts 
during  the rubber blacks product line volumes increased as a result of continued growth in the asia pacific and china regions and increasing volumes under a new contract with an existing large tire customer 
these volume increases and a strong focus on both manufacturing and administrative cost reductions during the year contributed to significant improvement in the performance of the business in we are generally able to recover increased feedstock costs and  therefore  maintain margins through the operation of pricing formulas in our annual and long term supply contracts 
most of our contracts provide for a price adjustment on the first day of each quarter to account for changes in feedstock costs  and  in some cases  changes in other relevant costs 
the feedstock adjustments are calculated in the month prior to the beginning of the quarter in which the price change is effective  and typically are based upon the average of a relevant index over the prior three month period 
because of this time lag  during both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  the increase in our actual feedstock costs was greater than the cost adjustment resulting from the formulas which use the relevant index averages during the months of december through february and march through may  respectively 
accordingly  the contract prices applicable during the third and fourth quarters did not reflect our increased feedstock costs during those quarters 
over time  if feedstock costs decline  the financial impact of this lag on our long term contracts should be mitigated 
performance products during  volumes in the performance products product line grew resulting primarily from an increase in sales in the asia pacific and china regions 
during fiscal year  however  the profitability of the product line was negatively impacted by higher raw material and other energy costs 
raw material cost increases outpaced both contracted and non contracted price increases during the fiscal year 
during  performance products volumes increased as a result of continued growth across all regions 
these volume increases and a strong focus on both manufacturing and administrative cost reductions during the year contributed to significant improvement in the performance of the business in inkjet colorants inkjet colorants reported a increase in revenue from during to and a increase from to due to strong volumes in both the oem and after market segments of the product line in both 
table of contents fiscal years and volumes for fiscal year increased when compared to fiscal year although the increase in volumes during both fiscal years and had a positive impact on the profitability of this product line  this positive impact was partially offset by ongoing investment in both manufacturing and research and development which continued during fiscal year and to support the growth of this product line 
during the third quarter of fiscal  several printer manufacturers announced anticipated inkjet printer launches 
our inkjet colorants are included in two of these printers that are targeted at the small office and home office markets 
during the fiscal year  inkjet colorants continued to make progress in developing treated pigments to enable inkjet printing to compete with other printing technologies and penetrate markets for higher volume printing applications 
outlook for looking forward  we believe that the carbon black business is fundamentally healthy and  should energy prices stabilize  is well positioned to return to a gross margin level that is more consistent with historical results 
however  we expect that the time lag we experienced in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year between the increases in actual feedstock costs and the contracted feedstock cost adjustments used within our rubber blacks and performance products product lines  as discussed above  will continue into the first quarter of fiscal year due to continued increases in energy costs 
new capacity expansions in both china and brazil are expected to come online in fiscal year and we are optimistic about continued growth in both the rubber blacks and performance products product lines to support this new capacity 
in the inkjet colorants product line  we anticipate additional printer launches in the near future to include our pigments  which could have a significant positive impact on the volume and performance of the inkjet colorants product line 
in anticipation of increased demand  we plan to spend approximately million in fiscal year to expand our inkjet colorant production capacity 
in addition  we expect our polymer attachment technology to create viable opportunities for application of cabot s pigments in high volume  high speed printing 
metal oxides business segment sales and pbt for the metal oxides business for the years ending september   and are as follows dollars in millions segment sales segment pbt in fiscal year  sales in the metal oxides business increased from fiscal year this increase was due primarily to higher volumes million and the positive impact of foreign currency translation million partially offset by a negative price mix million

the metal oxides business segment pbt decreased from fiscal year to fiscal year the decrease in pbt was due principally to a negative price mix million  higher per unit cost of sales resulting from lower operating rates due to inventory drawdowns million and inventory write offs during the year related to off quality material million partially offset by higher volumes million 
in fiscal year  segment pbt increased from fiscal year due principally to higher volumes million and improved price mix million within the fumed metal oxides product line 

table of contents product line sales summary the following table sets forth sales by product line for the metal oxides business for fiscal years  and dollars in millions fumed metal oxides aerogel total metal oxides sales fumed metal oxides during  the fumed metal oxides product line saw an increase in overall volumes of 
reduced demand from a single customer in the electronics segment was more than offset by higher volumes to other segments  particularly in asia 
this resulted in a negative price mix adversely impacting the profitability of the product line 
the profitability of the fumed metal oxides product line was also negatively impacted by higher energy costs  higher per unit cost of sales due to inventory drawdowns  inventory write offs related to off quality material during the year and increased costs related to the anticipated start up of a new fumed silica facility in jiangxi province  china 
fumed metal oxides had strong volume growth of during due to improved demand in all markets 
this volume growth and improved product mix were the primary contributors to an increase in fumed metal oxides pbt over the results also benefited from cost savings related to our excellence program 
aerogels during fiscal year  the aerogels product line continued to make progress in increasing its ability to operate the plant at higher rates as well as in marketing its products for translucent panels in architectural applications 
the product line continued to invest in application and market development activities focused on other potential commercial markets during outlook for looking forward  we anticipate continued slowing of demand in the microelectronics market of the fumed metal oxides product line as well as the associated negative price mix 
we remain optimistic about continued growth in other markets of the product line to support the new capacity coming online in jiangxi province  china 
during the first quarter of fiscal  an incident occurred at a third party industrial gas manufacturing facility co located at our tuscola site that could limit production capacity at our tuscola plant for several months 
we are working to operate this plant at full capacity with alternate supplies of industrial gas and  to the extent available  will use our existing finished product inventory and our other manufacturing facilities to supply our customers 
however  if alternative supplies are not available  our tuscola facility may operate at a reduced capacity until supply from the third party is restored 
we continue to work on manufacturing capabilities and market development in the aerogels product line and remain hopeful that we will see progress in the growth of this business in 
table of contents supermetals business segment sales and pbt for the supermetals business for the years ending september   and are as follows dollars in millions segment sales segment pbt in the supermetals business  sales increased from fiscal year to fiscal year this increase was driven by increased volumes million partially offset by lower prices million 
during fiscal year  sales decreased from due to lower volumes million and prices million partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency translation million 
the supermetals business pbt decreased from fiscal year to  before the goodwill and long lived asset impairment and million of cost reduction initiatives recorded in this decrease was due primarily to lower pricing million  higher per unit cost of sales resulting from lower operating rates million and incremental costs from the labor situation at our boyertown  pennsylvania facility million partially offset by higher volumes million 
in fiscal year  segment pbt decreased from this decrease was primarily due to lower volumes million and lower prices million partially offset by lower variable cost million and reductions in operating costs related to the excellence program million 
in  segment sales and segment pbt were both negatively impacted by the absence of intermediate semi finished product sales and a greater portion of tantalum powder sales being at market prices rather than at fixed contract prices 
the business was able to partially offset these impacts with additional market based sales 
as a result  while total tantalum volumes including semi finished products decreased by compared to  finished product tantalum volumes increased by year over year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company reached agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement with the local c of the international chemical workers union council united food and chemical workers that settled the labor dispute that began in june during the second quarter of fiscal year  management determined  based on a combination of factors associated with the anticipated future performance of the supermetals business  that the long lived assets including goodwill of this business may not be recoverable and thus an impairment analysis was performed 
these factors included the continuing trend toward the use of smaller tantalum capacitors in electronics devices  resulting in significantly less tantalum powder being required for each capacitor  the continued high inventory levels in the supply chain and the expected decrease in tantalum powder sales volume and pricing as the business continues to transition to market based volumes and pricing over the next two years 
the impairment analysis indicated that the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the business were sufficient to recover the carrying value of the long lived assets over their remaining useful lives 
however  based on the estimated discounted cash flows of the business  it was determined that the fair value of this reporting unit was below its carrying amount and that a full impairment of the goodwill existed 
accordingly  we were required to write off the entire million goodwill balance of the reporting unit during the second quarter of fiscal since that time  particularly during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  events occurred that required management to re evaluate the anticipated future performance of the supermetals business 
these events included the decision by management in august to exit the manufacture and sale of finished tantalum sputtering targets  which was previously forecasted to be an important contributor to the future cash flows of the business  and the increased likelihood of higher tantalum ore costs under our purchase commitments with sons of gwalia 
these factors  combined with significantly lower market prices for tantalum powder than anticipated when the impairment analysis was performed in the second quarter  led management to believe that the business s remaining long lived assets  after the goodwill write off  may not be recoverable  and that 
table of contents a further impairment analysis was necessary 
in this analysis  the carrying amount of the business s long lived assets consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment was compared to the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from our use of the assets over their remaining useful lives 
this comparison indicated that the carrying value of the long lived assets was in excess of their undiscounted cash flows and  therefore  an impairment existed 
the company  with the assistance of independent valuation specialists  determined the fair value of the business s long lived assets using estimated discounted cash flows that we believe would be forecasted by a purchaser of the business 
since this analysis indicated that a full write down of the long lived assets was warranted  and to ensure that individual assets were not written down below their fair market value  we engaged independent valuation specialists to perform appraisals of individual assets 
the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair market value resulted in a million charge that was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  the supermetals business also recorded a charge of million associated with on going cost reduction initiatives in that business 
these charges included million of asset write downs associated with management s decision to stop manufacturing and selling finished tantalum sputtering targets to the semiconductor industry and to instead focus on the sale of tantalum plate and ingot to sputtering target manufacturers  as well as million of charges related to severance and million of charges related to the write down of assets related to abandoned research and development projects 
outlook for looking forward  we remain cautious regarding the performance of supermetals as the business transitions from its fixed price and fixed volume contracts over the next two calendar years 
in addition  the price at which we are required to purchase ore from the sons of gwalia commencing in january remains uncertain 
the determination of that price is currently the subject of an arbitration between us and the sons of gwalia 
there are a number of matters in dispute between the parties in the arbitration  and the arbitrator could find in favor of cabot on certain of these matters while finding in favor of the sons of gwalia on others 
however  if the arbitrator finds fully in favor of the sons of gwalia on all matters in dispute  we would be obligated to buy tantalum ore under our extended contract at prices that could increase our annual ore costs by approximately million in calendar year if the arbitrator finds fully in cabot s favor on all matters in dispute in the arbitration  our calendar year ore costs could decrease by approximately million 
for contract years after  the price payable may be subject to a number of factors and it is  therefore  difficult to project a range of difference for future periods 
we also continue to negotiate a commercial resolution to the dispute 
if the parties do not resolve this matter through a negotiated settlement  we expect a final arbitrated decision to be issued during the first quarter of calendar year based on the range of difference in our position and sons of gwalia s position  as well as the negotiations to date between us  we believe it is more likely than not that we will incur ore costs under the extended contract that are higher than our current costs  which higher costs could have a material adverse effect on this business s results 
in light of the transition from fixed price and fixed volume contracts and the ore situation  we are continuing to reduce costs in the supermetals business to improve our competitive position 
specialty fluids business segment sales and pbt for the specialty fluids business for the years ending september   and are as follows dollars in millions segment sales segment pbt sales in the specialty fluids business increased in fiscal year when compared to driven mainly by an increase in the number of customers  an increase in the number of on going and completed jobs during the year and an increase in the average amount of fluid utilized per job 
the average number of 
table of contents barrels of cesium fluid used per job increased from fiscal year to fiscal year in fiscal year  sales increased due to an increase in the volume of fluid being used 
the pbt for this business increased million in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year  due primarily to increased fluid utilization  both in total and on a per job basis 
this was partly the result of two new customers using cesium fluid during the year and the start of the first large job in the gulf of mexico 
additionally  more jobs were completed in fiscal year than in fiscal year and higher prices for fluid not returned contributed to the increase in pbt 
segment pbt increased in fiscal year due to an increase in the number of jobs completed when compared to fiscal year the business completed twenty six  fifteen and twelve jobs in fiscal years  and  respectively 
outlook for looking forward  we remain optimistic about continued growth in this business during fiscal year we continue to work on market development activities outside of the north sea particularly in the gulf of mexico  the caspian sea and the middle east 
cash flow and liquidity our cash balance increased by million in  from million on september  to million on september  during  the cash balance declined by million  from million on september  and in our cash balance increased by million  from million on september  the following descriptions of the reasons for these changes in our cash balances refer to the various sections of our consolidated statements of cash flows  which appears in item of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september  cash generated from operating activities  which consists of net income loss adjusted for various non cash items included in income  changes in working capital and changes in certain other balance sheet accounts  decreased to million in from million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the decline in cash generated from operating activities in was due to a decrease in net income of million and an increase in cash used for other liabilities of which million primarily relates to pension liabilities 
these changes were partly offset by a change in asset impairment charges and tax benefits of million 
the working capital consumption was primarily due to increases in receivable balances related to both higher selling prices in the carbon black business as well as longer payment terms for certain customers in the supermetals business 
in addition  inventory increased during the year primarily as a result of increased raw material costs in the carbon black business 
changes in cash generated from operating activities in from were principally due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances caused by higher sales and strong market conditions

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the chinese government revalued the chinese renminbi  thus eliminating the fixed translation to the us dollar 
we have reviewed the effect of this revaluation with regards to the increasing growth in our carbon black and metal oxide businesses in china 
during that same quarter  the malaysian government revalued the malaysian ringgit by eliminating its fixed translation to the us dollar 
although we do not anticipate that the current revaluations will have a material impact on our operations and results  as with any fluctuating currency  any significant fluctuations could materially impact our results 
we are not involved in any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources

the supermetals business purchases a significant portion of its raw material under long term supply contracts with the sons of gwalia that were due to expire in in august  cabot exercised its option to renew one of the supply contracts commencing on january  for a period of five years 
the price at which the raw materials will be purchased under the contract extension is the subject of an arbitration proceeding 
accordingly  because the specific price at which the company will purchase tantalum ore from the sons of gwalia remains unknown  the table above includes commitments based on current prices 
however  depending on the outcome of the dispute with the sons of gwalia  our actual purchase prices could be higher than reflected above 
see note t of the consolidated financial statements 
long term debt and fixed interest at september   our long term debt totaled million  which matures over a period of twenty two years

operating leases we have operating leases primarily comprised of leases for transportation vehicles  warehouse facilities  office space  and machinery and equipment 
restructuring in october  we initiated a plan to shut down our altona  australia carbon black manufacturing facility due to our raw materials supplier s indication that it would cease supply in september  as well as the decline of the carbon black business in australia 
production at this facility ceased on october  as of september   we expect the restructuring initiatives to result in a pre tax charge to earnings of approximately million

for those significant foreign plans  the fair value of assets was approximately million below the projected benefit obligation 
we contributed an aggregate amount of million in to the foreign plans and expect to contribute approximately million in to those plans 
contributions to foreign plans are made in foreign currencies and  therefore  are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have assets of million at september  that we have designated to fund pension obligations for a foreign plan 
these assets are not included in the pension plan assets as of september  these assets do not qualify as plan assets under fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  because they are not specifically segregated or restricted for use to fund the defined benefit plan obligation  and  accordingly  the assets are not shown in the funded status at september  cabot made a discretionary contribution of million in fiscal to fund benefit payments under the us defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan  serp 
we routinely review the funding status of the defined benefit plans to determine when a contribution will improve the overall position of the plan and as a result we expect to make a million contribution to fund benefit payments under the serp in fiscal postretirement benefit plans at september   the unfunded postretirement benefit plans are comprised of the following us foreign total dollars in millions fair value of plan assets at september  projected benefit obligation at september  underfunded status at september  cabot s postretirement benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
typical of such plans  the cabot postretirement plans are unfunded 
costs associated with these plans are recorded as expense in the statement of operations when claims or insurance premiums come due 
in the us  cabot has capped its retiree medical costs to an average amount per retiree  to limit the company s financial responsibility for the cost of providing medical coverage to retirees and to mitigate the risk of potential escalation in costs borne by cabot for retiree medical coverage

fas r requires companies to recognize  as an operating expense  the estimated fair value of share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans 
the expense will be based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
the standard provides for three alternative transition methods including i a modified prospective application mpa  without restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption  ii mpa with restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption and iii a modified retrospective application 
the company has chosen to use the mpa transition method without restatement of prior interim periods and continues to evaluate the expected impact to the consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb delayed implementation of fas r 
it became effective for the company on october  in november  fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter fas to improve financial reporting and global comparability of inventory accounting 
the amendment  which adopted language similar to that used in the international accounting standards board s iasb international accounting standard ias  clarifies that inventory related expenses  such as abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted or spoiled materials should be recognized as current period charges 
the statement also requires fixed production overhead allocations to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning october  the adoption of fas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income 
cabot is both an exporter and a domestic manufacturer 
the company s loss of the export incentive tax benefit is expected to materially exceed the tax benefit it should receive from the domestic manufacturing deduction 
the ajca also allows us companies to repatriate up to million of earnings from their foreign subsidiaries in or at an effective tax rate of 
the company does not expect to take advantage of this opportunity  nor does it expect that there is a material benefit available  given our particular circumstances and the various requirements under the law 
the company  however  will continue to study the impact and opportunities of the ajca  as additional guidance becomes available from the irs 
in response  the fasb has issued staff position fsp no 
and  which outline accounting treatment for the impacts of ajca 
the fsps state that i any benefit that companies may have from the domestic manufacturing deduction be treated as a special deduction and accordingly any benefit would be reported in the year in which the income is earned and ii regarding the impact resulting from the repatriation of unremitted earnings in the period in which the enacted tax law was passed  companies may wait until they have the information necessary to determine the amount of the earnings they intend to repatriate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management market risk our principal financial risk management objective is to identify and monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates  in order to assess the impact that changes in each could have on 
table of contents future cash flow and earnings 
we manage these risks through normal operating and financial activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments as well as foreign currency debt 
certain information related to our market risk is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item below 
our financial risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all instruments entered into by cabot are reviewed and approved by cabot s financial risk management committee  an internal management committee charged with enforcing cabot s financial risk management policy 
by using derivative instruments  we are subject to credit and market risk 
if a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract  our credit risk will equal the fair value of the derivative 
generally  when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes cabot  thus creating a repayment risk for cabot 
we minimize the credit or repayment risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with highly rated counterparties that are reviewed periodically by us 
interest rates as of september   we had debt totaling million and interest rate swaps with a notional value of million 
the interest rate swaps were entered into as a hedge of the underlying debt instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the debt instrument 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
japanese yen interest rate swaps we use both yen based debt and cross currency swaps to hedge our net investment in japanese subsidiaries against adverse movements in exchange rates 
we have a billion japanese yen million debt outstanding  which is borrowed against our million revolving line of credit  which expires in august of the remaining availability under the revolving credit facility as of september  is million  which includes a letter of credit draw down of less than million 
we entered into two interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion yen million 
the swaps are variable for fixed rate swaps with semi annual interest payments and mature in fiscal the swaps are derivative instruments as defined by fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and have been designated as cash flow hedges 
these swaps hedge the variability of the cash flows caused by changes in yen libor interest rates 
changes in the value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income  while the ineffective portion is reported in earnings 
the swaps had positive fair values assets of less than million on september  and  respectively  and are included in other assets 
there was no charge to earnings for either of the periods ending september  or within the next twelve months  we expect to reclassify million of gains from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings 
japanese yen cross currency swaps we have two cross currency swaps  which in total swapped million us dollar at three month us libor interest rates for billion japanese yen at three month yen libor interest rates 
we receive interest payments on million at three month us dollar libor interest rates and make interest payments on billion japanese yen at three month japanese yen libor interest rates 
the cross currency swaps reduce cabot s interest rate by on the notional amount of million as of september  given rates in force as of that date 
during fiscal  we extended the maturity date of these swaps to october included in other liabilities at september  and is million and million  respectively  related to the fair value of the cross currency swaps 
the change in fair value of the cross currency swaps of million for the twelve months ending september  has been recorded as a foreign currency translation gain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  offsetting foreign currency translation adjustments of cabot s yen denominated net investments 
the effectiveness of these hedges is based on changes in the spot foreign exchange rates and the balance of cabot s yen denominated net investments 
the amount of net losses recorded in earnings for the period related to the ineffectiveness of the hedges was nominal 

table of contents japanese net investment hedge the billion japanese yen debt of million and million  respectively  has been designated as a net investment hedge under fas no 
at september  and  zero and million  respectively was included as a charge to cumulative translation adjustment with a corresponding amount in other liabilities related to the revaluation of the debt from yen to us dollar 
medium term notes interest rate swaps we have outstanding two fixed to variable interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the swaps have been designated as fair value hedges 
the interest rate swaps and the related medium term notes mature on various dates through february the positive fair values assets of the derivative instruments were less than million and million at september  and  respectively  and have been recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding increase to long term debt 
the interest rate swaps were determined to be highly effective and no amount of ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings during the period ended september  and as of september  and  after adjusting for the effect of the interest rate swap agreements  we have fixed rate debt of million and million  respectively  and floating rate debt of million  in both years 
holding other variables constant such as exchange rates and debt levels  a basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million and million on september  and  respectively 
the earnings and cash flow impact in resulting from a basis point increase in short term interest rates would be approximately million  holding all other variables constant 
a basis point increase in global interest rates would increase the derivative instruments fair value by million at september  compared to a million decrease at september  any increase or decrease in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset  liability  or cash flow 
as of september   we had million in cash and million in readily available cash investments 
in order of priority  it is our policy to invest excess cash in instruments that will protect principal  ensure liquidity and optimize the rate of return 
interest income earned may vary as a result of changes in interest rates and average cash balances  which could fluctuate over time 
foreign currency cabot s international operations are subject to certain risks  including currency fluctuations and government actions 
our treasury function  under the guidance of the financial risk management committee  continuously monitors foreign exchange exposures  so that we can respond to changing economic and political environments 
exposures primarily relate to assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as well as the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows generated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we use short term forward contracts to minimize the exposure to foreign currency risk 
in   and  none of cabot s forward contracts were designated as hedging instruments under fas no 
cabot s forward foreign exchange contracts are denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar and indonesian rupiah 
as part of a million bond issuance  a cabot subsidiary entered into a ten year contract with a notional amount of million to swap us dollars to euros 
this cross currency swap has been designated as a foreign currency cash flow hedge 
this swap hedges the variability of the cash flows on million or of the debt issuance  for changes in the exchange rates over the life of the debt instrument 
changes in the value of the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in other comprehensive income  while the ineffective portion is reported in earnings 
this swap had negative fair values liabilities of million and million on september  and  respectively  and is included in other liabilities 
there was no charge to earnings for the years ended september  and  and we do not expect to reclassify any material gains or losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings within the next twelve months 

table of contents the cabot subsidiary also holds two swaps on the remaining issuance of million or of the bond issuance 
the first is a fixed to floating swap on the fixed rate coupon of to a six month us libor rate plus a spread of basis points 
the variable interest rate on the swap resets with the terms of the bond coupon payments 
this swap has been designated as a fair value hedge and had a nominal fair value on september  and the interest rate swaps were determined to be highly effective and a nominal amount of ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings during the periods ended september  and the second swap is a basis swap on million of the bond issuance which converts us dollars at variable interest rates to euros at variable interest rates 
this swap has not been designated as a fair value hedge under fas the basis swap had a negative fair value liabilities of million and million on september   and  respectively  which is included in other liabilities 
changes in the value of the swap are recognized immediately in earnings  and are offset by the recognition in earnings of the revaluation of the underlying debt 
we recorded less than million of assets and million of liabilities to recognize the fair value of currency instruments at september  and september  a appreciation in the us dollar s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by million and million at september  and  respectively 
a depreciation in the us dollar s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by million and million at september  and  respectively 
any increase or decrease in the fair value of cabot s currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset  liability  or cash flow 
political risk we are exposed to political or country risks inherent in doing business in some countries 
these risks may include actions of governments  importing and exporting issues  contract loss and asset abandonment 
we consider these risks carefully in connection with our investment and operating activities 
share repurchases we repurchase our shares in order to offset dilution caused by issuing shares under our various employee stock plans 
in addition  we may repurchase our shares as one method of returning excess cash to shareholders
