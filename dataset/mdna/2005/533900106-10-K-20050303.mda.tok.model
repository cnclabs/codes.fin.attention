 accounting for stock based compensation  which is considered the preferable accounting method for stock based employee compensation 
all employee stock option grants beginning january  are expensed over the stock option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted 
historically  the company applied the intrinsic value method permitted under sfas no 
 as defined in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  in accounting for the company s stock option plans 
accordingly  no compensation cost was recognized prior to in may  the stock plan was amended by the shareholders to allow for the issuance of tandem appreciation rights tars  deferred shares and restricted shares of the company s common stock 
tars payable in cash require the recording of a liability and related compensation expense to be measured by the difference between the quoted market price of the number of common shares covered by the grant and the option price per common share at grant date 
any increases or decreases in the market price of the common shares between grant date and exercise date result in changes to the company s compensation expense 
compensation expense is accrued over the vesting period 
in addition  changes in the market price of common shares after the vesting period  but prior to the exercise date  require changes in compensation expense

this modification required that the tars be accounted for as equity awards 
the associated liability of million was reclassified from other non current liabilities to additional paid in capital

table of contents product liability expense product liability expenses have been increasing  particularly with respect to the increased number of welding fume claims 
the costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs  which are recognized in the periods incurred 
net expenditures on product liability increased approximately million in these net expenditures are projected to increase by approximately million in compared to see note n 
the long term impact of the welding fume loss contingency in the aggregate on operating cash flows and capital markets access is difficult to assess  particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co defendants and insurance carriers 
moreover  the company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims and indemnity payments have been immaterial 
if cost sharing dissipates for some currently unforeseen reason  or the company s trial experience changes overall  it is possible on a longer term basis that the cost of resolving this loss contingency could reduce the company s operating results and cash flow and restrict capital market access 
off balance sheet financial instruments the company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations 
letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the company s credit agreement 
outstanding letters of credit at december  and were immaterial

the costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs  which are recognized in the periods incurred 
insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and  where reimbursements are probable  they are recognized in the applicable period 
with respect to costs other than defense costs ie  for liability and or settlement or other resolution  reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs  after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience 
if an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable  or if the 
table of contents amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated  disclosure is provided for material claims or litigation 
many of the current cases are in preliminary procedural stages and insufficient information exists upon which judgments can be made as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions 
therefore  in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made at this time 
reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change 
moreover  reserves only cover identified and or asserted claims 
future claims could  therefore  give rise to increases to such reserves 
see note n to the consolidated financial statements and the legal proceedings section of this annual report on form k for further discussion of legal contingencies 
the company is subject to taxation from us federal  state  municipal and international jurisdictions 
the calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment 
the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published 
the company maintains reserves for estimated income tax exposures for many jurisdictions 
exposures are settled primarily through the settlement of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation 
exposures can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for income tax exposures  however  actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries which are deemed permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with the remittance of these earnings 
deferred income taxes of million have been provided on earnings of million that are not expected to be permanently reinvested 
at december  and  the company has approximately million and million respectively  of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carryforwards which will reduce taxable income in future years 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
at december  and  a valuation allowance of million and million respectively  has been recorded against these deferred tax assets based on this assessment 
the company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the company s assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes 
pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plan in the united states 
a significant element in determining the company s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets 
the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets and the market related value of plan assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the market related value of plan assets could be determined by either fair value or a calculated value recognizing changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years 
the method chosen must be applied consistently year to year 
the company used fair values at december for the market related value of plan assets 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets 
this 
table of contents produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the amortization of the net deferral of past losses will increase future pension expense 
during  investment gains in the company s us pension plans were approximately 
in addition  the company made million of voluntary contributions during and approximately million in pension expense relating to the company s defined benefit plans for was approximately million lower than this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million  for the same periods  relating to the company s defined contribution plans 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used for plan liabilities 
to develop the discount rate assumption to be used  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments which match the expected cash flow of future plan obligations 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
inventories and reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
for domestic inventories  cost is determined principally by the last in  first out lifo method  and for non us inventories  cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the valuation of lifo inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time 
the excess of current cost over lifo cost amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company reviews the net realizable value of inventory in detail on an on going basis  with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management  and the company s estimates prove to be inaccurate  write downs of inventory values and adjustments to cost of sales may be required 
historically  the company s reserves have approximated actual experience 
accounts receivable and allowances the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered 
the company estimates this allowance based on knowledge of the financial condition of customers  review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information 
if the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future  additional allowances may be required 
historically  the company s reserves have approximated actual experience 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset  or the appropriate grouping of assets  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions about the company s businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including those portions of this management s discussion and analysis that refer to the future may contain forward looking statements that 
table of contents are not historical facts 
those statements are forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of all such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements  and the company s future performance  operating results  financial position and liquidity  are subject to a variety of factors that could materially affect future results  including competition 
the company operates in a highly competitive global environment and is subject to a variety of competitive factors such as pricing  the actions and strength of its competitors  and the company s ability to maintain its position as a recognized leader in welding technology 
the intensity of foreign competition is substantially affected by fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against other currencies 
the company s competitive position could also be adversely affected should new or emerging entrants become more active in the arc welding business 
economic and market conditions 
the company is subject to general economic  business and industry conditions which can adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s revenues and profits depend significantly on the overall demand for arc welding and cutting products 
capital spending in the manufacturing and other industrial sectors can adversely affect the company s results of operations 
if economic and market conditions deteriorate  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
international markets 
the company s long term strategy is to increase its share in growing international markets  particularly asia  latin america  eastern europe and other developing markets 
however  there can be no certainty that the company will be successful in its expansion efforts 
the company is subject to the currency risks of doing business abroad  and the possible effects of international terrorism and hostilities 
moreover  international expansion poses challenging demands within the company s infrastructure 
cyclicality and maturity of the welding and cutting industry 
the united states arc welding and cutting industry is both mature and cyclical 
the growth of the domestic arc welding and cutting industry has been and continues to be constrained by numerous factors  including the increased cost of steel and the substitution of plastics and other materials in place of fabricated metal parts in many products and structures 
increased offshore production of fabricated steel structures has also decreased the domestic demand for arc welding and cutting products in the company s largest market 
litigation 
the company  like other manufacturers in the us market  is subject to a variety of product liability lawsuits and potential lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business 
while past experience has generally shown these cases to be immaterial  product liability cases in the us against the company  particularly with respect to welding fumes  continue to increase and past experience may not be predictive of the future 
operating factors 
the company is highly dependent on its skilled workforce and efficient production facilities  which could be adversely affected by its labor relations  business interruptions and short term or long term interruptions in the availability of supplies or raw materials or in the transportation of finished goods 
research and development 
the company s continued success depends  in part  on its ability to continue to meet customer welding needs through the introduction of new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics 
there can be no assurances that new products or product improvements  once developed  will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to the operating results of the company  or that product development will continue at a pace to sustain future growth 
raw materials and energy costs 
in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk and price fluctuations related to the purchase of commodities primarily steel and energy used in the manufacture of its products 
the company s market risk strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for products and services as dictated by supply and demand 
in addition  the company uses various hedging arrangements to manage exposures to price risk from commodity and energy purchases  though there is no effective and available hedging technique for steel 
the company s results of operations may be 
table of contents adversely affected by shortages of supply 
the company s results of operations may also be negatively affected by increases in prices to the extent these increases can not be passed on to customers 
the above list of factors that could materially affect the company s future results is not all inclusive 
any forward looking statements reflect only the beliefs of the company or its management at the time the statement is made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary financial market risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
the company manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during the years ended december  and  the principal transactions hedged were intercompany loans and intercompany purchases 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions 
at december   the company had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of approximately million which hedged intercompany loans  recorded balance sheet exposures  and future intercompany third party sales and purchases in non local currencies 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates on the company s open foreign exchange contracts at december  would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
from time to time  the company uses various hedging arrangements to manage exposures to price risk from commodity and energy purchases 
the primary commodities hedged are aluminum  copper and natural gas 
these hedging arrangements have the effect of locking in for specified periods at predetermined prices or ranges of prices the prices the company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in commodity prices on the company s open commodity futures at december   would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
the fair value of the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december   approximated carrying value due to their short term duration 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for the issues contained in the investment portfolio and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
these financial instruments are also subject to concentrations of credit risk 
the company has minimized this risk by entering into arrangements with major banks and financial institutions and investing in several high quality instruments 
the company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
the company uses floating rate swaps to convert a portion of its million fixed rate  long term borrowings into short term variable interest rates 
the company uses the short cut method to account for these swaps as prescribed in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities 
a hypothetical decrease of in the floating rate would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
see discussion in liquidity long term debt 
at december   the fair value of amounts due banks approximated the carrying values due to its short term maturities 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the company s weighted average short term borrowing rate at december   and was not materially different from the year end carrying value
