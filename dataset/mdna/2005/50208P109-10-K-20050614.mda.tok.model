item legal proceedings on july  we filed suit in the us district court for the district of delaware against four companies who provide equipment  systems and services that convert paper checks presented at the point of sale into electronic transactions 
in the suit  we allege that these four companies infringe three of our us patents 
we are seeking damages and injunctive and other relief for the alleged willful infringement of these patents 
a federal judge has set a trial date of april  in this matter 
during the quarter ended december   one of the defendants filed a counterclaim for declaratory relief 
the defendant is seeking a declaratory judgment that each of the patents in suit is invalid  unenforceable  not infringed by the defendant and that the court determine that this is an extraordinary and exceptional case and award the defendant it s attorney s fees and litigation expenses 
we believe that this counterclaim is without merit and we do not expect it to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
we are involved in a dispute with a former consultant relating to the payment of finders fees with respect to certain acquisitions we made in the fiscal years ended march  and march  in october we initiated arbitration proceedings pursuant to the terms of the finder s fee agreement between us and the former consultant the finder s fee agreement 
in june the former consultant filed a counter claim in the arbitration proceedings alleging we breached the finder s fee agreement 
at this time we do not expect the resolution of this dispute to have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  financial position or liquidity 
other than as described herein  we are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings 
however  we are party from time to time to additional ordinary litigation incidental to our business  none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  financial position or liquidity

dividend policy we have not paid any dividends on our common stock in the past and have no current plan to pay dividends in the future 
we intend to devote all funds to the operation of our businesses 
canadian federal tax considerations general there are no foreign or currency controls in canada  and there are no exchange restrictions on borrowing from abroad  on the repatriation of capital  or the ability to remit dividends  profits  interests  royalties  or other payments to non resident holders of our common stock 
however  any such remittance to a resident of the us is subject to a reduced withholding tax pursuant to various articles of the canada us income tax convention  the treaty between canada and the us dividends generally  dividends that are paid or credited by canadian corporations to non resident shareholders are subject to a nonresident tax of 
however  the treaty provides that dividends paid by a canadian corporation to a corporation resident of the us with no permanent establishment in canada  which owns at least of our voting stock paying the dividend  are subject to the canadian non resident withholding tax of 
in all other cases  when a dividend is paid by a canadian corporation to the beneficial owner resident in the us  the canadian non resident withholding tax is of the amount of the dividend 
the reduced withholding tax rates do not apply if the beneficial owner of the shares carries on business through a permanent establishment in canada and the stock holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment 
in such a case  the dividends are taxable in canada as general business profits at rates that may exceed the or rates applicable to dividends that are not effectively connected with a canadian permanent establishment 
the treaty permits canada to apply its domestic law rules for differentiating dividends from interest and other disbursements 
stock dividends are subject to the normal canadian non resident withholding tax rules on the amount of the dividend 
the amount of a stock dividend is equal to the increase in our paid up capital by virtue of the dividend 
interest generally  interest paid or credited to a non resident is subject to a canadian withholding tax 
if  at a time when interest has accrued but is not yet payable  the holder of the debt transfers it to a canadian resident or  in certain circumstances  a non resident who carries on business in canada  part of the proceeds of the disposition may be considered to be interest for canadian income tax purposes 
under the treaty  the rate of withholding tax on interest paid to a us resident is 
for treaty purposes  interest means interest as defined by domestic canadian income tax rules 
the withholding tax applies to the gross amount of the interest payment 
capital gains non residents are subject to canadian income tax on dispositions of taxable canadian property 
taxable canadian property includes shares of a publicly traded canadian corporation if  at any time during the preceding five years  the non resident and persons with whom the non resident did not deal at arm s length owned at least of the issued and outstanding shares of any class of stock 
the applicable tax rate on capital gains realized by a non resident is for corporations and for individuals 
under the treaty  capital gains realized by a us resident on the disposition of shares of a canadian corporation are exempt from canadian income tax  unless i the value of the shares is derived principally from canadian real property  or ii the shares are effectively connected with a permanent canadian establishment of such non resident  the capital gains are attributable to such permanent establishment  and the gains are realized not later than twelve months after the termination of such permanent establishment

overview lml payment systems inc is a financial payment processor 
we provide check risk services such as electronic check authorization  electronic check processing services such as electronic check conversion and return check management such as traditional and electronic recovery services to retail clients 
we also provide mainframe payment processing software modules and rights to use our patented intellectual property to retailers and other payment processors 
when we provide return check management services  we typically receive revenue when we are successful at recovering the principal amount of the original transaction on behalf of the client 
in some instances we also earn a percentage of the principal amount and in some other instances our secondary recovery services provide for us to earn additional fees when legal action is required 
when we provide check authorization and electronic check conversion services we typically earn revenue based upon the number of transactions we process through our data center 
due to their interrelated nature  we often bundle check authorization  check processing and check recovery services into combined service packages and market these packages under our lasr brand name live authorization settlement and recovery 
when we provide mainframe based payment software modules to clients who are of sufficient size and possess the technical capability to process financial transactions in house  or through their own data center  we typically earn revenue by way of a fixed software license fee 
in some instances we also earn revenue by way of royalties that are typically based upon a fixed sale price or on a usage or transaction basis 
when we provide licenses to our intellectual property estate which includes four us patents describing electronic check processing methods  we typically earn revenue from release fees for potential past infringement and ongoing royalty fees 
we provide our financial payment processing services from our office locations in scottsdale  arizona  wichita  kansas and dallas  texas 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue total revenue for fiscal year was approximately million  approximately a decrease over total revenue of approximately million for fiscal year this decrease is partially attributable to a decrease in revenue related to the licensing of our intellectual property estate and partially attributable to a decrease in revenue associated with our electronic check verification and primary check collections business 
revenue from electronic check verification decreased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the decrease is primarily attributable to us no longer providing electronic check verification services to eleven  formerly our largest customer which was responsible for approximately of revenue from our electronic check verification services for the fiscal year revenue from our primary check collections business decreased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the reduction in revenue from our primary check collections business was primarily attributable to us no longer providing check recovery services to eleven  formerly our largest customer which was responsible for approximately of revenue from our primary check collections business for the fiscal year revenue from our secondary check collections business increased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the increase in revenue from our secondary check collections business was primarily attributable to an increase in collections of the principal amount and related fees of returned checks assigned for secondary recovery 
we ceased providing check authorization and recovery services to eleven  formerly our largest customer  on may  revenue from eleven directly attributable to this contract amounted to approximately in fiscal of our total revenue and represents approximately million or approximately of the total decrease in revenue for the fiscal year versus the fiscal year we believe that replacement revenue may come from sales of our electronic check verification  recovery and electronic check conversion products and services to existing and new merchant clients  the licensing of our patented technology regarding electronic check processing and royalties from software licensing agreements 
failure to successfully replace some or all of this revenue could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
revenue from our licensing of certain payment software modules was approximately  for fiscal year  compared to approximately  for fiscal year revenue from royalties received from checkfree pertaining to their marketing of the pep reach product was approximately  for fiscal year  compared to approximately  for fiscal year we believe future royalties are dependent upon the continued successful marketing by checkfree corporation of the pep reach product 
we believe that the number of electronic check transactions will continue to increase and believe that such increases will provide continued revenue opportunities for us 
according to nacha  accounts receivable check conversion  referred to by many as arc  grew last year to over billion transactions 
we believe that the potential for the arc market is much larger than current processing levels 
our partnership with checkfree corporation and their marketing of the pep reach product to banks  financial institutions and other organizations who currently provide paper lockbox services to clients  represents an important growth opportunity for us 
revenue from licensing our patented intellectual property decreased by approximately  or approximately from approximately  for fiscal year to approximately  for fiscal year this decrease represents approximately of the total decrease in revenue for the fiscal year versus the fiscal year we expect that revenue from licensing our intellectual property may fluctuate significantly from year to year and we cannot give any assurance as to the level of licensing revenue that will be realized in future periods 
we continue to actively seek to license our patent estate and have received various levels of interest from entities regarding licensing arrangements 
our goal is to negotiate long term arrangements based upon favourable financial terms while at the same time preparing to enforce the rights granted to us under our patent estate 
while we have not fully quantified the results of successfully licensing our patent estate  we expect that licensing arrangements would have a significant positive impact upon our future financial performance 
costs of operations costs of operations consist of transaction processing costs  personnel costs  equipment related costs and telecommunication costs 
costs of operations decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease was partially attributable to certain cost reductions  including staff reductions  implemented during the third quarter of fiscal and partially attributable to certain cost reductions associated with us no longer providing check authorization and recovery services to eleven 
for fiscal year  costs of operations as a percentage of revenue increased to approximately compared to approximately for fiscal year costs of operations were approximately million in the first quarter  approximately million in the second quarter  approximately million in the third quarter and approximately million in the fourth quarter 
we continue to seek ways to reduce costs of operations 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of stock based compensation expense  personnel costs  commissions  office facilities  travel  promotional events such as trade shows  seminars and technical conferences  public relations and professional service fees  which include legal fees  audit fees  sec compliance costs and costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million from approximately million for the fiscal year and  respectively  an increase of approximately million or approximately 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately million from approximately  in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal in our prior fiscal year  we adopted new accounting standards that require fair value accounting for all stock options issued effective fiscal the total fair value stock compensation is amortized over the vesting period resulting in a stock based compensation expense 
the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses were also partially attributable to increases in professional fees  including auditing and accounting fees  of approximately  associated with the continuing compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of offset by lower costs associated with the reduction of personnel and reduced general corporate expenses 
amortization and depreciation amortization on intangibles decreased to approximately  for fiscal year from approximately  for fiscal year the decrease in amortization on intangibles is primarily attributable to the non compete agreements originating from previous years acquisitions becoming fully amortized during the fiscal year depreciation expenses relating to our system software and other software decreased to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year depreciation expense for capital assets decreased to approximately  for fiscal year from approximately  for fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to certain capital assets  which were acquired through previous years acquisitions  becoming fully depreciated during fiscal year other expenses income other expenses were approximately  in fiscal year compared to other income of approximately  in fiscal year interest income  net interest expense increased to approximately  in fiscal year compared to approximately  in fiscal year interest income for fiscal year increased to approximately  from approximately  for fiscal year the increase in interest income was primarily attributed to an increase in interest rates from an average of approximately in fiscal year to approximately in fiscal year income taxes we regularly evaluate the realizability of our future tax assets given the nature of our operations and given the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
at this time  we consider it more likely than not that the future tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income 
accordingly  a valuation allowance of has been provided against these future tax assets at march  and loss from continuing operations loss from continuing operations was approximately million for fiscal year and approximately million for fiscal year loss from continuing operations per both basic and diluted shares was approximately for fiscal year  as compared to approximately for fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue total revenue for fiscal year was approximately million  approximately a increase over total revenue of approximately million for fiscal year this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in revenue associated with the licensing of our intellectual property estate and royalties received from checkfree corporation 
revenue from electronic check verification increased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the increase is partially attributable to us providing a full year of check processing services  including electronic check verification  to certain grocery stores in houston  texas and increased rates from some existing clients 
revenue from our primary check collections business decreased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year revenue from our secondary check collections business increased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year we believe the reduction in revenue from our primary check collections business is partially a result of us no longer providing electronic check recovery services for one of our largest customers and partially a result of a decrease in overall returned check volume from our existing customers 
revenue from our licensing of certain payment software modules was approximately  for fiscal year  compared to approximately  for fiscal year the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the software license fee we received from checkfree corporation in the third quarter of fiscal year relating to the checkfree pep reach product an accounts receivable check conversion product 
revenue from royalties received from checkfree pertaining to their marketing of the pep reach product was approximately  for fiscal year  versus nil for fiscal year revenue from licensing our patented intellectual property increased approximately from approximately  for fiscal year to approximately  for fiscal year during the year ended march   we entered into an agreement regarding our intellectual property estate regarding the processing of electronic check transactions with verus 
the agreement involved a fee in exchange for a release regarding potential past infringements of our intellectual property estate by verus 
the agreement also included separate running royalty fees in exchange for a license regarding future electronic check transactions processed by verus 
the fee for a release has been recognized and included in revenue during the year ended march   and the separate running royalty fees are being recognized on a monthly basis 
during the year ended march   we terminated a separate sub license agreement that had been granted to global etelecom inc global during the year ended march  the remaining balance of approximately  of the initial sub license fee paid to us by global  which had been deferred and was being recognized over the term of the agreement with global  was recorded as revenue on the date of termination 
during the year ended march   eleven  our largest customer  informed us that they would not be renewing their contract for check authorization and recovery services with us 
during the past two fiscal years  revenue from eleven directly attributable to this contract amounted to approximately in fiscal and in fiscal of our total revenue 
we ceased providing check authorization and recovery services to eleven on may  we believe that replacement revenue may come from sales of our electronic check verification  recovery and electronic check conversion products and services to existing and new merchant clients  the licensing of our patented technology regarding electronic check processing and royalties from software licensing agreements 
failure to successfully replace some or all of this revenue could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
costs of operations costs of operations consist of transaction processing costs  personnel costs  equipment related costs and telecommunication costs 
costs of operations decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease was partially attributable to certain cost reductions  including staff  implemented during the third quarter of fiscal  which we expect to result in a reduction of our cost of operations by approximately  per year 
for fiscal year  costs of operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to approximately compared to approximately for fiscal year costs of operations were approximately million in the first quarter  approximately million in the second quarter  and approximately million in the third quarter and fourth quarter  respectively 
we continue to seek ways to reduce costs of operations 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of stock based compensation expense  personnel costs  commissions  office facilities  travel  promotional events such as trade shows  seminars and technical conferences and public relations 
sales  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year and approximately million in fiscal year for fiscal year  sales  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were approximately compared to approximately for fiscal year amortization and depreciation amortization on intangibles decreased to approximately  for fiscal year from approximately  for fiscal year the decrease in amortization on intangibles is primarily attributable to the non compete agreements originating from previous years acquisitions becoming fully amortized during the fiscal year depreciation expenses relating to our system software and other software decreased to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year depreciation expense for capital assets decreased to approximately  for fiscal year from approximately  for fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to certain capital assets  which were acquired through previous years acquisitions  becoming fully depreciated during fiscal year other expenses income in fiscal year  we had other income of approximately  compared to other expenses of approximately  in fiscal year other income was attributed to the removal of unsupported outstanding trade receivables and payables 
other expenses in fiscal were mainly attributed to foreign exchange losses from cash and cash equivalents held in canadian currency 
interest income  net interest expense decreased to approximately  in fiscal year from approximately  in fiscal year interest income for fiscal year decreased to approximately  from approximately  for fiscal year the decrease in interest income was primarily attributed to a decrease in interest rates from an average of approximately in fiscal year to approximately in fiscal year income taxes we regularly evaluate the realizability of our future tax assets given the nature of our operations and given the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
at this time  we consider it more likely than not that the future tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income 
accordingly  the future tax asset is reserved in full as of march  and loss from continuing operations loss from continuing operations was approximately million for fiscal year and approximately million for fiscal year loss from continuing operations per both basic and diluted shares was approximately for fiscal year  as compared to approximately for fiscal year discontinued operations during the year ended march   we sold our wildwood estates property  previously reported in a separate business segment  for total gross proceeds of approximately million cash 
we recorded net profit of approximately  which was primarily attributed to a net gain of approximately  from the sale of real property and capital assets offset by a net loss of approximately  from discontinued operations 
the decision to discontinue operations of this business segment resulted from an opportunity to sell the property and consequently remove a business segment that was no longer consistent with our business strategy 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and financial position consisted of approximately million in working capital as of march  compared to million in working capital as of march  the increase in working capital was attributable to cash flows provided by financing activities of continuing operations of approximately million and cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of approximately  offset by cash used in operating activities of continuing operations of approximately  cash flows used in operating activities of continuing operations increased approximately  from approximately  for fiscal year to approximately  for fiscal year the increase in cash flows used in operating activities of continuing operations was primarily attributable to an increase in loss from continuing operations of approximately million  offset by an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to cash used in investing activities of continuing operations of approximately  for fiscal year the increase in cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations during fiscal year was primarily attributable to a maturity of a short term investment of approximately  offset by capital asset expenditures of approximately  cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was approximately million for fiscal year as compared to approximately  for fiscal year the increase in cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations is primarily due to the increase in proceeds from exercise of options of our common stock in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we anticipate the continued use of cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations in fiscal intellectual property litigation can be expensive and we anticipate spending substantial funds in the enforcement of our intellectual property which may include instituting actions against other entities who we believe are infringing our intellectual property 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances should satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in fiscal in light of our strategic objective of acquiring electronic payment volume across all our financial payment processing services and strengthening our position as a financial payment processor  our long term plans may include the potential to strategically acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies and may also include instituting actions against other entities who we believe are infringing our intellectual property 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances and potential cash flows from operations should satisfy our long term cash requirements  however  we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes  either through equity or debt financing  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
contingencies during fiscal  we filed suit in the us district court for the district of delaware against four companies who provide equipment  systems and services that convert paper checks presented at the point of sale into electronic transactions 
in the suit  we are alleging that telecheck services inc  electronic clearing house inc  xpresschex  inc 
and nova information systems inc infringe us patent nos 
  and  we are seeking damages  injunctive and other relief for the alleged willful infringement of these patents 
the suit is scheduled for trial on april  while we intend to continue vigorously prosecuting this suit and intend to aggressively pursue claims against other companies who provide products and services that we believe infringe on our intellectual property  no assurances can be made that we will be successful in this suit or any other claims that we may pursue 
in addition  the cost of prosecuting a claim of infringement against other companies may be substantial and there can be no assurance that we will have the resources necessary to successfully prosecute a patent infringement claim 
the expense we incur in prosecuting patent litigation could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
contractual obligations in fiscal year  we entered into a two year financing arrangement with de lage financial services canada inc for funding a two year software enhancement renewal fee 
in our prior fiscal year  we entered into a three year lease agreement with ibm credit corporation to finance an equipment purchase 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of march  in thousands payments due by total less than year to years to years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in canada and form the basis for the following discussion and analysis of critical accounting policies and estimates 
we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the course of preparing these financial statements 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to the recognition of revenues  valuation of other long lived assets and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
these estimates form the basis of our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions we have used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition transaction processing and service fees are recognized in the period these services are performed 
these services consist of processing our clients electronic check authorization and conversion transactions 
these fees are charged on a per transactions basis and depend upon the contractual agreement with the client 
check recovery fees are recognized in the period when cash is received for the services performed 
these services typically consist of recovering the face amount of the original transaction and a service or collection fee 
we are typically paid the service fee only when we are successful in the recovery of the face amount of the original transaction on behalf of our client 
in cases where our clients are of sufficient size and possess the technical capability to process transactions on their own  we license certain elements of our modules of our electronic payment processing software 
we are typically paid either a fixed license fee that is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition or in some cases a fee per transaction processed by the client whereupon revenue is recognized at the time the transactions are processed  provided the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
license fees regarding the licensing of the technology embodied within our four us patents regarding electronic check processing are recognized in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition sab and further guidance provided by the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica emerging issues committee eic abstract eic and emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
in some instances  our licensees have paid an up front fee to obtain a license  and in such cases the up front fee is treated as deferred revenue and is recognized over the life of the agreement 
in other cases  our licensees have paid a fee for a release regarding potential past infringements of our four us patents and  in such cases  the fee is recognized as revenue when the release is granted and the amount is reasonably determinable 
running royalties earned from electronic check transactions processed by the licensee are recognized on a monthly basis 
valuation of other long lived assets we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amounts of our other long lived assets  primarily our patents and our transactions processing software  equipment and other intangible assets  may warrant revision or may not be recoverable 
when there are indications that such assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we perform an impairment test in accordance with cica section and sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the opinion of management  our long lived assets are appropriately valued as of march  and stock based compensation we issue stock options to our employees and directors under the terms of our stock option plan and our stock incentive plan 
canadian gaap previously provided two alternative methods of accounting for stock options under the terms and conditions we typically issue such options 
alternative one is to estimate the fair value of the stock option on the date of grant and recognize that value as an expense to operations over the stock option s vesting period alternative one 
alternative two is to estimate the fair value of the stock option on the date of grant but only reflect the impact in a pro forma disclosure setting forth compensation expense as if the fair value method was used in the corporation s financial statements and forego adjusting the consolidated statements of operations alternative two 
during the fiscal year  cica released revised transitional provisions for voluntary adoption of alternative one 
these provisions permit a prospective application of the alternative one recognition provisions to accounting for stock options not previously accounted for at fair value  provided we elect to apply the alternative one method to those stock options granted starting for our fiscal year we adopted these transitional provisions during our fiscal year and  therefore  stock options granted during the fiscal years and have been recognized under alternative one and presented as stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
stock options granted in previous fiscal years have continued to be accounted for under the alternative two method with stock based compensation expense reflected in a pro forma disclosure 
stock options granted in future fiscal years will be accounted for under the alternative one method with stock based compensation recognized as an expense to operations over the stock options vesting period 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item a of regulation s k
