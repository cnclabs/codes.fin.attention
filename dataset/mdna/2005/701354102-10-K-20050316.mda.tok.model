item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company believes that the following are the critical accounting policies affecting the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
the company sells its products primarily through retail distribution channels  with limited sales direct to end users through its own website and direct value added resellers 
retail distributors are generally given business terms that allow for the return of unsold inventory 
in addition  the company offers a day money back guarantee on its products 
with regard to sales through a distribution channel where the right to return unsold product exists  the company recognizes revenue on a sell through method utilizing information provided by the distribution channel 
in addition  since the company does not have sufficient history with sales of this nature to establish an estimate of expected returns  it has recorded a return reserve in the amount of of product sales within the day guarantee period 
in addition to the reserve for sales returns  gross revenue is reduced for price protection programs  customer rebates and cooperative marketing expenses deemed to be sales incentives under emerging issues task force  eitf issue  to derive net revenue 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost as determined under the first in  first out method or market net realizable value 
cost includes the acquisition of purchased materials  labor and overhead 
purchased materials inventory consists principally of components and subassemblies 
the company s investment in inventory is maintained to meet anticipated future demand for its product and the buildup of safety stock on single source or long lead time components 
the company has an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions indicate a permanent impairment in the carrying value of inventory  additional write downs may be required to reduce inventory to estimated net realizable value 
the company recorded a million write down of inventory to net realizable value at december  see note to the financial statements 
this write down is included as a separate deduction from gross margin in the accompanying statement of operations 
impairment of long lived assets property and equipment  patents  copyrights and other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit  ranging from three to twenty years 
management of the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets periodically and takes into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate impairment exists 
no impairments of long lived assets have been identified during any of the periods presented 
accounting for stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
for employee stock option grants  no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
if the company applied the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  as amended by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  it would recognize stock based employee compensation of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the significant amount of employee based stock compensation is due to the substantial number of options granted under these plans as well as the factors impacting the fair value calculation  including high price volatility of the company s common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payment fas r which revises fas and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
in addition to revising fas  fas r supersedes apb 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
the provisions of fas r apply to awards that are granted  modified  or settled at the beginning of the interim or annual reporting period that starts after june  the company will adopt fas r effective july  on a modified prospective basis without restatement of prior interim periods 
the company has determined that fas r will have a substantial impact on the financial statements of the company due to its requirement to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation in the company s consolidated statement of operations  thereby decreasing income and earnings per share 
the company is currently evaluating and considering the financial accounting  income tax  and internal control implications of fas r and the effect that the adoption of this statement may have on its future compensation practices and its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
general the company has made significant investments in developing its technologies and products  the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization 
the company has not yet generated revenues sufficient to offset its operating expenses and has used the proceeds from the sale of its equity securities to fund its operations 
the company anticipates increases in revenues from the sale of its wireless technologies and products in  however it does not anticipate that the revenues will be sufficient to offset its operating expenses 
for wireless revenues to offset costs  the company must attract additional oem and other customers and continue to expand its products and technologies  among other things 
the company intends to continue to use its working capital to support future marketing  sales and research and development activities 
no assurance can be given that such expenditures will result in increased sales  new products  or technological advances or that the company has adequate capital to complete its products or gain market acceptance before requiring additional capital 
results of operations for each of the years ended december   and discontinued operations on may   the company completed the sale of certain assets of its video division to thomson 
the operations of the video business unit were classified as net gain loss from discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the business unit were eliminated from ongoing operations 
the prior years operating activities for the video business unit have also been reclassified to net gain loss from discontinued operations in the company s statements of operations 
prior to the sale  essentially all of the company s revenues were generated by its video division 
net gain loss from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and below include the following components net revenues    cost of goods sold and operating expenses    loss from operations    gain on sale of assets  gain loss from discontinued operations    continuing operations revenues revenues for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended december  included a  one time previously deferred royalty payment upon termination of a licensing agreement 
the remaining revenues of the company were generated through sales of wireless consumer products 
the company initiated sales of its wireless products in the fourth quarter of through direct web sales and an e retailer relationship with tigerdirect 
com 
during the third quarter of  the company expanded its product distribution to additional retail outlets 
the company currently has products in approximately retail storefronts 
for the year ended december   tigerdirect 
com accounted for of total net product revenues 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
the company sells its products primarily through retail distribution channels  with limited sales direct to end users through its own website and direct value added resellers 
retail distributors are generally given business terms that allow for the return of unsold inventory 
in addition  the company offers a day money back guarantee on its products 
with regard to sales through a distribution channel where the right to return unsold product exists  the company recognizes revenue on a sell through method utilizing information provided by the distribution channel 
at december   and  the company has deferred revenue from product sales in the distribution channel of  and  respectively 
in addition  since the company does not have sufficient history with sales of this nature to establish an estimate of expected returns  it has recorded a return reserve in the amount of of product sales within the day guarantee period 
revenues for the period ended december   and are net of an allowance for sales returns of   and  respectively 
in addition to the reserve for sales returns  gross revenue is reduced for price protection programs  customer rebates and cooperative marketing costs deemed to be sales incentives under emerging issues task force  eitf issue  to derive net revenue 
for the years ended december   and  net revenue was reduced for cooperative marketing costs in the amount of   and  respectively 
the company s ability to increase wireless product revenues will largely depend upon the rate at which the company is able to secure additional distribution channels  increase brand recognition and customer demand for its products and sufficiently increase production volumes to meet such demand 
the company s longer term strategy includes the sale of chips  chipsets and or modules to oem customers for integration into their products 
to date the company has generated no revenue from oem channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its current level of revenues on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
gross margin the gross margins for products and royalties for the years ended december were as follows products   royalties  total   the margin recognized on royalty revenues was due to the recognition of a one time  previously deferred prepaid royalty in connection with the termination of the related licensing agreement 
the company s product margin in reflects a write down of inventory to net realizable value in the amount of  this write down was triggered by a significant price decrease on the company s b wireless networking product line in the fourth quarter of  along with the high carrying costs of initial production inventory 
the company reduced the suggested retail price of its wireless router product by and it other wireless networking products by in the fourth quarter of in order to bring its pricing more in line with competitors 
as a result  the carrying value of the company s inventory exceeded its net realizable value after deduction of estimated costs to complete and dispose of the inventory 
product margins for compared to also reflect the impact of increases in the company s provision for obsolete inventory that is included in cost of goods sold as well as increases in direct channel marketing costs that are classified as a reduction in revenue 
the company believes its next generation g wireless networking products will be produced at significantly lower manufactured cost than its current product line 
however until introduction and sell through of these new products  expected late in the second quarter of  the company will continue to sell its b products at a price approximately equal to the carrying value of the inventory 
as a result  the company does not anticipate generating positive margin dollars on its product sales until introduction of its next generation products 
gross margin may be negatively impacted in future periods by many factors  including fluctuating component costs  start up costs associated with new product introductions  sales price reductions on products  and channel marketing costs which are netted against revenue 
in addition  to the extent that the company is unable to increase sales volume of its products  additional write downs of inventory may result 
research and development expenses the company s research and development expenses decreased by  or  from  to  in the company s research and development expenses increased by approximately  or  from  in to  in the decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to the company s ability to obtain  through third parties  certain technologies previously being developed internally by the company 
this resulted in a reduction in wireless engineering staff late in the third quarter of  as well as a reduction in certain third party development fees 
in addition  the company s wireless prototype foundry expenses decreased from to  largely due to timing of prototype foundry runs and related foundry costs 
these decreases were somewhat offset by an increase in amortization expense due to increases in patent costs and intangible research and development assets 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was due to an increase in third party development fees and increased wireless prototype chip development expenses including foundry costs and amortization of prepaid licenses fees 
these increases were somewhat offset by decreases in facilities cost and recurring software maintenance costs 
the company made reductions in its wireless engineering staffing late in the third quarter of due to severance costs and the timing of staff reductions  the full benefits of these reductions were not evident through decreases in research and development expenses until the markets for the company s products and technologies are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the company s ability to successfully develop and introduce  on a timely basis  new and enhanced products and technologies will be a significant factor in the company s ability to grow and remain competitive 
although the percentage of revenues invested by the company may vary from period to period  the company is committed to investing in its research and development programs 
the company anticipates it will use a substantial portion of its working capital for research and development activities in marketing and selling expenses marketing and selling expenses increased by  or  from  in to  in marketing and selling expenses increased by  or from  in to  in the increase in marketing and selling expenses from to were primarily due to increases in advertising and retail market launch expenses to promote the company s products and also the addition of marketing and customer support personnel 
the company anticipates marketing and selling expenses to increase in relation to increases in future sales and revenues 
the increase in marketing and selling expenses from to is primarily due to an increase in the company s marketing efforts reflected by increased third party consulting fees  advertising and travel expenses 
the company is committed to continuing its investment in marketing and selling efforts in order to continue to increase market awareness and penetration of its products  and anticipates further increases in sales and marketing expenses in to support the company s commercialization of its dd products 
general and administrative expenses the company s general and administrative expenses increased by  or  from  in to  in the company s general and administrative expenses increased by  or  from  in to  in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive and administrative personnel costs  insurance costs and costs incurred for outside professional services 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from to is primarily due to increases in corporate outside professional fees and personnel costs  offset somewhat by decreases in corporate insurance costs 
the increase in professional fees incurred is due to fees from outside consultants and the company s external auditors in conjunction with the internal control evaluation as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of the increase in general and administrative expenses from to is primarily due to increases in insurance costs and professional fees  including amortization of prepaid services 
other expense other expense consists of losses on the disposal or sale of fixed assets no longer in service 
for  the loss of  is due to the sale of an interest in an aircraft 
interest and other income interest and other income represents interest earned on the company s investment of the proceeds from sales of its equity securities and net gains on the sale and or maturity of investments 
interest and other income was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease of  from to is due to the use of funds to support operations and a decline in interest rates due to a change in the mix of the company s investment portfolio 
the decrease of  from to is due to declining interest rates and the use of funds to support operations  offset somewhat by net gains recognized on the sale of investments 
loss and loss per common share the company s net loss decreased from  or per common share in to  or per share in  representing a net loss decrease of  or per common share 
the company s net loss increased from  or per common share in to  or per share in  representing a net loss increase of approximately  or 
per common share 
the results of operations are as follows loss from continuing operations    gain loss from discontinued operations    net loss    the million decrease in net loss from to is primarily due to the net gain on the sale of the video business unit assets and decreased research and development expenses 
the million increase from to is due to increased research and development expenses from continuing operations and increased operating losses from discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had working capital of approximately  including approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company used cash for operating activities of approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in cash used for operating activities from to was approximately  this increase was primarily due to purchases of inventory components for initial production of wireless networking products and increases in selling  general and administrative expenses from to the company s accounts payable and accrued expenses  in aggregate  increased from  at december  to  at december  this increase of approximately  is primarily due to accrued channel marketing costs  timing of payments on accounts payable and an increase in wages payable as a result of a change in the company s vacation policy and certain executive bonus accruals at december  the increase in cash used for operating activities from to was approximately  this increase is due to the increase in net loss and changes in accounts payable  offset somewhat by changes in accounts receivable 
the company generated cash from investing activities of approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the cash generated for is primarily from the proceeds of the sale of the video business unit assets and maturity of investments  offset somewhat by payment for patent costs and other intangible assets 
the generation of cash for and was primarily from the maturity and sale of investments  net of purchases  and the payment for intangible assets and capital expenditures 
the company incurred approximately  in in connection with patent costs and the purchase of other intangible assets for use in future products 
the company incurred approximately  and  in connection with patent costs primarily related to the company s wireless technology in and  respectively 
the company incurred approximately   and  for capital expenditures in   and  respectively 
these capital expenditures primarily represent the purchase of certain research and development software and test equipment  manufacturing equipment  marketing and sales demonstration equipment and computer and office equipment to support additional personnel 
at december   the company was not subject to any significant commitments to make additional capital expenditures 
the company generated no cash from financing activities for the year ended december  the company generated cash from financing activities of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cash generated from financing activities represents proceeds from the exercise of stock options in both years and proceeds from the issuance of common stock in to institutional and other investors in private placement transactions exempt from registration under the securities act of the company s future business plans call for continued investment in sales  marketing and product development for its wireless products 
the company s ability to increase wireless product revenues will largely depend upon the rate at which the company is able to secure additional distribution channels  to increase brand recognition and customer demand for its products  and to sufficiently increase production volumes to meet demand 
the overall revenues for will not be sufficient to cover the operational expenses of the company for this fiscal year 
although the company anticipates sales growth in  it does not expect that sales revenues will fully offset the expenses of operations 
the expected continued losses and negative cash flow will continue to be funded by the use of its available working capital 
on march   parkervision received net proceeds of million from the sale of equity securities in a private placement transaction 
the company plans to use these proceeds  together with the million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   to fund its future business plans 
the company believes that its current capital resources together with the proceeds of the march equity financing will be sufficient to support the company s liquidity requirements at least through december  the long term continuation of the company s business plans is dependent upon generation of sufficient revenues from its products to offset expenses 
in the event that the company does not generate sufficient revenues  it will be required to obtain additional funding through public or private financing and or reduce certain discretionary spending 
management believes certain operating costs could be reduced if working capital decreases significantly and additional funding is not available 
in addition  the company currently has no outstanding long term debt obligations 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital and or reduce certain discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to achieve its intended long term business objectives 
the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  were as follows payments due by period year after contractual obligations total or less years years years operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations   commercial commitments risk factors affecting future results in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors set forth below  actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
we have had a history of losses which may ultimately compromise our ability to implement our business plan and continue in operations 
we have had losses in each year since our inception in  and continue to have an accumulated deficit 
the net loss for was million 
to date  our products have not produced revenues sufficient to cover operating  research and development and overhead costs 
we also will continue to make expenditures on research and development and on pursuing patent protection for our intellectual property 
we expect that our revenues in the near term will not bring the company to profitability 
if we are not able to generate sufficient revenues  and we have insufficient capital resources  we will not be able to implement our business plan and investors will suffer a loss in their investment 
this may result in a change in our business strategies 
we expect to need additional capital in the future  which if we are unable to raise will result in our not being able to implement our business plan as currently formulated 
because we have had net losses and  to date  have not generated positive cash flow from operations  we have funded our operating losses from the sale of equity securities from time to time 
we anticipate that our business plan will continue to require significant expenditures for research and development  patent protection  manufacturing  marketing and general operations 
our current capital resources are expected to sustain operations for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  unless we increase revenues to a level that they cover operating expenses or we reduce costs  we will require additional capital to fund these expenses 
financing  if any  may be in the form of loans or additional sales of equity securities 
a loan or the sale of preferred stock may result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations  any of which may be burdensome to the company 
the sale of equity securities will result in dilution to the current stockholders ownership 
our industry is subject to rapid technological changes which if we are unable to match or surpass  will result in a loss of competitive advantage and market opportunity 
because of the rapid technological development that regularly occurs in the microelectronics industry  we must continually devote substantial resources to developing and improving our technology and introducing new product offerings and creating new products 
for example  in fiscal year  we spent approximately million on research and development  and we expect to continue to spend a significant amount in this area in the future 
these efforts and expenditures are necessary to establish and increase market share and  ultimately  to grow revenues 
if another company offers better products or our product development lags  a competitive position or market window opportunity may be lost  and therefore our revenues or revenue potential may be adversely affected 
if our products are not commercially accepted  our developmental investment will be lost and our future business continuation will be impaired 
there can be no assurance that our research and development will produce commercially viable technologies and products 
if new technologies and products are not commercially accepted  the funds expended will not be recoverable  and our competitive and financial position will be adversely affected 
in addition  perception of our business prospects will be impaired with an adverse impact on our ability to do business and to attract capital and employees 
failing to achieve market acceptance of our dd technology will result in an adverse impact on our business prospects and compromise the market value of the technology 
our wireless technology represents what we believe to be a significant change in the circuit design of wireless radio frequency communications 
to achieve market acceptance  we will need to demonstrate the benefits of our technology over more traditional solutions through the development of marketable products and aggressive marketing 
in many respects  because the dd technology is a radically different approach in its industry  it is very difficult for us to predict the final economic benefits to users of the technology and the financial rewards that we might expect 
if the dd technology is not established in the market place as an improvement over current  traditional solutions in wireless communications  our business prospects and financial condition will be adversely affected 
if our patents and intellectual property do not provide us with the anticipated market protections and competitive position  our business and prospects will be impaired 
we rely on our intellectual property  including patents and patent applications  to provide competitive advantage and protect us from theft of our intellectual property 
we believe that many of our patents are for entirely new technologies 
if the patents are not issued or issued patents are later shown not to be as broad as currently believed or otherwise challenged such that some or all of the protection is lost  we will suffer adverse effects from the loss of competitive advantage and our ability to offer unique products and technologies 
in addition  there would be an adverse impact on the company s financial condition and business prospects 
if we do not comply with the approval requirements of the federal communications commission in respect of our products  we will not be able to market them with a resulting loss of business and prospects 
we must obtain approvals from the united states federal communications commission for the regulatory compliance of our products in the united states 
we also may have to obtain approvals from equivalent foreign government agencies where our products are sold internationally 
currently  we have obtained all required approvals 
generally the approval process is routine and takes from one to two months without substantial expense 
in the event  however  that approval is not obtained  or there is a change in current regulation that impacts issued approvals or the approval process  there may be an impact on our ability to market products and on our business prospects 
if we cannot demonstrate that our dd products can compete in the marketplace and are better than current electronics solutions  then we will not be able to generate the sales we need to continue our business and our prospects will be impaired 
in respect of the current product offerings  we now face competition from other finished product suppliers such as the linksys division of cisco  netgear  belkin and d link 
we also face competition from chip suppliers such as rf microdevices  anadigics  maxim and conexant  among others 
our technology may also face competition from other emerging approaches or new technological advances which are under development and have not yet emerged 
we obtain critical components for our products from various suppliers and licensors  some of which are single sources  which may put us at risk if they do not fulfill our requirements or they increase prices that cannot be passed on 
we obtain critical components from various suppliers and licensors  some of which are single sources 
because we depends on outside sources for supplies and licenses of various parts of its products  we are at risk that we may not obtain these components on a timely basis or may not obtain them at all 
we maintain inventories of many components  and to date  have not experienced any significant problems with respect to obtaining components 
in addition  we have neither ended or had terminated any supply arrangements or license of critical components where an alternative has not been readily available 
notwithstanding our past history of supplies  maintaining inventory of some components and having licenses to produce in the event of non supply  if we are unable to obtain needed components  our business would be disrupted  and we would have to expend some of our resources to modify our products or find new suppliers and work with them to develop appropriate components 
we are also at risk for increases in prices imposed by sources over which we have no control 
our inability to obtain components or absorb price increases may have an adverse effect on our own ability to fulfill orders and on our financial condition 
we believe that we will rely  in large part  on key business and sales relationships for the successful commercialization of our dd technology  which if not developed or maintained  will have an adverse impact on achieving market awareness and acceptance and loss of business opportunity 
to achieve a wide market awareness and acceptance of our dd technology  as part of our business strategy  we will attempt to enter into a variety of business relationships with other companies which will incorporate the dd technology into their products and or market products based on dd technology through retail or direct marketing channels 
these will include oem and var relationships and sales through internet and storefront retailers 
these commercialization avenues are in addition to the direct marketing that we are engaged in through our own website 
our successful commercialization of the dd technology will depend in part on our ability to meet obligations under contracts in respect to the dd technology and related development requirements and the other parties using the dd technology as agreed 
the failure of the business relationships will limit the commercialization of our dd technology which will have an adverse impact on our business development and our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses 
as we increase our marketing efforts  we will become more reliant on the sales efforts of third parties that may affect revenues 
as we increase our consumer product offerings  we will seek various kinds of distribution and sales methodologies which rely on third parties 
these will include oem  var  internet resellers and standard retail outlets 
to service these sales methods  we will have to maintain inventory and supply sufficient quantities of products to the sales outlets 
therefore  we will have an increased exposure in its inventory quantities and investment and warranty obligations 
we also will have to oversee the sales efforts of these outlets to maintain pricing structures  advertising and sales quality and servicing and warranty claims 
if we are unable to supply our sales channels or the third parties sell or act in ways that harm our image  market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected with a resulting loss in sales and revenues 
marketing of our products will require expansion of our marketing staff and establishing marketing programs  which if not effective  may result in limited sales 
we have initiated consumer sales of various products 
to do this effectively and reach the mass market for electronic products  we will need to expand our sales staff and marketing programs 
if we are unable to find effective sales personnel or establish effective sales programs  we will not be able to fully realize our product offerings or grow sales 
a slower growth of sales or the harmful effects of poor marketing could increase expenses and may adversely affect sales and revenues 
we have limited experience in the commercial design and large scale manufacturing of consumer products that may result in production inadequacies  delays and rejection 
we have limited experience in the commercial design and large scale manufacturing of consumer electronic products 
from time to time we have experienced delays in starting production and maintaining production amounts at the quality levels necessary for our products 
we outsource the manufacture of certain components and will outsource some of our future consumer products 
if there are design flaws or manufacturing errors resulting from our inexperience or by the third party manufacturers  there may be resulting delays while they are corrected 
in addition  using others to manufacture on our behalf exposes us to timing  quality and delivery risks 
the failure to produce adequate numbers of products  at the quality levels expected by our customers  may result in the loss of acceptance of our consumer products  or result in excessive returns and warranty claims 
these may result in loss of commercialization opportunities as well as adversely affect revenues and cause additional  unanticipated expenses 
until we are able to sell product in large volumes  our manufacturing and sales expenses per unit will have an adverse impact on gross margins 
new products offerings may be manufactured in low quantities resulting in higher per unit costs to produce 
these costs will reduce gross margins 
it is possible that the costs to produce may not be fully recoverable resulting in write downs of inventory 
this will have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are highly dependent on mr 
jeffery parker as our chief executive officer whose services  if lost  would have an adverse impact on the leadership of the company and industry and investor perception about our future 
because of mr 
parker s position in the company and the respect he has garnered in the industries in which we operate and from the investment community  the loss of the services of mr 
parker might be seen as an impediment to the execution of the our business plan 
if mr 
parker were no longer available to the company  investors may experience an adverse impact on their investment 
mr 
parker has an employment contract that expires in september we maintain key employee life insurance for our benefit on mr 
parker 
if we are unable to attract the highly skilled employees we need for research and development and sales and servicing  it will not be able to execute its research and development plans or provide the highly technical services that our products require 
our business is very specialized  and therefore it is dependent on having skilled and specialized employees to conduct our research and development activities  manufacturing  marketing and support 
the inability to obtain these kinds of persons will have an adverse impact on our business development because persons will not obtain the information or services expected in the markets and may prevent us from successfully implementing our current business plans 
the outstanding options and warrants may affect the market price and liquidity of the common stock 
at december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and had  exercisable options and warrants for the purchase shares of common stock 
on december  and  there will be  and  respectively of the currently outstanding options and warrants exercisable 
all of the underlying common stock of these securities is or will be registered for sale to the holder or for public resale by the holder 
the amount of common stock available for the sales may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and may affect the price and liquidity of the common stock in the public market 
in addition  the issuance of these shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on current stockholders ownership 
provisions in the certificate of the incorporation and by laws could have effects that conflict with the interest of stockholders 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control 
for example  the board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  and there are pre notification provisions for director nominations and submissions of proposals from stockholders to a vote by all the stockholders under the by laws 
florida law also has anti takeover provisions in its corporate statute
