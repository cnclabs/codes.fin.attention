item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview nike designs  develops and markets high quality footwear  apparel  equipment and accessory products worldwide 
we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts  nike owned retail stores  independent distributors and licensees  in the united states and over countries worldwide 
our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable portfolio of global footwear  apparel  equipment and accessories brands 
our strategy for building this portfolio is focused in four key areas deepening our relationship with consumers  delivering superior  innovative products to the marketplace  making our supply chain a competitive advantage  through operational discipline and excellence  and accelerating growth through focused execution 
by executing this strategy  we aim to deliver the following long term financial goals high single digit revenue growth  mid teens earnings per share growth  increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows  and consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses 

table of contents in fiscal we met or surpassed these financial goals 
our revenues grew to billion  net income grew to billion  and we delivered diluted earnings per share of  a increase versus fiscal the impact of foreign currency changes has had a favorable impact on this year s consolidated results of operations  primarily as a contributor to the growth in our gross margin percentage 
for fiscal  our consolidated gross margin percentage increased basis points to 
additionally  we have improved our return on invested capital  increased free cash flow from operations and continued to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
although in any particular quarter or fiscal year we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above  we continue to believe these are appropriate long term goals

excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency  revenue growth in our international regions contributed percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth  as all three of our international regions posted higher revenues 
the us region contributed percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal sales in our other businesses operating segment drove the remainder of the improvement of consolidated revenue growth for fiscal converse  a component of the other businesses  was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal the comparison of a full year of results in fiscal versus a partial year in fiscal contributed percentage point to the consolidated revenue growth 
see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note acquisitions for additional information related to the acquisition 
during fiscal  our consolidated gross margin percentage improved basis points versus the prior year  from to 
the primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal were as follows higher gross margins in our international regions  driven primarily by our europe  middle east and africa emea region  accounted for basis points of the overall margin improvement in fiscal this improvement was driven by changes in currency hedge rates  primarily the euro  partially offset by lower in line pricing margins net revenue for current product offerings minus product costs and a higher percentage of less profitable closeout sales non current 
table of contents product offerings  the result of higher footwear and apparel closeout inventories in our emea and asia pacific regions as discussed below a year over year hedge rate improvements contributed approximately basis points to the fiscal consolidated gross margin percentage improvement 
we have hedged the majority of product purchases for fiscal and a significant portion of those are at more favorable rates than product purchases in fiscal based on these hedge rates  we expect hedge rates to have a positive impact on our gross margin percentage during fiscal as compared to fiscal  with the greater impact occurring during the first half of the year 
see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note risk management and derivatives for additional information on hedges 
b lower in line pricing margins in emea and asia pacific were due to strategies to improve product value in these regions 
in addition  increased levels of closeout sales and lower closeout pricing  the result of the liquidation of higher footwear and apparel closeout inventories this year  reduced the overall gross margin percentage improvement in those regions 
together  these factors resulted in a reduction in the consolidated gross margin percentage of about basis points for fiscal higher gross margins in the us region contributed approximately basis points to the improvement in the consolidated gross margin percentage for fiscal fewer  more profitable closeouts in footwear drove the improvement partially offset by increased sales discounts the result of increased sales to high volume accounts and higher product costs and air freight incurred to meet strong footwear demand 
improved gross margin percentages in our other businesses represented basis points of improvement for fiscal the addition of converse acquired in the second quarter of fiscal and exeter brands group formed in the first quarter of fiscal drove the gross margin percentage improvement 
both exeter brands group and the international portion of converse s business operate on a licensing model  which carries higher gross margins and lower operating expenses than the remainder of our other businesses 
fiscal selling and administrative expense  comprised of demand creation and operating overhead  grew versus fiscal three percentage points of the increase for fiscal were due to changes in currency exchange rates 
the impact of a full fiscal year for converse and the formation of exeter brands group added one percentage point of growth 
demand creation advertising and promotion expense grew to  million in fiscal three percentage points of the increase in demand creation were due to changes in currency exchange rates 
excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates  the increase in demand creation spending for the fiscal year was attributable to higher spending on sports marketing endorsement contracts and events primarily in the us  emea and asia pacific regions percentage points  higher advertising spending primarily in the emea region percentage points  and incremental investment in retail marketing in the us  emea and asia pacific regions percentage points 
the addition of converse and formation of exeter brands group contributed percentage points of the demand creation increase for the year 
operating overhead for fiscal was  million  a increase over fiscal changes in currency exchange rates contributed percentage points of the increase 
excluding the effects of foreign currency  operating overhead increases for fiscal were mainly attributable to higher personnel costs due to increased headcount  higher wages and benefits and increased incentive based compensation for employees percentage points  investments in emerging markets such as china  india and our central europe  middle east and africa unit and our other businesses percentage points  increased costs due to sales and leadership events percentage points and investments in nike owned retail stores percentage point 

table of contents the most significant component of other expense  net  of million for fiscal was foreign currency hedge losses 
these losses are reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note operating segments and related information 
the hedge losses reflect that the euro has strengthened since we entered into these hedge contracts 
in fiscal  foreign currency hedge losses were also the most significant component of other expense  net  of million 
the year over year improvement in other expense  net  for fiscal was mainly due to lower foreign currency hedge losses and lower net losses on asset disposals compared to those recorded in fiscal in  net foreign currency losses in other expense  net  were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits  most significantly in emea 
our estimate of the combined impact of lower foreign currency conversion losses and the favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits is a million addition to consolidated income before income taxes compared to the prior year 
if current exchange rates remain constant  we do not expect a significant impact on our consolidated income before income taxes related to foreign currency gains or losses and the offsetting translation for fiscal as compared to fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was  which is slightly higher than the fiscal rate of primarily due to decreases in tax credits partially offset by lower taxes on foreign earnings in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal we decided to repatriate million of foreign earnings during fiscal under the american jobs creation act the act  which was signed into law by the president on october  the act creates a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us by providing an dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
we elected to repatriate a combination of foreign earnings for which us taxes had previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested 
accordingly  the provisions made did not have a material impact on our income tax expense or our effective tax rate for the year 
worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november were higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal approximately point of this reported increase was due to changes in currency exchange rates versus the same period last year 
excluding this currency impact  slightly higher average selling prices for both footwear and apparel contributed point of the growth in overall futures and advance orders 
the remaining increase was due to volume increases for both footwear and apparel 
as always  the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period 
this is because the mix of orders can shift between advance futures and at once orders 
in addition  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues 
moreover  a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders  including wholesale sales of equipment  us licensed team apparel  bauer nike hockey  cole haan  converse  exeter brands group  hurley  nike golf and retail sales across all brands

the discussion following includes disclosure of pre tax income for our operating segments 
we have reported pre tax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
as discussed in note operating segments and related information in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  certain corporate costs are not included in pre tax income of our operating segments 
for emea  changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for percentage points of the reported revenue growth in fiscal excluding the effects of foreign currency  emea region revenues grew percent as each product business unit footwear  apparel and equipment experienced growth 
the following analysis excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency 
the increase over the prior year was primarily driven by increased unit sales of footwear  apparel and equipment partially offset by declines in the average prices in each of the business units 
although apparel and equipment business units experienced growth for fiscal  revenues fell slightly in the fourth quarter primarily due to comparisons to very strong sales in the prior year s fourth quarter related to the european football championships 
for fiscal  sales increases in the emerging markets in our central europe  middle east and africa unit  along with sales increases in the uk and italy  drove the growth 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales in france  germany and northern europe 

table of contents for the emea region  futures orders scheduled for delivery from june through november were percentage points higher than such orders received for the comparable period of fiscal changes in currency exchange rates contributed percentage points of this growth 
excluding the changes in currency exchange rates  the growth was driven by an increase in the region s footwear and apparel unit orders and increases in apparel s average price 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the region s footwear average price per pair  partially due to strategies to improve the product value 
emea pre tax income for fiscal was million  up versus the prior year 
higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase  more than offsetting increased selling and administrative costs 
the improved gross margins  which contributed basis points of growth to the consolidated gross margin percentage  were primarily the result of improved year over year hedge rates partially offset by reduced in line pricing margins and higher  less profitable closeout sales 
in the asia pacific region  percentage points of reported revenue growth for the fiscal year were due to changes in currency exchange rates 
the following analysis excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency 
sales in each asia pacific product business unit grew versus fiscal with the growth primarily due to unit volume  average price per unit increased slightly 
significant revenue increases in china driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand and increases in every other country in the region except australia and new zealand were the key growth drivers for fiscal for the asia pacific region  futures orders scheduled for delivery from june through november were percentage points higher than such orders received for the comparable period of fiscal changes in currency exchange rates contributed percentage points of this growth 
excluding the changes in currency exchange rates  the growth was driven by an increase in the region s footwear and apparel unit orders 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the region s average selling price per unit for footwear and apparel 
pre tax income for the asia pacific region increased versus fiscal to million 
higher revenues were partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased selling and administrative costs 
the reduced gross margin percentage  which had a minimal negative impact on the net overall consolidated gross margin percentage change  was primarily attributable to less profitable closeout sales and reduced in line pricing margins due to strategies to improve the product value  partially offset by better year over year currency hedge rates 
in the americas region  percentage point of the revenue growth for fiscal was due to changes in currency exchange rates 
excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency  sales in each americas product business unit grew in fiscal the revenue growth was driven primarily by higher sales in central and south america  partially offset by lower sales in canada 
in fiscal  pre tax income for the americas region increased from the prior year  to million 
the increase in pre tax income was attributable to higher revenues and an improved gross margin percentage  partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs 
the improved gross margin percentage had a minimal impact on the consolidated gross margin percentage improvement 
in the us region  revenues for fiscal grew versus fiscal  as revenues increased in each product business unit 
the increase in footwear revenue was due to a percentage point increase in unit sales and a percentage point increase in the average price per pair 
the increases in unit sales and the average price per pair are due to increased consumer demand for performance products  especially those with a suggested retail price over the increase in apparel sales for fiscal was driven by volume increases in branded apparel  partially offset by a decline in revenue from sales of licensed apparel 
the decline in revenue from licensed apparel was due to the expiration of our license agreement with the nba  in the second quarter of fiscal  and a shift in consumer preference towards branded apparel 
for the first quarter and into the second quarter of fiscal  we expect revenues generated by licensed apparel to be below the prior year levels due to the expiration of the agreement with the nba 

table of contents for the us region  futures orders scheduled for delivery from june through november increased percentage points versus the same period of the prior year 
futures orders increased due to unit growth for both footwear and apparel and higher average price per pair for footwear 
as discussed above  these reported futures do not cover all components of our overall revenues  such as us licensed apparel expected to decrease as noted above  equipment  closeouts  at once orders and retail sales 
as a result  revenue growth for the us region for the first quarter of fiscal is expected to be below the reported futures growth 
for fiscal  pre tax income for the us region was  million  a increase versus fiscal higher revenues and improved gross margin percentage drove the increase  more than offsetting higher selling and administrative costs 
the improved gross margin percentage contributed basis points of growth to the consolidated gross margin percentage growth and was primarily the result of fewer  more profitable closeouts partially offset by increased discounts and higher product costs and air freight incurred to meet strong footwear demand 
revenues and pre tax income for our other businesses in fiscal include results from bauer nike hockey inc  cole haan holdings incorporated  converse inc  hurley international llc  nike golf and exeter brands group llc 
exeter brands group llc is a wholly owned subsidiary of nike  inc  formed in the first quarter of fiscal to develop the company s business in retail channels serving value conscious consumers and to operate the business obtained in the acquisition of official starter properties llc and official starter llc collectively official starter 
for fiscal  the addition of converse  acquired in the second quarter of fiscal  and the formation of exeter brands group together drove percentage points of the other business revenue increase of over fiscal the remainder of the increase was driven by revenue growth at cole haan  nike golf and hurley 
pre tax income from the other businesses improved to million in fiscal  versus income of million in fiscal the year over year improvement was driven by the addition of converse  improved results from cole haan and bauer and the formation of the exeter brands group 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated operating results in fiscal  consolidated revenues grew versus fiscal  seven percentage points of this growth were due to changes in currency exchange rates  primarily the stronger euro 
excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency  revenue growth in our international regions contributed percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth and all three of our international regions posted higher revenues  with our asia pacific region making the largest contribution 
converse  which was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal  contributed percentage points of consolidated revenue growth 
improved sales in the us region and increases in our other businesses drove the balance of the consolidated revenue growth 
during fiscal  our consolidated gross margin percentage improved basis points versus the prior year  from to 
the primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal were as follows changes in hedge rates  primarily the euro  represented basis points of improvement for fiscal the positive impact of hedge rates on the fiscal gross margin percentage was most significant in the fourth quarter  contributing basis points of the year over year quarterly improvement 
higher in line pricing margins drove approximately basis points of the improvement in the consolidated gross margin percentage for fiscal this was primarily attributable to improved footwear margins as a result of lower product costs due to manufacturing efficiencies  reduced materials costs and lower air freight 
improved profitability on wholesale closeout sales  primarily in the us and emea regions due to improved closeout pricing margins  partially offset by increased obsolescence reserves due to a less favorable mix of product remaining in closeout inventory 
these factors 
table of contents represented approximately basis points of the improvement in the consolidated gross margin percentage for fiscal most of the remaining increase was due to improved gross margin percentages for nike owned retail stores in the us and emea regions  which contributed approximately basis points of the improvement in consolidated gross margins for fiscal fiscal selling and administrative expense grew versus fiscal demand creation expense grew to  million in fiscal seven percentage points of the increase in demand creation were due to changes in currency exchange rates 
excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates  the increase in demand creation spending for the fiscal year was attributable to higher spending on endorsement contracts in the us  primarily basketball percentage point impact  incremental investment in retail marketing in the us  emea and asia pacific regions percentage point impact  and higher advertising spending in the asia pacific region percentage point impact 
the addition of converse contributed percentage points of the demand creation increase for the year 
operating overhead for fiscal was  million  a increase over fiscal currency exchange rates contributed percentage points of the increase 
the addition of converse accounted for percentage points of growth 
other key factors driving the increase in operating overhead for the fiscal year were a increased incentive based compensation for employees percentage points  and b increased costs to support the growth of our nike golf  cole haan  bauer nike hockey and hurley businesses percentage points 
the remaining increase  about percentage points  is primarily attributable to normal wage increases and some added infrastructure necessary to support global business growth  including costs related to our worldwide supply chain initiative and additional factory outlet stores in the emea region 
other expense  net  was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal in both years  the most significant component of other expense  net  was foreign currency hedge losses 
the hedge losses reflect that the euro strengthened considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts 
also included in other expense  net  for fiscal was an increase in net losses on asset disposals  including a loss of million on land gifted to the nike foundation in the first quarter 
in  net foreign currency losses in other expense  net  were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits  most significantly in emea 
our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the favorable translation is a million addition to consolidated income before income taxes compared to the prior year 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was  which is higher than the fiscal rate of as a result of a higher tax provision on foreign earnings in fiscal included in net income for fiscal was a million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas 
this charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with bauer nike hockey and the goodwill of cole haan  reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying values 
see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note identifiable intangible assets and goodwill for further information 
operating segments for emea  changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for percentage points of the reported increase in revenues in fiscal the remaining increase over the prior year was primarily driven by nike owned retail due to the addition of new stores in fiscal and increased footwear volume led by soccer products 
excluding the impact of currency exchange movements  sales in each emea business unit grew versus fiscal emea pre tax income for fiscal was million  up versus the prior year 
higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase  more than offsetting incremental selling and 
table of contents administrative costs 
the improved gross margins were primarily the result of improved year over year hedge rates and higher in line and closeout pricing margins 
in the asia pacific region  fiscal revenues increased year over year 
eight percentage points of growth for the fiscal year were due to changes in currency exchange rates 
excluding the impact of currency exchange movements  sales in each asia pacific business unit grew versus fiscal the region s revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases  with significant revenue growth in china driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand and japan driven by strong consumer demand 
pre tax income for the asia pacific region increased to million in fiscal  up versus fiscal higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase  more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs 
the higher gross margins were primarily attributable to higher in line pricing margins and the benefit of better hedge rates on product purchases  partially offset by lower profitability of closeouts 
in the americas region  revenues increased compared to fiscal  with percentage points of the growth due to changes in currency exchange rates 
excluding the currency effects  the revenue growth was driven primarily by stronger consumer demand in south america and sales in each americas business unit grew versus fiscal in fiscal  pre tax income for the americas region increased from the prior year  to million 
the increase in pre tax income was attributable to changes in currency exchange rates slightly offset by reduced gross margins and higher selling and administrative costs 
gross margins fell due to lower in line pricing margins as well as weaker currency exchange rates in mexico 
in the us region  revenues for fiscal grew versus fiscal  as revenues increased in each business unit 
the increase in apparel sales was primarily driven by growth in sport performance product and increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel primarily in the first half of fiscal the increase in footwear revenue was due to an increase in average wholesale selling price per pair and increased sales in nike owned retail stores  partially offset by a slight decline in wholesale unit sales 
the increase in average wholesale selling price per pair was partially due to a larger percentage of sales of products with a suggested retail price over the slight decline in us footwear wholesale unit sales was largely due to changes in distribution to several retail customers 
for the first half of the year  sales to our largest customer  foot locker  were lower as a result of changes to our distribution strategy implemented in fiscal and  while the decline in first half sales resulted in slightly lower sales for the full year  our year over year sales to foot locker grew in the second half of fiscal in addition  fiscal sales declined for another large customer  footstar  which declared bankruptcy in march the sales declines for foot locker and footstar were partially offset by increased sales to other accounts 
for fiscal  pre tax income for the us region was  million  a increase versus fiscal higher revenues and gross margins drove the increase  more than offsetting higher selling and administrative costs 
the improved gross margins were primarily the result of higher in line and closeout pricing margins and expanded retail margins

table of contents liquidity and capital resources fiscal cash flow activity cash provided by operations was billion in fiscal  compared to billion in fiscal our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of billion 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was not significantly affected by the net change in working capital 
in fiscal  a net decrease in working capital provided million in cash flow primarily due to improved cash management of our accounts receivable and timing of inventory receipts and vendor payments 
cash used by investing activities during fiscal was million  compared to million invested during fiscal the most significant uses of cash for investing activities in fiscal were net additions to property  plant and equipment of million  and a net increase in short term investments purchases partially offset by the maturities 
the additions to property  plant and equipment reflect capital expenditures on computer equipment and software to support both normal business operations and our supply chain systems upgrade  and continued investment in nike owned retail stores 
the improvement over the prior year was primarily due to lower net purchases of short term investments and lower costs associated with the acquisition of subsidiaries 
in fiscal and since inception of our current share repurchase program  we purchased approximately million shares of nike s class b common stock for million 
the share repurchases were part of a four year billion share repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors in june we expect to continue to fund this program from operating cash flow 
the timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the program will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 
dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal were  compared to in fiscal we have paid a dividend every quarter since february our current dividend policy is to provide an annual dividend equal to to of the trailing twelve months earnings per share paid out on a quarterly basis

actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and or royalties on product sales in future periods 
actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods 
in addition to the cash payments  we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with nike products for their use 
it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product 
the amount of product 
table of contents provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions  the number of sporting events in which they participate  and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives 
in addition  the costs to design  develop  source  and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 
we generally order product four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers 
the amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business  that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms 
in some cases  prices are subject to change throughout the production process 
the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
the amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements  including open purchase orders for non product purchases 
the reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
excluded from the table above is a commitment to an outsourcing contractor that provides us with information technology operations management services through fiscal the amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor s services 
if we were to terminate the entire contract as of may   we would be required to provide the contractor with four months notice and pay a termination fee of million 
our monthly payments to the contractor currently approximate million 
subsequent to may   we extended this contract through fiscal with substantially the same terms as noted above  however  the termination fee increased to approximately million upon execution of the renewed contract and our estimated monthly payments decreased to approximately million 
we also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of may  please refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note short term borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below 
outstanding as of may  in millions notes payable  due at mutually agreed upon dates  generally ninety days from issuance or on demand payable to sojitz corporation of america sojitz america for the purchase of inventories  generally due sixty days after shipment of goods from a foreign port as of may   letters of credit of million were outstanding  primarily for the purchase of inventory 
all letters of credit generally expire within one year 
capital resources in october  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec under which billion in debt securities may be issued 
in may  we commenced a medium term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to million in medium term notes  as our capital needs dictate 
we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements 
during fiscal  there were no medium term notes issued under the program 
in previous years million in medium term notes were issued under the program 
currently  million remains available to be issued under the shelf registration 
we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal depending on general corporate needs 
as of may   we had a multi year million revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks  and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility 
the maturity date is november  
table of contents and the facility can be extended for one additional year on the anniversary date 
based on our current long term senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively  the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing libor plus 
the facility fee is of the total commitment 
if our long term debt rating were to decline  the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase 
conversely  if our long term debt rating were to improve  the facility fee and interest rate would decrease 
changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities 
under this committed credit facility  we have agreed to various covenants 
these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur  and set a minimum capitalization ratio 
in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility  failed to meet any covenant  and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks  any borrowings would become immediately due and payable 
as of may   we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 
liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program  under which there was no amount outstanding at may  or may  we currently have short term debt ratings of a and p from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively 
we currently believe that cash generated by operations  together with access to external sources of funds as described above  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter fas 
fas clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for our fiscal year beginning june  we are currently evaluating the provisions of fas and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on december   the fasb finalized sfas no 
r share based payment  fas r which  after the securities and exchange commission sec amended the compliance dates on april   will be effective for our fiscal year beginning june  the new standard will require us to record compensation expense for stock options using a fair value method 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides the staff s views regarding interactions between fas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we are currently evaluating fas r and sab to determine the fair value method to measure compensation expense  the appropriate assumptions to include in the fair value model and the transition method to use upon adoption 
the impact of the adoption of fas r is not known at this time due to these factors as well as the unknown level of share based payments granted in future years 
the effect on our results of operations of expensing stock options using the black scholes model is presented in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies 
under certain conditions  stock options granted by the company are eligible for accelerated vesting upon the retirement of the employee 
the fasb clarified in fas r that the fair value of such stock options should be expensed based on an accelerated vesting schedule or immediately  rather than ratably over the vesting period stated in the grant 
our pro forma disclosure currently reflects the expense of such options ratably over the stated vesting period  expensing all unvested shares upon actual retirement 
the sec has recently clarified that companies should continue to follow the vesting method they have been using until adoption of fas r  then apply the accelerated vesting schedule to all subsequent grants to those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement 
had we been accounting for such stock options 
table of contents using the accelerated vesting schedule for those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement  we would have recognized additional stock based compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure of the effect of expensing stock options presented in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies of per diluted share in fiscal  and critical accounting policies our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policies for revenue recognition  the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves  and contingent payments under endorsement contracts 
these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
revenue recognition we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
in certain countries outside of the us  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location 
on the basis of our tests of actual transactions  we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims  and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future 
table of contents changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 
contingent payments under endorsement contracts a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts 
in general  endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract 
however  certain contract elements may be accounted for differently  based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 
some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg  winning a championship 
we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 
some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg  maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year 
these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period 
in these instances  to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser s athletic performance  increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 
some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products 
we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made 
in certain contracts  we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments 
for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product  we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment  including buildings  equipment  and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including  in some cases  the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened  we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property  plant and equipment may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value 
any impairment charges are recorded as other expense  net 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted 
table of contents cash flows may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 
goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted fas effective for the first quarter of fiscal in accordance with fas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by fas  in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value  we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value 
our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors  including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units 
our estimates may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological change  economic conditions  changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 
as discussed further above  upon adoption of fas in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets of million 
this charge is shown on our consolidated statement of income as the cumulative effect of accounting change 
subsequent to adoption  any goodwill impairment charges would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 
other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges would be classified as other expense  net 
intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in these cases  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value 
any impairment charges would be classified as other expense  net 
hedge accounting for derivatives we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions  as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance 
when specific criteria required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted fas have been met  changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
in most cases  this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their very nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions changes significantly  we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other expense  net during the quarter in which such changes occur 
once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels  we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 
taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss 
table of contents carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
in addition  we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore  and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation 
despite this approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
for instance  the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations  or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 
conversely  our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
in this case  our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year 
the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items  to determine the year to date tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other expense  net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures  we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 
it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures  we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales  product sourcing and funding activities 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements 
we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge 
table of contents certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
when we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions 
generally  all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months  although at may  we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as months 
the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our european and japanese subsidiaries 
we use forward contracts to hedge non functional currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements 
when intercompany loans are hedged  it is typically for their expected duration 
hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros  japanese yen  canadian dollars  korean won  australian dollars  and mexican pesos 
our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates 
our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to reduce overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a mix of medium and long term fixed rate debt  commercial paper  and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps 
market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk var 
our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments  as defined by the sec  are foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency option contracts  interest rate swaps  intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 
we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only 
the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year 
the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate 
we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate 
this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only  and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions  firm commitments  cash balances  and accounts and loans receivable and payable  including those which are hedged by these instruments 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments  derived using the var model  was and million at may  and may   respectively 
the increase in var as of may  occurred due to a larger portfolio of foreign currency derivative instruments which was largely offset by the effect of lower currency volatility on existing trades on the may  var computation versus the may  var computation 
such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 

table of contents details of other market sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below  except the interest rate swaps which are described below 
these instruments include intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

table of contents intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation 
intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties  as discussed above 
the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our japanese subsidiaries 
accordingly  the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries 
there were no significant changes in debt market risks during fiscal we did not issue any long term fixed rate corporate bonds during fiscal  however  during fiscal  and fiscal we issued a total of million in long term fixed rate corporate bonds that mature between august and october fixed interest rates on these bonds range from to 
for each of the bonds issued in fiscal  and fiscal  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the three month or six month libor plus a spread 
as a result of the interest rate swap agreements the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was at may  and at may  each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond  except for one swap for a million bond issued in fiscal the million bond issued in fiscal matures in october whereas the associated interest rate swap expires in october these interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges  so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt  except for the million swap expiring in october which is not accounted for as a hedge 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded to net income each period 
the recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net million gain at may  and a million gain at may  the recorded fair value of the million interest rate swap expiring october was not material for the years ended may  and in fiscal we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries 
the japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on month libor plus a spread 
under the interest rate swap agreement  the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at and receives variable interest payments based on month libor plus a spread based on a notional amount of billion japanese yen 
this interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge  accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period
