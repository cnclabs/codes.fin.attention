item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
these statements are based on our current assessment of risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements and  therefore  undue reliance should not be placed on them 
important factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements are discussed in this report  including the sections entitled cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  and business risk factors 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented under item general overview arch capital group ltd 
acgl and  together with its subsidiaries  we  or us is a bermuda public limited liability company with over billion in capital and  through operations in bermuda  the united states and europe  writes insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis 
while we are positioned to provide a full range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance lines  we focus on writing specialty lines of insurance and reinsurance 
it is our belief that our underwriting platform  our experienced management team and our strong capital base that is unencumbered by significant pre risks have enabled us to establish a strong presence in an attractive insurance and reinsurance marketplace 
the worldwide insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive and has traditionally been subject to an underwriting cycle in which a hard market high premium rates  restrictive underwriting standards  as well as terms and conditions  and underwriting gains is eventually followed by a soft market low premium rates  relaxed underwriting standards  as well as terms and conditions  and underwriting losses 
insurance market conditions may affect  among other things  the demand for our products  our ability to increase premium rates  the terms and conditions of the insurance policies we write  changes in the products offered by us or changes in our business strategy 
the financial results of the insurance and reinsurance industry are influenced by factors such as the frequency and or severity of claims and losses  including natural disasters or other catastrophic events  variations in interest rates and financial markets  changes in the legal  regulatory and judicial environments  inflationary pressures and general economic conditions 
these factors influence  among other things  the demand for insurance or reinsurance  the supply of which is generally related to the total capital of competitors in the market 
during  market conditions had been improving primarily as a result of declining insurance capacity 
in general  market conditions improved during and in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace 
this reflected improvement in pricing  terms and conditions following significant industry losses arising from the events of september th  as well as the recognition that intense competition in the late s led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms  conditions and coverages 
such industry developments resulted in poor financial results and erosion of the industry s capital base 
consequently  many established insurers and reinsurers reduced their participation in  or exited from  certain markets and  as a result  premium rates escalated in many lines of business 
these developments provided relatively new insurers and reinsurers  like us  with an opportunity to provide needed underwriting capacity 
beginning in late and continuing through  additional capacity emerged in many classes of business and  consequently  premium rate increases have decelerated and  in several classes of business  premium rates have decreased 
however  we believe that we are still able to write insurance and reinsurance business at what we believe to be attractive rates 
we expect that our rate of growth in will continue to moderate  despite our expansion into the european and canadian markets  as we respond to more challenging market conditions 
as previously reported  we have received various formal and informal information requests from insurance regulatory authorities as to relationships with  and payments to  brokers and other agents 
in addition  we received a subpoena from the new york state attorney general requesting certain information concerning our underwriting activities with respect to insurance coverages to lawyers and law firms for acts of professional malpractice 
we are cooperating with these requests 
in view of the ongoing industry investigation  we retained cahill gordon reindel llp to conduct an internal review relating to certain business practices in the insurance industry currently being investigated by the attorney general of new york and others 
they recently informed us that their review is complete and that they have found no evidence that we have engaged in illegal bid rigging or price fixing such as alleged in the new york attorney general s october  complaint against marsh mcclennan companies  inc  and have found no evidence that we have engaged in any illegal tying of insurance and reinsurance services 
history we commenced operations in september following the completion of the initial public offering of our predecessor  arch capital group us inc us 
us is a delaware company formed in march under the original name of risk capital holdings  inc from that time until may  we provided reinsurance and other forms of capital to insurance companies 
on may   we sold our prior reinsurance book of business to folksamerica reinsurance company folksamerica in an asset sale  but retained our surplus and our us licensed reinsurance platform 
on november   following shareholder approval  we changed our legal domicile to bermuda in order to benefit from bermuda s favorable business  regulatory  tax and financing environment 
during the period from may through the announcement of our underwriting initiative in october  we built and acquired insurance businesses that were intended to enable us to generate both fee based revenue eg  commissions and advisory and management fees and risk based revenue ie  insurance premium 
as part of this strategy  we built an underwriting platform that was intended to enable us to maximize risk based revenue during periods in the underwriting cycle when we believed it was more favorable to assume underwriting risk 
in october  we concluded that underwriting conditions favored dedicating our attention exclusively to building our insurance and reinsurance business 
in october  we launched an underwriting initiative to meet current and future demand in the global insurance and reinsurance markets that included the recruitment of new insurance and reinsurance management teams and an equity capital infusion of million 
in april  we completed an offering of common shares and received net proceeds of million and  in september  we received proceeds of million from the exercise of class a warrants by our principal shareholders and certain other investors 
in march  we completed a public offering of common shares and received net proceeds of million and  in may  we completed a public offering of million principal amount of senior notes due may  and received net proceeds of million  of which million of the net proceeds was used to repay all amounts outstanding under our existing credit facility 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the issuance of insurance policies and reinsurance contracts 
insurance and reinsurance premiums are driven by the volume and classes of business of the policies and contracts that we write which  in turn  are related to prevailing market conditions 
the premium we charge for the risks assumed is also based on many assumptions 
we price these risks well before our ultimate costs are known  which may extend many years into the future 
in addition  our revenues include fee income and income we generate from our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed income investments that are classified as available for sale 
under our basis of accounting  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  these investments are carried at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses on the investments are not included in our statement of income 
these unrealized gains and losses are included on our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
costs and expenses our costs and expenses primarily consist of losses and loss adjustment expenses  acquisition costs  other operating expenses and non cash compensation 
losses and loss adjustment expenses include management s best estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred during a reporting period 
such costs consist of three components paid losses  changes in estimated amounts for known losses case reserves  and changes in reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr losses 
see critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for further discussion 
acquisition expenses  net of ceding commissions received from unaffiliated reinsurers  consist primarily of commissions  brokerage and taxes paid to obtain our business 
a significant portion of such costs is paid based on a percentage of the premium written and will vary for each class or type of business that we underwrite 
other operating expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses 
non cash compensation  which relates to certain grants primarily of restricted common shares under our stock incentive plans and other arrangements  includes costs related to our capital raising activities and the commencement of our new underwriting initiative in the issuance of restricted common shares and the related recognition of non cash compensation expense have no impact on our shareholders equity 
critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities including reserves  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  insurance and other reserves  reinsurance recoverables  investment valuations  intangible assets  bad debts  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where possible  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and judgments for a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company  like our company  are even more difficult to make than those made in a mature company since limited historical information has been reported to us through december  actual results will differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require our more significant judgments and estimates 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we are required by applicable insurance laws and regulations and gaap to establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses that arise from the business we underwrite 
these reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured or reinsured claims which have occurred at or before the balance sheet date 
due to the lack of historical loss data for our reinsurance and insurance operations  and the resulting inability to use a historical loss development methodology  there is a possibility that significant changes in the reserve estimates in future periods could occur 
insurance and reinsurance loss reserves are inherently subject to uncertainty 
the period of time from the occurrence of a loss through the settlement of the liability may extend many years into the future 
during this period  additional facts and trends will become known and  as these factors become apparent  reserves will be adjusted in the period in which the new information becomes known 
while reserves are established based upon available information  certain factors  such as those inherent in the political  judicial and legal systems  including judicial and litigation trends and legislation changes  could impact the ultimate liability 
changes to our prior year loss reserves can impact our current underwriting results by reducing our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be deficient or improving our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant 
the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of losses incurred  and it is likely that the ultimate liability may exceed or be less than such estimates 
we utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance and reinsurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of loss reserves 
even actuarially sound methods can lead to subsequent adjustments to loss reserves that are both significant and irregular due to the nature of the risks written  potentially by a material amount 
for our reinsurance operations  we establish case reserves based on reports of claims notices received from ceding companies 
case reserves usually are based upon the amount of reserves recommended by the ceding company 
reported case reserves on known events may be supplemented by additional case reserves 
additional case reserves are often estimated by our claims function ahead of official notification from the ceding company  or when our judgment regarding the size or severity of the known event differs from the ceding company 
in certain instances  we may establish additional case reserves even when the ceding company does not report any liability on a known event 
for our insurance operations  generally  claims personnel determine whether to establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate settlement of individual claims 
the estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general corporate reserving practices  the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim and  where appropriate  advice of counsel 
our insurance operations also contract with a number of outside third party administrators in the claims process who  in certain cases  have limited authority to establish case reserves 
the work of such administrators is reviewed and monitored by our claims personnel 
reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims  including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process 
periodically  adjustments to the reported or case reserves may be made as additional information regarding the claims is reported or payments are made 
we also maintain ibnr reserves 
such reserves are established to provide for incurred claims which have not yet been reported to an insurer or reinsurer at the financial statement date as well as to adjust for any projected variance in case reserving 
even though most insurance policies have policy limits  the nature of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance is such that losses can exceed policy limits for a variety of reasons and also could very significantly exceed the premiums received on the underlying policies 
we attempt to limit our risk of loss through reinsurance and may also use retrocessional arrangements 
the availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
in establishing the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  we have made various assumptions relating to the pricing of our reinsurance contracts and insurance policies and have also considered available historical industry experience and current industry conditions 
our reserving method to date has primarily been the expected loss method  which is commonly applied when limited loss experience exists 
we select the initial expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios based on information derived by our underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business  supplemented by industry data where appropriate 
these ratios consider  among other things  rate increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market 
any estimates and assumptions made as part of the reserving process could prove to be inaccurate due to several factors  including the fact that limited historical information has been reported to us through december  reinsurance operations by their nature add further complexity to the reserving process in that there is an inherent additional lag in the timing and reporting of a loss event to a reinsurer from an insured or ceding company through a broker 
as actual loss information is reported to us and we develop our own loss experience  our reserving methods will also include other actuarial techniques 
it is possible that claims in respect of events that have occurred could exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a future period or our financial condition in general 
we are only permitted to establish loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for losses that have occurred on or before the applicable financial statement date 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses do not reflect contingency reserve allowances to account for future loss occurrences 
losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the losses are incurred and could be substantial 
at december  and  our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  by type and by operating segment were as follows december  us dollars in thousands reinsurance case reserves 
  additional case reserves   ibnr reserves   total net reserves   insurance case reserves   ibnr reserves   total net reserves   total case reserves 
  additional case reserves   ibnr reserves   total net reserves   at december  and  reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  for the reinsurance segment by major line of business were as follows december  us dollars in thousands casualty   other specialty 
  property excluding property catastrophe   property catastrophe   marine and aviation   non traditional   casualty clash   total net reserves   at december  and  reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  for the insurance segment by major line of business were as follows december  us dollars in thousands programs   casualty   executive assurance   professional liability   construction and surety   property  marine and aviation 
  healthcare   other   total net reserves   as described above  we primarily use the expected loss method to calculate our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  which is commonly applied when limited loss experience exists  and represents management s best estimate of our reserves 
as the loss data develops  we will utilize other actuarial methods to evaluate our reserves 
due to the lack of historical loss data for our reinsurance and insurance operations  generally we do not produce a range of estimates in calculating reserves 
in order to illustrate the potential volatility in our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  we used a statistical model to simulate a range of results based on various probabilities 
both the probabilities and related modeling are subject to inherent uncertainties 
the simulation relies on a significant number of assumptions  such as the potential for multiple entities to react similarly to external events  and includes other statistical assumptions 
our recorded estimate of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  by operating segment at december   along with the results of the simulation are as follows december  reinsurance insurance total us dollars in thousands total net reserves    simulation results th percentile    th percentile    simulation results indicate that a percent probability exists that the net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses will not exceed the indicated amount 
simulation results indicate that a percent probability exists that the net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses will be at or below the indicated amount 
the simulation results shown for each segment do not add to the total simulation results  as the individual segment simulation results do not reflect the diversification effects across our segments 
the simulation results noted above are informational only  and no assurance can be given that our ultimate losses will not be significantly different than the simulation results shown above  and such differences could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined 
we do not have significant exposure to pre liabilities  such as asbestos related illnesses and other long tail liabilities and  to date  we have experienced a relatively low level of reported claims activity in most of our business  particularly in our longer tail exposures  such as casualty  executive assurance and professional liability  which have longer time periods during which claims are reported and paid 
our limited history does not provide any meaningful trend information 
see results of operations for a discussion of prior year development of loss reserves 
premium revenues and related expenses insurance premiums written are generally recorded at the policy inception and are primarily earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies for all products  usually twelve months 
premiums written include estimates in our program  aviation  construction and surety and collateralized protection business and for participation in involuntary pools 
the amount of such insurance premium estimates included in premiums receivable and other assets at december  and was million and million  respectively 
such premium estimates are derived from multiple sources which include the historical experience of the underlying business  similar business and available industry information 
unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written that relates to the unexpired terms of in force insurance policies 
reinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by brokers and ceding companies  supplemented by our own estimates of premiums where reports have not been received or in cases where the amounts reported by brokers and ceding companies is adjusted to reflect management s best judgments and expectations 
premium estimates are derived from multiple sources which include our underwriters  the historical experience of the underlying business  similar business and available industry information 
premiums written are recorded based on the type of contracts we write 
premiums on our excess of loss and pro rata reinsurance contracts are estimated when the business is underwritten 
for excess of loss contracts  the minimum premium  as defined in the contract  is generally recorded as an estimate of premiums written as of the date of the treaty 
estimates of premiums written under pro rata contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by the brokers and the ceding companies 
for multi year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments  generally  only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy 
the remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 
the amount of reinsurance premium estimates included in premiums receivable and the amount of related acquisition expenses by type of business was as follows at december  and december  gross amount acquisition expenses net amount gross amount acquisition expenses net amount us dollars in thousands casualty      other specialty      property excluding property catastrophe    marine and aviation      property catastrophe      non traditional      casualty clash total      premium estimates are reviewed at least quarterly  based on management s detailed review  comparing actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the aging and collection of premium estimates 
based on management s review  the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated  and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes known 
adjustments to premium estimates could be material and such adjustments could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined because the estimated premium may be fully or substantially earned 
a significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable  which represent estimated premiums written  net of commissions  are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
based on currently available information  management believes that the premium estimates included in premiums receivable will be collectible and  therefore  no provision for doubtful accounts has been recorded on the premium estimates at december  reinsurance premiums assumed  irrespective of the class of business  are generally earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the underlying policies or reinsurance contracts 
contracts and policies written on a losses occurring basis cover claims that may occur during the term of the contract or policy  which is typically months 
accordingly  the premium is earned evenly over the term 
contracts which are written on a risks attaching basis cover claims which attach to the underlying insurance policies written during the terms of such contracts 
premiums earned on such contracts usually extend beyond the original term of the reinsurance contract  typically resulting in recognition of premiums earned over a month period 
certain of our reinsurance contracts include provisions that adjust premiums or acquisition expenses based upon the experience under the contracts 
premiums written and earned  as well as related acquisition expenses  are recorded based upon the projected experience under such contracts 
we also write certain business that is intended to provide insurers with risk management solutions that complement traditional reinsurance 
under these contracts  we assume a measured amount of insurance risk in exchange for an anticipated margin  which is typically lower than on traditional reinsurance contracts 
the terms and conditions of these contracts may include additional or return premiums based on loss experience  loss corridors  sublimits and caps 
examples of such business include aggregate stop loss coverages and financial quota share coverages 
certain assumed reinsurance contracts  which pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  are deemed  for financial reporting purposes  not to transfer insurance risk  are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting as prescribed in statement of position sop  deposit accounting accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not transfer insurance risk 
however  it is possible that we could incur financial losses on such contracts 
management exercises significant judgment in the assumptions used in determining whether assumed contracts should be accounted for as reinsurance contracts under sfas no 
or deposit insurance contracts under sop under sop  for those contracts that contain an element of underwriting risk  the estimated profit margin is deferred and amortized over the contract period and such amount is included in our underwriting results 
when the estimated profit margin is explicit  the margin is reflected as fee income and any adverse financial results on such contracts are reflected as incurred losses 
when the estimated profit margin is implicit  the margin is reflected as an offset to paid losses and any adverse financial results on such contracts are reflected as incurred losses 
for those contracts that do not transfer an element of underwriting risk  the projected profit is reflected in earnings over the estimated settlement period using the interest method and such profit is included in investment income 
additional judgments are required when applying the accounting guidance set forth in sop with respect to the revenue recognition criteria for contracts deemed not to transfer insurance risk 
retroactive reinsurance reimburses a ceding company for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events covered by the underlying policies reinsured 
in certain instances  reinsurance contracts cover losses both on a prospective basis and on a retroactive basis and  accordingly  we bifurcate the prospective and retrospective elements of these reinsurance contracts and account for each element separately 
underwriting income generated in connection with retroactive reinsurance contracts is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period while losses are charged to income immediately 
subsequent changes in estimated or actual cash flows under such retroactive reinsurance contracts are accounted for by adjusting the previously deferred amount to the balance that would have existed had the revised estimate been available at the inception of the reinsurance transaction  with a corresponding charge or credit to income 
acquisition expenses and other expenses that vary with  and are directly related to  the acquisition of business in our underwriting operations are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
acquisition expenses  net of ceding commissions received from unaffiliated reinsurers  consist primarily of commissions  brokerage and taxes paid to obtain our business 
other operating expenses also include expenses that vary with  and are directly related to  the acquisition of business 
deferred acquisition costs  which are based on the related unearned premiums  are carried at their estimated realizable value and take into account anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses  based on historical and current experience  and anticipated investment income 
collection of insurance related balances and provision for doubtful accounts we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance ceded because the ceding of risk to reinsurers or retrocessionaires does not relieve us of our liability to the clients or companies we insure or reinsure 
we are also subject to risks based upon the possibility that loss payments could occur earlier than the receipt of related reinsurance recoverables 
if the financial condition of our reinsurers or retrocessionaires deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we will provide for probable losses resulting from our inability to collect amounts due from such parties  as appropriate 
we evaluate the credit worthiness of all the reinsurers to which we cede business 
if our analysis indicates that there is significant uncertainty regarding the collectibility of amounts due from reinsurers  managing general agents  brokers and other clients  we will record a provision for doubtful accounts 
at december  and  our reserve for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million  respectively 
approximately of our premiums receivable of million at december  represented amounts not yet due  while amounts in excess of days overdue were of the total 
approximately of the million of paid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable were in excess of days overdue at december  we are also subject to credit risk from our alternative market products  such as rent a captive risk sharing programs  which allow a client to retain a significant portion of its loss exposure without the administrative costs and capital commitment required to establish and operate its own captive 
in certain of these programs  we participate in the operating results by providing excess reinsurance coverage and earn commissions and management fees 
in addition  we write program business on a risk sharing basis with managing general agents or brokers  which may be structured with commissions which are contingent on the underwriting results of the program 
while we attempt to obtain collateral from such parties in an amount sufficient to guarantee their projected financial obligations to us  there is no guarantee that such collateral will be sufficient to secure their actual ultimate obligations 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes 
a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred income tax asset may not be realized 
we consider future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets would be charged to income in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition  if we subsequently assess that the valuation allowance is no longer needed  a benefit would be recorded to income in the period in which such determination is made 
investments we currently classify all of our fixed maturity investments  short term investments and publicly traded equity securities as available for sale and  accordingly  they are carried at estimated fair value 
the fair value of fixed maturity securities is determined from quotations received from a nationally recognized pricing service 
short term investments comprise securities due to mature within one year of the date of issue 
short term investments include certain cash equivalents which are part of our investment portfolios under the management of external investment managers 
investments included in our private portfolio include securities issued by privately held companies 
our investments in privately held equity securities are carried at estimated fair value 
fair value is initially considered to be equal to the cost of such investment until the investment is revalued based on substantive events or other factors which could indicate a diminution or appreciation in value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  we periodically review our investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
our process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors 
these factors include i the time period in which there has been a significant decline in value  ii an analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  iii the significance of the decline and iv our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover 
where our analysis of the above factors results in the conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary  the cost of the securities is written down to fair value and is reflected as a realized loss 
with respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security s value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
as mentioned above  we consider our intent and ability to hold a security until the value recovers in the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline 
however  this factor  on its own  is not determinative as to whether we will recognize an impairment charge 
we believe our ability to hold such securities is supported by our positive cash flow from operations where we can generate sufficient liquidity in order to meet our claims payment obligations arising from our underwriting operations without selling such investments 
however  subsequent decisions to sell a security are made within the context of overall risk management  new information and the assessment of such security s value relative to comparable securities 
while our external investment managers may  at a given point in time  believe the preferred course of action is to hold securities until such losses are recovered  the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision by us to sell the security and realize the loss  based upon a change in market and other factors discussed above 
we believe these subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as available for sale 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus regarding eitf the consensus provides guidance for evaluating whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and was effective beginning with the third quarter 
in october  the fasb issued a final fasb staff position that delayed the effective date of the application guidance on impairment of securities that is included in paragraphs through of eitf the annual disclosure requirements under paragraphs through of eitf have not been deferred 
we are currently awaiting updated guidance from the eitf in order to be able to evaluate the impact that eitf may have on our consolidated financial statements 
the delay in the effective date for the application guidance is not a suspension of currently existing accounting requirements for assessing other than temporary impairments for securities under sfas no 
or other current accounting standards  including current guidance for cost method and equity method investments 
see note  investment information  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
stock issued to employees we have adopted the provisions of apb opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options because the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires the use of option valuation models that we believe were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
accordingly  under apb no 
 compensation expense for stock option grants is recognized only to the extent that the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option at the measurement date 
for restricted shares granted  we record deferred compensation equal to the market value of the shares at the measurement date  which is amortized and primarily charged to income as non cash compensation over the vesting period 
these restricted shares are recorded as outstanding upon issuance regardless of any vesting period 
see results of operations for a discussion of non cash compensation 
we repurchase shares  from time to time  from employees in order to facilitate the payment of withholding taxes on restricted shares granted 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
and requires that the estimated expense resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r eliminates the alternative to disclose  on a pro forma basis  the effects of the fair value based method 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas r on the results of its operations 
however  the impact of adopting sfas no 
r will have no effect on our cash flows or shareholders equity

such amount was partially offset by an increase in acquisition expenses of million  or a point increase in the acquisition expense ratio 
in addition  in its reserving process in and  the reinsurance segment recognized that there is a possibility that the assumptions made could prove to be inaccurate due to several factors primarily related to the start up nature of its operations 
due to the availability of additional data  and based on reserve analyses  it was determined that it was no longer necessary to continue to include such factors in the reserving process in following a reserve review in the fourth quarter  and based on the level of claims activity reported to date  the reinsurance segment reduced the amount it had recorded in and by million

in addition  option valuation models  such as the black scholes model  require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
as our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  we believe that the existing option valuation models  such as the black scholes model  may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee stock options

accordingly  approximately million is available for dividends or distributions during without prior approval under bermuda law  as discussed above 
our us insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries can pay million in dividends or distributions to arch re bermuda during without prior regulatory approval  but such dividends or distributions may be subject to applicable withholding or other taxes 
in addition  the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is also constrained by our dependence on financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies 
our ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on the capitalization levels of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
in october  arch re bermuda paid a dividend of million to acgl 
on november   acgl paid its semi annual interest payment on the senior notes of million 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are required to maintain assets on deposit with various regulatory authorities to support their operations 
the assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities to third parties 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for letters of credit to third parties 
at december  and  such amounts approximated million and million  respectively 
in addition  arch re bermuda maintains assets in trust accounts to support insurance and reinsurance transactions with affiliated us companies 
at december  and  such amounts approximated billion and billion  respectively 
acgl  through its subsidiaries  provides financial support to certain of its insurance subsidiaries and affiliates  through certain reinsurance arrangements essential to the ratings of such subsidiaries 
except as described in the preceding sentence  or where express reinsurance  guarantee or other financial support contractual arrangements are in place  each of acgl s subsidiaries or affiliates is solely responsible for its own liabilities and commitments and no other acgl subsidiary or affiliate is so responsible 
any reinsurance arrangements  guarantees or other financial support contractual arrangements that are in place are solely for the benefit of the acgl subsidiary or affiliate involved and third parties creditors or insureds of such entity are not express beneficiaries of such arrangements 
our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance  sometimes substantially in advance  of the time losses are paid 
the period of time from the occurrence of a claim through the settlement of the liability may extend many years into the future 
sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations  financing arrangements or routine sales of investments 
as part of our investment strategy  we seek to establish a level of cash and highly liquid short term and intermediate term securities which  combined with expected cash flow  is believed by us to be adequate to meet our foreseeable payment obligations 
however  due to the nature of our operations  cash flows are affected by claim payments that may comprise large payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate from year to year 
for  we have currently estimated that claim payments will be approximately million 
we believe that our liquid investments and cash flow will provide us with sufficient liquidity in order to meet our claim payment obligations 
however  the timing and amounts of actual claim payments related to recorded reserves vary based on many factors including large individual losses  changes in the legal environment  as well as general market conditions 
the ultimate amount of the claim payments could differ materially from our estimated amounts 
certain lines of business written by us  such as excess casualty  have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity 
the foregoing may result in significant variability in loss payment patterns 
the impact of this variability can be exacerbated by the fact that the timing of the receipt of reinsurance recoverables owed to us may be slower than anticipated by us 
therefore  the irregular timing of claim payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods and may require us to utilize other sources of liquidity to make these payments  which may include the sale of investments or utilization of existing or new credit facilities or capital market transactions 
if the source of liquidity is the sale of investments  we may be forced to sell such investments at a loss  which may be material 
consolidated cash provided by operating activities was billion for  compared to billion for and million for cash flow from operating activities are provided by premiums collected  fee income  investment income and collected reinsurance recoverables  offset by losses and loss adjustment expense payments  reinsurance premiums paid  operating costs and current taxes paid 
the increase in cash flow was primarily due to the growth in premium volume and a low level of claim payments due  in part  to the limited history of our insurance and reinsurance operations 
we expect that our operational needs  including our anticipated insurance obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs  for the next twelve months  at a minimum  will be met by our balance of cash  short term investments and our credit facilities  as well as by funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income and proceeds on the sale or maturity of our investments 
we monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis and will seek to adjust our capital base up or down according to the needs of our business 
the future capital requirements of our business will depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies 
in particular  we require sufficient capital to maintain our financial strength ratings  as issued by several ratings agencies  at a level considered necessary by management to enable our key operating subsidiaries to compete  sufficient capital to enable our underwriting subsidiaries to meet the capital adequacy tests performed by statutory agencies in the us and other key markets  and letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are required by our non us operating companies that are non admitted under us state insurance regulations 
as part of our capital management program  we may seek to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases  cash dividends or other methods or a combination of such methods 
we are currently reviewing our capital needs for based on current available information  it is more likely that we will seek to implement a plan to return capital to our shareholders during  rather than raise additional capital 
any such determination will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our profits  financial requirements and other factors  including legal restrictions  rating agency requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to fund our future operating requirements or maintain such ratings  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth 
if we are not able to obtain adequate capital  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  which could include  among other things  the following possible outcomes potential downgrades in the financial strength ratings assigned by ratings agencies to our operating subsidiaries  which could place those operating subsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage compared to higher rated competitors  reductions in the amount of business that our operating subsidiaries are able to write in order to meet capital adequacy based tests enforced by statutory agencies  and any resultant ratings downgrades could  among other things  affect our ability to write business and increase the cost of bank credit and letters of credit 
in addition to common share capital  we depend on external sources of finance to support our underwriting activities  which can be in the form or any combination of debt securities  preference shares  common equity and bank credit 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are unfavorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and  in any case  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities 
in march  we completed a public offering of  of our common shares and received net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of the offering were used to support the underwriting activities of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes 
in may  we completed a public offering of million principal amount of senior notes due may  and received net proceeds of million 
we used million of the net proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under our existing credit facility and the remaining net proceeds were used to support the underwriting activities of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes 
see contractual obligations and commercial commitments senior notes for a description of the senior notes 
in may  we capitalized our subsidiary  arch europe  with million or million when capitalized 
shortly following such capitalization  the financial services authority licensed arch europe as an authorized insurer in the uk  and arch europe commenced operating as an underwriting center for the insurance segment 
in  we recorded a foreign currency translation adjustment gain of million 
such amount is included as part of other comprehensive income and is related to foreign currency exchange rate movement in arch europe s operations 
in december  we capitalized a canadian branch of our us insurance group  which began writing business in the first quarter of  through funding a trust with canadian cad million or million when capitalized 
during the fourth quarter  we completed the sale of two operating units which were not considered part of our core insurance and reinsurance operations 
in october  we completed the sale of hales and in december  we completed the sale of our non standard automobile insurance operations  american independent and psic  for a cash purchase price of million in cash  which had the effect of monetizing million of goodwill 
we recorded million of losses on such sales  which are included in other income loss 
during specified periods  our reinsurance group will continue to provide reinsurance support to american independent and psic 
in july  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
this registration statement allows for the possible future offer and sale by us of up to million of various types of securities  including unsecured debt securities  preference shares  common shares  warrants  share purchase contracts and units and depositary shares 
the shelf registration statement enables us to cost effectively and efficiently access public debt and or equity capital markets in order to meet our future capital needs 
in addition  our shelf registration statement allows selling shareholders to resell up to an aggregate of  common shares that they own or may acquire upon the conversion of outstanding preference shares or warrants in one or more offerings from time to time 
we will not receive any proceeds from the shares offered by the selling shareholders 
this report is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state 
in september  we entered into a three year agreement for a million unsecured revolving loan and letter of credit facility and a million secured letter of credit facility 
the million unsecured portion of the credit facility is also available for the issuance of unsecured letters of credit up to million for our us based reinsurance operation 
simultaneously with the execution of the credit agreement  our former credit agreement expired 
see contractual obligations and commercial commitments letter of credit and revolving credit facilities for a description of the credit agreement 
at december   our capital of billion consisted of senior notes of million  representing of the total  and shareholders equity of billion  representing of the total 
at december   our capital of billion consisted of revolving credit facility borrowings of million  representing of the total  and shareholders equity of billion  representing of the total 
the increase in our capital during of million was primarily attributable to the effects of net income for the year  net proceeds from the march stock offering and the net increase in debt outstanding as a result of the may offering of senior notes 
certain matters which may materially affect our results of operations and or financial condition reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections  at a given point in time  of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of losses incurred 
estimating loss reserves is inherently difficult  which is exacerbated by the fact that we are a relatively new company with relatively limited historical experience upon which to base such estimates 
we utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of loss reserves 
actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid will deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
see the section above entitled critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
premium estimates our premiums written and premiums receivable include estimates for our insurance and reinsurance operations 
insurance premiums written include estimates for program  aviation  construction and surety and collateralized protection business and for participation in involuntary pools 
reinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by the ceding companies  supplemented by our own estimates of premiums for which ceding company reports have not been received 
the basis for the amount of premiums written recognized varies based on the types of contracts we write 
premiums on our excess of loss and pro rata reinsurance contracts are estimated when the business is underwritten 
for excess of loss contracts  the minimum premium  as defined in the contract  is generally recorded as an estimate of premiums written as of the date of the treaty 
estimates of premiums written under pro rata contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by the brokers and the ceding companies 
for multi year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments  only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy 
the remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 
premium estimates are reviewed at least quarterly  based on management s review  comparing actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums together with a review of the aging and collection of premium estimates 
based on management s review  the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated  and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes known 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and such adjustments could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned 
a significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable  which represent estimated premiums written  net of commissions  is not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
based on the above process  management believes that the premium estimates included in premiums receivable will be collectible and  therefore  no provision for doubtful accounts has been recorded on the premium estimates at december  reinsurance protection and recoverables for purposes of limiting our risk of loss  we reinsure a portion of our exposures  paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies we write  and we may also use retrocessional protection 
ceded premiums written represented approximately of gross premiums written for  compared to for and for the availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
although we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have been successful in obtaining reinsurance protection since the commencement of our underwriting initiative in october  it is not certain that we will be able to obtain adequate protection at cost effective levels 
as a result of such market conditions and other factors  we may not be able to successfully mitigate risk through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements 
further  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and retrocessionaires because the ceding of risk to reinsurers and retrocessionaires does not relieve us of our liability to the clients or companies we insure or reinsure 
our failure to establish adequate reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements or the failure of our existing reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements to protect us from overly concentrated risk exposure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place coverages only with substantial  financially sound carriers 
at december   approximately of our reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses of million not including prepaid reinsurance premiums were due from carriers which had an am best rating of a or better 
no reinsurance recoverables from any one carrier exceeded of our total shareholders equity at december  the following table details our reinsurance recoverables at december  of total am best rating alternative market recoverables nr sentry insurance a mutual company a everest reinsurance company a employers reinsurance corporation a swiss reinsurance america corporation a allied world assurance company ltd

an explanation of the ratings listed in the table follows the ratings of a and a are designated superior  the a and a ratings are designated excellent  ratings of b and b are designated very good  the ratings of b and b are designated fair  and the d rating is designated poor 
additionally  am best has five classifications within the not rated or nr category 
reasons for an nr rating being assigned by am best include insufficient data  size or operating experience  companies which are in run off with no active business writings or are dormant  companies which disagree with their rating and request that a rating not be published or insurers that request not to be formally evaluated for the purposes of assigning a rating opinion 
includes amounts recoverable from separate cell accounts in our alternative markets unit 
substantially all of such amounts are collateralized with letters of credit or deposit funds 
in connection with our acquisition of arch specialty insurance company arch specialty in february  the seller  sentry  agreed to reinsure and guarantee all liabilities arising out of arch specialty s business prior to the closing of the acquisition 
in addition to the guarantee provided by sentry  substantially all of the recoverable from sentry is still subject to the original reinsurance agreements inuring to arch specialty and  to the extent sentry fails to comply with its payment obligations to us  we may seek reimbursement from the third party reinsurers under such agreements 
the am best group rating of a excellent has been applied to all lloyd s of london syndicates 
in connection with our acquisition of western diversified casualty insurance company western diversified in june  the seller  protective life corporation  and certain of its affiliates including lyndon property insurance company  agreed to reinsure and guarantee all liabilities arising out of western diversified s business prior to the closing of the acquisition 
the balance due from lyndon property insurance company reflected above includes all such amounts 
the following table provides a breakdown of the all other category by am best rating companies rated a or better companies rated b companies rated b companies rated b companies not rated total natural and man made catastrophic events we have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made catastrophic events 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including  but not limited to  hurricanes  floods  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  severe winter weather and fires 
catastrophes can also cause losses in non property business such as workers compensation or general liability 
in addition to the nature of property business  we believe that economic and geographic trends affecting insured property  including inflation  property value appreciation and geographic concentration  tend to generally increase the size of losses from catastrophic events over time 
we have substantial exposure to unexpected  large losses resulting from future man made catastrophic events  such as acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
these risks are inherently unpredictable and recent events may lead to increased frequency and severity of losses 
it is difficult to predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty or estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate 
it is not possible to eliminate completely our exposure to unforecasted or unpredictable events and  to the extent that losses from such risks occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
therefore  claims for natural and man made catastrophic events could expose us to large losses and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations  which could cause the value of our common shares to fluctuate widely 
in certain instances  we specifically insure and reinsure risks resulting from terrorism 
even in cases where we attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages written by us  we may not be successful in doing so 
moreover  irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language  there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will limit enforceability of policy language or otherwise issue a ruling adverse to us 
we seek to limit our loss exposure by writing a number of our reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis  adhering to maximum limitations on reinsurance written in defined geographical zones  limiting program size for each client and prudent underwriting of each program written 
in the case of proportional treaties  we may seek per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one or series of events 
we cannot be certain that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone s limits 
there can be no assurance that various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  will be enforceable in the manner we intend 
disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise 
underwriting is inherently a matter of judgment  involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control  and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance 
one or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity 
for our natural catastrophe exposed business  we seek to limit the amount of exposure we will assume from any one insured or reinsured and the amount of the exposure to catastrophe losses in any geographic zone 
we monitor our exposure to catastrophic events  including earthquake and wind  and periodically reevaluate the estimated probable maximum pre tax loss for such exposures 
our estimated probable maximum pre tax loss is determined through the use of modeling techniques  but such estimate does not represent our total potential loss for such exposures 
we seek to limit the probable maximum pre tax loss to a specific level for severe catastrophic events 
currently  we generally seek to limit the probable maximum pre tax loss to approximately of total shareholders equity for a severe catastrophic event in any geographic zone that could be expected to occur once in every years 
there can be no assurances that we will not suffer pre tax losses greater than of total shareholders equity from one or more catastrophic events due to several factors  including the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such events and the margin of error in making such determinations resulting from potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques 
in addition  depending on business opportunities and the mix of business that may comprise our insurance and reinsurance portfolio  we may seek to adjust our self imposed limitations on probable maximum pre tax loss for catastrophe exposed business 
acgl has purchased a reinsurance program for its insurance operations which provides coverage for certain property catastrophe related losses equal to a maximum of of the first million in excess of a million retention per occurrence of such losses for  and of the first million in excess of a million retention per occurrence of such losses commencing in as coverage under this reinsurance program is utilized  it is automatically reinstated once and is available under the same terms as described immediately above 
in addition  our reinsurance operations have purchased reinsurance which primarily provides between million and million of coverage in excess of certain deductibles for any one occurrence and million in the aggregate annually  for certain catastrophe related losses worldwide for through april in the future  we may seek to purchase additional catastrophe or other reinsurance protection 
the availability and cost of such reinsurance protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
as a result of market conditions and other factors  we may not be successful in obtaining such protection 
see reinsurance protection and recoverables above 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation we write business on a worldwide basis  and our net income may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as changes in foreign currency exchange rates can reduce our revenues and increase our liabilities and costs 
in order to reduce our exposure to these exchange rate risks  we have invested and expect to continue to invest in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our reinsurance segment invests certain funds in british pounds sterling and euros in order to mitigate the economic effects of foreign currency exchange risk on projected liabilities in such currencies 
we have chosen not to hedge the currency risk on the capital contributed to arch europe in may  which is held in british pounds sterling 
however  we intend to match arch europe s projected liabilities in foreign currencies with investments in the same currencies 
we may suffer losses solely as a result of exchange rate fluctuations 
management and operations as a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company  our success will depend on our ability to integrate new management and operating personnel and to establish and maintain operating procedures and internal controls including the timely and successful implementation of our information technology initiatives  which include the implementation of improved computerized systems and programs to replace or support manual systems to effectively support our business and our regulatory and reporting requirements  and no assurances can be given as to the success of these endeavors  especially in light of the rapid growth of our business 
accordingly  we have been  and are continuing to  enhance our procedures and controls  including our controls over financial reporting 
shareholders agreement the warburg pincus funds and the hellman friedman funds together control a majority of our voting power on a fully diluted basis and have the right to nominate a majority of directors to our board under the shareholders agreement entered into in connection with the november capital infusion 
the shareholders agreement also provides that we cannot engage in certain transactions prior to november  outside the ordinary course of our business  including mergers and acquisitions and transactions in excess of certain amounts  without the consent of a designee of the warburg pincus funds and a designee of the hellman friedman funds 
these provisions could have an effect on the operation of our business and  to the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts  they could deprive our shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price of our common shares 
by reason of their ownership and the shareholders agreement  the warburg pincus funds and the hellman friedman funds are able to strongly influence or effectively control actions to be taken by us 
the interests of these shareholders may differ materially from the interests of the holders of our common shares  and these shareholders could take actions that are not in the interests of the holders of our common shares 
contingencies relating to the sale of prior reinsurance operations see note  commitments and contingencies folksamerica transaction and related contingencies  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
industry and ratings we operate in a highly competitive environment  and since the september  events  new capital has entered the market 
these factors may mitigate the benefits that the financial markets may perceive for the property and casualty insurance industry  and we cannot offer any assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our industry or that the intensity of competition in our industry will not erode profitability and result in less favorable terms and conditions for insurance and reinsurance companies generally  including us 
in addition  we can offer no assurances that we will participate at all or to the same extent as more established or other companies in any price increases or increased profitability in our industry 
if we do not share in such price increases or increased profitability  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
financial strength and claims paying ratings from third party rating agencies are instrumental in establishing the competitive positions of companies in our industry 
periodically  rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet their criteria for the ratings assigned to us by them 
our reinsurance subsidiaries  arch reinsurance company and arch re bermuda  and our principal insurance subsidiaries  arch insurance company  arch excess surplus insurance company  arch specialty and arch europe  each currently has a financial strength rating of a excellent from am best 
the a rating is the fourth highest out of fifteen ratings assigned by am best

standard poor s rating services assigned counterparty issuer credit and senior debt ratings of bbb to acgl 
a counterparty credit rating provides an opinion on an issuer s overall capacity and willingness to meet its financial commitments as they become due  but is not specific to a particular financial obligation  and acgl s senior debt rating relates to its year senior notes issued in may the bbb rating assigned to acgl by standard poor s for its counterparty credit rating and its senior debt rating is the fourth highest out of eight ratings and fourth highest out of ten ratings  respectively  assigned by standard poor s 
these ratings are statements of opinion  not statements of fact and not recommendations to buy  hold or sell any securities 
rating agencies have been coming under increasing pressure as a result of high profile corporate bankruptcies and may  as a result  increase their scrutiny of rated companies  revise their rating policies or take other action 
we can offer no assurances that our ratings will remain at their current levels  or that our security will be accepted by brokers and our insureds and reinsureds 
a ratings downgrade or the potential for such a downgrade  or failure to obtain a necessary rating  could adversely affect both our relationships with agents  brokers  wholesalers and other distributors of our existing products and services and new sales of our products and services 
in addition  under certain of the reinsurance agreements assumed by our reinsurance operations  upon the occurrence of a ratings downgrade or other specified triggering event with respect to our reinsurance operations  such as a reduction in surplus by specified amounts during specified periods  our ceding company clients may be provided with certain rights  including  among other things  the right to terminate the subject reinsurance agreement and or to require that our reinsurance operations post additional collateral 
in the event of a ratings downgrade or other triggering event  the exercise of such contract rights by our clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  as well as our ongoing business and operations 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments letter of credit and revolving credit facilities on september   we entered into a three year agreement credit agreement for a million unsecured revolving loan and letter of credit facility and a million secured letter of credit facility 
letters of credit were issued under the credit agreement on september  borrowings of revolving loans may be made by acgl and arch re us at a variable rate based on libor or an alternative base rate at our option 
the million unsecured revolving loan is also available for the issuance of unsecured letters of credit up to million for arch re us secured letters of credit are available for issuance on behalf of arch re us  arch insurance  arch specialty  arch e s and western diversified 
the credit agreement replaced our former credit agreement  dated as of september  and amended as of september   which provided for unsecured borrowings of up to million 
we used million of the net proceeds from the offering of senior notes in may see senior notes below to repay all amounts outstanding on the former credit agreement 
simultaneously with the execution of the credit agreement  the former credit agreement expired 
issuance of letters of credit and borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to our compliance with certain covenants and conditions  including absence of a material adverse change 
these covenants require  among other things  that we maintain a debt to shareholders equity ratio of not greater than to and shareholders equity in excess of billion plus of future aggregate net income beginning after september  not including any future net losses and of future aggregate proceeds from the issuance of common or preferred equity  that we maintain minimum unencumbered cash and investment grade securities in the amount of million and that our principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries maintain at least a b rating from am best 
in addition  certain of our subsidiaries which are parties to the credit agreement are required to maintain minimum shareholders equity levels 
we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreement at december  the credit agreement expires in september including the secured letter of credit portion of the credit agreement and another letter of credit facility together  the loc facilities  we have access to secured letter of credit facilities for up to a total of million 
the principal purpose of the loc facilities is to issue  as required  evergreen standby letters of credit in favor of primary insurance or reinsurance counterparties with which we have entered into reinsurance arrangements to ensure that such counterparties are permitted to take credit for reinsurance obtained from our reinsurance subsidiaries in united states jurisdictions where such subsidiaries are not licensed or otherwise admitted as an insurer  as required under insurance regulations in the united states  and to comply with requirements of lloyd s of london in connection with qualifying quota share and other arrangements 
the amount of letters of credit issued is driven by  among other things  the timing and payment of catastrophe losses  loss development of existing reserves  the payment pattern of such reserves  the further expansion of our business and the loss experience of such business 
when issued  such letters of credit are secured by a portion of our investment portfolio 
in addition  the loc facilities also require the maintenance of certain covenants  which we were in compliance with at december  at such date  we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit under the loc facilities  which were secured by investments totaling million 
the other letter of credit facility expires in december it is anticipated that the loc facilities will be renewed or replaced on expiry  but such renewal or replacement will be subject to the availability of credit from banks which we utilize 
in addition to letters of credit  we have and may establish insurance trust accounts in the us and canada to secure its reinsurance amounts payable as required 
at december   cad million had been set aside in canadian trust accounts 
senior notes in may  acgl completed a public offering of million principal amount of senior notes senior notes due may  and received net proceeds of million 
acgl will pay interest on the senior notes on may and november of each year 
the first such payment was made on november  acgl may redeem the senior notes at any time and from time to time  in whole or in part  at a make whole redemption price 
the senior notes are acgl s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of its existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness 
the effective interest rate related to the senior notes  based on the net proceeds received  is approximately 
acgl used million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay all amounts outstanding under a revolving credit agreement and the remaining proceeds were used to support the underwriting activities of its insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes 
contractual obligations the following table provides an analysis of our contractual commitments at december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years us dollars in thousands long term debt obligations   operating lease obligations     purchase obligations      reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net  deposit accounting liabilities    total      the estimated expected contractual commitments related to the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are presented net of reinsurance recoverables 
it should be noted that until a claim has been presented to us  determined to be valid  quantified and settled  there is no known obligation on an individual transaction basis  and while estimable in the aggregate  the timing and amount contain significant uncertainty 
approximately of our reserves were incurred but not reported 
the estimated expected contractual commitments related to deposit accounting liabilities have been estimated using projected cash flows from the underlying contracts 
it should be noted that  due to the nature of such liabilities  the timing and amount contain significant uncertainty 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not party to any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
we concluded that  under fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued and became effective for us during the first quarter  we are required to consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations if any of a certain managing general agency in which one of our subsidiaries has an investment 
such agency ceased producing business in and is currently running off its operations 
based on current information  there are no assets or liabilities of such agency required to be reflected on the face of our consolidated financial statements that are not  or have not been previously  otherwise reflected therein 
therefore  we believe that the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as of or for the year ended december  investments the finance and investment committee of our board of directors establishes our investment policies and creates guidelines for our external investment managers 
the finance and investment committee reviews the implementation of the investment strategy on a regular basis 
our current approach stresses preservation of capital  market liquidity and diversification of risk 
our consolidated cash and invested assets were as follows at december  and december  us dollars in thousands fixed maturities available for sale  at fair value  short term investments available for sale  at fair value  cash   privately held securities   total   at december  and  our fixed income portfolio  which includes fixed maturity securities and short term investments  had an average effective duration of years and years  respectively  an average standard poor s quality rating of aa and an average yield to maturity book yield of and  respectively 
at december  and  our invested assets did not include any publicly traded equity securities  however  primarily for portfolio diversification purposes  we expect to allocate a portion of our portfolio to equity securities in future periods 
each quarter  we review our investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
our process for identifying if declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors 
these factors include i the time period in which there has been a significant decline in value  ii an analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  iii the significance of the decline and iv our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover 
where our analysis of the above factors results in the conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary  the cost of the securities is written down to fair value and is reflected as a realized loss 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus regarding eitf  which provides guidance for evaluating whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and was effective beginning with the third quarter 
in october  the fasb issued a final fasb staff position that delayed the effective date of the application guidance on impairment of securities that is included in paragraphs through of eitf the annual disclosure requirements under paragraphs through of eitf have not been deferred 
we are currently awaiting updated guidance from the eitf in order to be able to evaluate the impact that eitf may have on our consolidated financial statements 
the delay in the effective date for the application guidance is not a suspension of currently existing accounting requirements for assessing other than temporary impairments for securities under sfas no 
or other current accounting standards  including current guidance for cost method and equity method investments
