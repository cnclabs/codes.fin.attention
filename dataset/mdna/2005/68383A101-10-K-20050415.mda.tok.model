item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly in risk factors 
see also cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
the consolidated financial statements and related information contained in this annual report on form k reflect our results as they existed for the fiscal year ended january  overview we are a provider of it automation software for enterprises  government agencies and service providers seeking to reduce the cost and improve the quality of it operations 
in this annual report  we refer to this business as our software business 
our software products include the opsware server automation system osas  the opsware network automation system onas and the opsware asset management system oams 
our software products automate it operations across servers  software  applications and network devices and discover and track assets across the it environment 
osas automates key server  software and application operations 
onas automates network device operations for large data centers and remote locations 
oams enables it organizations to discover it hardware and software assets  track these assets on an ongoing basis and reduce costs of excess hardware and software purchases  unnecessary maintenance renewals  and underutilization of idle and redundant assets 
our software products automate formerly manual  time consuming and error prone tasks  including the provisioning  changing  auditing  patching  reporting  configuring  scaling  securing and recovering of servers  software  business applications and network devices 
prior to august fiscal year ending january  we primarily provided managed internet services for corporations and government agencies operating mission critical internet applications 
we referred to this business as our managed services business 
we used our proprietary opsware automation technology in the managed services business  and have since integrated this technology into our software products 
in august  we sold our managed services business to eds for a total purchase price of million in cash pursuant to an asset purchase agreement 
at the time that we entered into the asset purchase agreement  we also entered into a separate license and maintenance agreement with eds pursuant to which we granted eds a license whereby eds has certain rights to use our software products 
under the license and maintenance agreement  eds agreed to pay us a minimum license and maintenance fee of million in the aggregate over a term of three years 
the obligation of eds to pay us was subject to our development of specified features and functions  which we delivered to eds and for which we received acceptance from eds during the quarter ended april in august  we entered into an amendment of our license and maintenance agreement with eds whereby eds agreed to extend the term of the agreement through march and committed to pay minimum additional license and maintenance fees of approximately million over the term of the extended license 
these payments are in addition to the previous million commitment eds initially made in august pursuant to our amendment of the license and maintenance agreement with eds  the term of the original agreement was extended through march  eds is required to pay million per month from august  through august  and  per month thereafter through march  eds monthly payments are no longer dependent upon the number of devices being managed by our software products  eds receives rights to license all future products released by us  when and if available for commercial release  for no additional fee  we agreed to provide certain third party equipment and software for eds use in connection with our software products  and dedicated opsware support personnel will continue to be provided to eds 
table of contents for the duration of the extended term 
following the extended term  the agreement will automatically renew at a fee of  per month for five successive one year terms unless terminated in advance by eds 
revenue under this arrangement will continue to be recognized based on the lesser of ratably or when monthly payments become due over the extended term of the amended agreement 
in october  we entered into a second amendment of the license and maintenance agreement with eds pursuant to which we provided eds with million for their purchase of computer equipment required to support their planned deployment of our software products within eds facilities 
as a result of this amendment  we have no further obligation to provide any equipment to eds 
accordingly  the amounts paid to eds pursuant to this second amendment have been charged to cost of sales as a contract acquisition cost 
we expect that our operating results will continue to be largely dependent on our relationship with eds for the foreseeable future 
in our software business  we derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales of software licenses 
we sell our products principally through our direct sales force and intend to develop additional indirect channels with corporate partners  such as distributors  value added resellers  hardware providers and systems integrators 
we also derive revenue from sales of annual support and maintenance agreements and professional services 
in fiscal and  and of our revenues came from our license and maintenance agreement with eds  respectively 
our revenues from these services prior to fiscal were insignificant because fiscal was our first full year in our software business 
we have various strategic relationships with other technology companies in order to distribute our products and services 
for example  in september  we entered into a software distribution license agreement with nec pursuant to which nec may use  market  sell  and support our software products in japan 
nec intends to sell our software products in connection with its valumo platform technology  as both a standalone product or integrated with other valumo products that support mission critical systems 
in january  we entered into an amendment of our software distribution license agreement with nec to enable nec to utilize osas for its internal use 
in february  we completed our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of tangram enterprise solutions  inc to extend our product offerings and technology capabilities  expand our customer base and increase research and development opportunities 
the purchase price of the acquisition was million  consisting of million of our common stock  or approximately million shares  and approximately million of direct acquisition costs 
see note  acquisition of tangram in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  we entered into a settlement agreement with qwest regarding disputes with qwest concerning the amended and restated ethernet collocation internet access service agreement  amended and restated reseller agreement and confidentiality agreement that we entered into with qwest in fiscal in connection with the settlement  we paid million to qwest and transferred ownership of certain items of equipment to qwest  with an aggregate fair market value of approximately  in addition  the parties reserved from the settlement any claims either party may have under the guaranteed term agreement between the parties  up to an aggregate maximum of  as a result of the settlement  we reversed approximately million of previously accrued data center facility costs and recognized a gain on sale of assets and liabilities from managed services business in the consolidated statements of operations for the period ended april  on february   we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of rendition networks  inc  a provider of network device automation software located in redmond  washington

table of contents restructuring activities in august  we announced a restructuring program in connection with the closing of the sale of our managed services business to eds 
the restructuring program was accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  sfas 
the restructuring program included a provision for the future lease rentals on vacated facilities located in sunnyvale  california  and a provision for impairment to property and equipment due to the decision to restructure the operations 
the net lease payments to be paid on the vacated facilities were computed based on management s estimates of its ability to sublease excess facilities based on prevailing real estate market conditions at that time 
as a result  we recorded restructuring charges of million as a component of our operating expenses 
in accordance with sfas  during fiscal we recorded adjustments to the restructuring charge of approximately  for a decrease in estimated sublease income  a recovery related to the impairment on the property and equipment  present value adjustments for the remaining payments related to two lease amendments for which we paid a portion or all of the remaining lease obligation as described below and the recovery sublease payments received

this resulted in a reduction of our restructuring liability related to the closing of the sale of our managed services business of approximately million and a recovery of approximately  resulting from the adjustment to the present value of the remaining payments included in the original restructuring charge 
in october  we entered into an agreement to amend the facility lease with respect to a vacated facility located in sunnyvale  california which was included in the august restructuring program in connection with the sale of the managed services business 
pursuant to the agreement  we paid the remaining rent amount of million in one lump sum rather than on a continuing monthly basis over the term of the lease 
this resulted in an additional restructuring charge of approximately  which represents the difference between the present value of the remaining payments included in the original restructuring charge and the lump sum payment 
in may  we amended our agreement with our subtenant with respect to our facility located in sunnyvale  california 
pursuant to the amendment  the term of the sublease was increased  resulting in additional probable future sublease payments 
as a result  we revised our estimates of the fair value computed as the revised present value of the future net lease payments on vacated leased facilities of our restructuring liability as of july   resulting in a reduction to the recorded restructuring liability and a restructuring recovery of approximately  in addition  we recorded a recovery of restructuring charges for excess facilities of approximately  during the fiscal year ended january  due to sublease payments received 
we also recorded a recovery due to the settlement of a sublease agreement of approximately  during the three months ended july  the sublease payments were not included in the calculation of the original restructuring charge due to the uncertainty of the financial condition of the subtenant

property taxes had been included in the original restructuring calculation

commitments as of january   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases for facilities 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years greater than years operating leases  net of subleases as a result of our acquisition of rendition networks in february  we now occupy a facility in redmond  washington  under a lease that terminates june  at  per month 
we expect to renew this lease 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
we believe that our current cash balances  including cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
nevertheless  we may seek additional capital through the issuance of public and or private equity if the market permits  equipment lease facilities  bank financings or arrangements with strategic partners to expand our business 
capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  costs of providing our products and services  the timing and extent of research and development projects and increases in our operating expenses 
to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents balances and any cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available if necessary or available on reasonable terms 
we may from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  services  products and technologies  which could increase our capital requirements 
for example  in february  we completed the acquisition of rendition networks  inc  and paid million in cash as part of the acquisition price 
critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  our estimates may change based upon changed circumstances and as we reassess our underlying assumptions from time to time 
the securities and exchange commission has described the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  which affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
no customer has a right of return privilege 
we generate revenue from the sale of our software licenses and services  including revenue from maintenance and support agreements and professional service agreements 
to date  the majority of our revenue has been recognized ratably over the remaining post contract support maintenance obligation period after deployment and completion of all elements of the arrangement because we have not established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of maintenance of osas 
revenue from the sale of osas software licenses is comprised of fees for multi year or perpetual licenses  which are derived from contracts with customers 
for perpetual licenses  until we establish vsoe of fair value for maintenance  the license  maintenance and professional services revenue is recognized ratably over the remaining maintenance period once all elements except maintenance have been delivered 
for term licenses accompanied by maintenance  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the term of the license period 
once we establish vsoe of fair value for maintenance  we will recognize perpetual license revenue based upon the residual method after all elements other than maintenance and non essential professional services have been delivered with consideration to individual contract terms and conditions and as prescribed by sop we will then recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
in accordance with paragraph of sop  vsoe of fair value for maintenance is determined by reference to the price charged to the customer for maintenance when it is sold separately that is  the renewal rate 
customers that enter into license agreements where maintenance for the initial twelve months is included in the license fee  generally have the ability to renew the maintenance contract for an additional one year term at the renewal rate that is  the price for maintenance when sold separately 
maintenance contracts are generally one year in duration 
see note  transactions with eds in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the treatment of revenue recognition in connection with the amended license and maintenance agreement with eds 
in the case of oams software  for which we have established vsoe of fair value for maintenance  we recognize perpetual license revenue based upon the residual method after all elements other than maintenance have been delivered  provided that all of the criteria for revenue recognition discussed above are met 
generally  these criteria are met at the time of delivery 
for software arrangements involving multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element is based on vsoe for that element 
we establish vsoe based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if vsoe of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized based on the residual method 
services revenue consists of revenue from maintenance and support agreements and professional services arrangements 
in all cases  we assess whether the service element of the arrangement is essential to the functionality of any other elements of the arrangement 
currently  when services excluding maintenance and support services  are considered essential to the arrangement  the service revenue fee is recognized ratably over the remaining maintenance period once the services are completed and delivered  as we do not have vsoe of fair value for maintenance for osas 
in the case of pre packaged software for which we have established vsoe for the fair value of maintenance  and if we establish vsoe of fair value for maintenance for osas and services are considered essential or the arrangement involves customization or modification of our software and there 
table of contents exists reliable estimates for the costs and efforts necessary to complete the services  then both the license and services excluding maintenance and support revenue under the arrangement would be recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting based upon input measures of costs 
if such estimates are not available  the completed contract method would be utilized 
when an arrangement includes contractual milestones  we recognize revenue as such milestones are achieved provided the milestones are not subject to any additional acceptance criteria 
for those arrangements where we have concluded that the services element is not essential to the other elements of the arrangement  we then determine whether the services are available from other vendors  the services do not involve a significant degree of risk or unique acceptance criteria and we are able to provide the service in order to separately account for the services revenue 
when the services qualify for separate accounting  we use vsoe of fair value for the services and maintenance  if available  to account for the arrangement using the residual method  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
revenue allocable to services is recognized as the services are performed 
if however  we do not have vsoe of fair value of the non essential services  such services are provided under an arrangement along with software and maintenance  and the non essential services are expected to be performed over the course of the maintenance period  upon delivery of our software and any essential service  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the remaining maintenance period 
in the case of pre packaged software for which we have established vsoe of fair value for maintenance  we recognize revenue for maintenance using the straight line method over the period that the maintenance is provided  generally one year 
revenue from training arrangements or seminars and from consulting services is recognized as the services are performed or seminars are held 
vsoe of fair value of professional services is based upon hourly or daily rates 
we enter into stand alone contracts for professional services and these contracts provide for payment upon a time and materials basis 
the hourly or daily rates associated with these contracts are used to assess the vsoe of fair value of professional services in multi element arrangements 
we recognize revenue associated with software licenses and services sold to distributors  system integrators and value added resellers collectively resellers upon satisfaction of all revenue recognition criteria unless we are aware that a reseller does not have a purchase order or other contractual agreement from an end user 
in connection with sales to resellers  there is no right of return or price protection 
if we have not met the criteria for revenue recognition  we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria are met 
if we have not met the criteria for revenue recognition and have received cash from a customer  the amounts received are included in advances from customers 
if we have met the criteria for revenue recognition  whether or not we have received cash from a customer  the amounts billed are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the period services are provided 
on february   we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of rendition networks  inc therefore  the financial statements do not include any revenue from onas software 
impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets 
we continually review the carrying value of long lived assets  including property and equipment and other identified intangible assets  to determine whether there are any indications of impairment 
some indicators of impairment include but are not limited to  a decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  an adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses 
according to our accounting policy  when such indicators are present  if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from operations from those long lived assets are less than the carrying value of those long lived assets  we compare the fair value of the assets estimated using discounted future net cash flows to be generated from the lowest common level of operations utilizing the assets to the carrying value of the long lived assets to determine 
table of contents any impairment charges 
we reduce the carrying value of the long lived assets if the carrying value of the long lived assets is greater than their fair value 
the new carrying value is then depreciated over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets 
the determination as to whether impairment exists involves significant judgment and the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows reflects management s best estimates 
impairment of goodwill 
we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill will not be amortized  but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if certain indicators are present 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition and loss of key personnel 
the assessment of impairment is made by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned by management to its carrying value 
to the extent that an impairment is indicated fair value is less than carrying value  we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on the short term and long term projections of future performance 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows  including the discount rate used and estimated terminal value  reflects management s best estimates 
in the event we determine that goodwill has been impaired  we will incur an accounting charge related to the impairment during the fiscal quarter in which such impairment determination is made 
we review for indicators of potential impairment of goodwill annually 
restructuring costs 
during fiscal and  we restructured our business under plans approved by the board of directors by reducing our headcount  consolidating our facilities and disposing of excess and obsolete property and equipment 
as a result of these actions  we recorded restructuring and other related charges consisting of cash severance payments to be made to severed employees and lease payments related to property abandoned as a result of our facilities consolidation  net of estimated sublease income 
our estimates include the review of the financial condition of our existing sublessees as well as the state of the regional real estate markets 
each reporting period  we review these estimates based on the status of execution of our restructuring plan and  to the extent that these assumptions change due to changes in market conditions and our business  the ultimate restructuring expenses could vary by material amounts  and result in additional expenses or the recovery of amounts previously recorded 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
a key provision of this statement is the requirement of a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments including stock options based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognized over the vesting period 
sfas r will be effective for our fiscal quarter beginning february   and requires the use of either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective application method 
under the modified prospective method  sfas r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
compensation cost for the portion of awards for which service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining services are rendered 
if the modified retrospective method is applied  financial statements for prior periods shall be adjusted to give effect to the fair value based method of accounting for awards on a consistent basis with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods under the original sfas we will be adopting the modified prospective method of accounting for sfas r 
we have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of sfas r on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
we have limited experience operating our software business  which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects 
as a result of the sale of our managed services business to eds in fiscal  our business model has shifted from providing managed internet services to primarily licensing our software products 
we have limited experience operating our software business 
as a result  we have limited ability to forecast future demand for our products and there is limited financial data upon which you may evaluate our business and prospects 
in addition  we have acquired existing businesses and a suite of software products from these businesses in order to address additional aspects of the it automation market 
we have limited experience operating these acquired businesses as well 
our potential for future profitability must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
in addition  our future prospects may be hindered by our relative lack of experience in operating our own business and any businesses that we may acquire to augment our core business 
some of these risks relate to our potential inability to sign contracts with and deploy our products to a sufficient number of customers  particularly in light of current unfavorable economic conditions  provide high levels of support for our products and support the deployment of a higher volume of our products  deploy our products in the time frame we anticipate in order to meet our revenue forecasts  develop new product offerings and extend the functionality of our existing technologies  develop and extend our software products to support a wide range of hardware and software to meet the diverse needs of customers  integrate acquired businesses and technologies  develop effective direct sales and reseller channels to sell our software product lines  develop additional strategic partnerships to facilitate our ability to market and sell our software products  develop the capability that permits our software products to be integrated with the variety of existing management systems that customers may already have deployed  and establish awareness of our brand 
if we do not successfully address these risks  we may not realize sufficient revenue to reach or sustain profitability 
our financial results may fluctuate significantly  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenue and operating results could vary significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly or decline 
important factors that could cause our quarterly and annual financial results to fluctuate materially include our ability to obtain new customers and retain existing customers  the limited number of deals we expect to close each quarter for the foreseeable future  the timing of signing and deploying contracts with new and existing customers  
table of contents the timing and magnitude of operating expenses and capital expenditures  the effect of any non cash compensation charges in connection with the issuance  cancellation or modification of stock option awards  the timing of our satisfaction of revenue recognition criteria  including the establishment of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance  costs related to the various third party technologies we may incorporate into our technology and services  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  any downturn in our customers and potential customers businesses  the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or by our competitors  and changes in the mix of revenue attributable to higher margin software products versus lower margin integration and support services 
our current and future levels of operating expenses and capital expenditures are based to an extent on our growth plans and estimates of future revenue 
these expenditure levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  and any significant shortfall in revenue relative to planned expenditures could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
due to these and other factors  period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one period as an indication of our future performance 
in future periods  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
our operating results are and will continue to be highly dependent upon our relationship with eds and any deterioration of our relationship with eds could adversely affect the success of our software business 
our operating results are largely dependent on our relationship with eds and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future 
in  we entered into a three year  million license and maintenance agreement with eds 
in august  we entered into an amendment of our license and maintenance agreement with eds whereby eds agreed to extend the term of the agreement through march and committed to pay minimum additional license and maintenance fees of approximately million over the term of the extended license 
for the fiscal year ended january   eds accounted for of our net revenue 
as of january   eds accounted for of our accounts receivable balance 
if our relationship with eds were to deteriorate  our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 
in addition  if eds financial position were to deteriorate  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
although we extended our license and maintenance agreement with eds through march  we cannot assure you that eds will renew the license beyond the extended term or that if eds does renew the license beyond the extended term  it will do so on the terms contemplated in the agreement 
whether or not eds continues to license our software may depend  in large part  on its level of customer satisfaction 
in addition  we cannot assure you that eds will achieve the benefits they expect from our software products or that they will be able to continue to deploy our software successfully or in the time frames contemplated by the license agreement 
each of these factors may affect eds willingness to renew the license 
if eds does not renew the license  our business and operating results may be adversely affected and this may negatively impact our reputation and our ability to license our software products to other customers 
in addition to these risks  the occurrence of any of the adverse events discussed elsewhere in these risk factors could negatively impact our relationship with eds and  consequently  our business 

table of contents the it automation software market is relatively new  and our business will suffer if the market does not develop as we expect 
the market for our products and services is relatively new and may not grow or be sustainable 
potential customers may choose not to purchase automation software from a third party provider due to concerns about security  reliability  vendor stability and viability  cost or system compatibility 
it is possible that our products may never achieve broad market acceptance 
we will incur operating expenses based to an extent on anticipated revenue trends that are difficult to predict given the recent emergence of the information technology automation software market 
if this market does not develop  or develops more slowly than we expect  we may not achieve significant market acceptance for our software  our rate of revenue growth may be constrained and our operating results may suffer 
in addition  implementation of our products may be difficult  costly and time consuming 
customers could become dissatisfied with our products if implementation requires more time  expense or personnel than they expected 
additionally  we may be unable or choose not to bill our customers for the time and expenses incurred in connection with these implementation issues  which would adversely affect our operating results 
as part of the implementation  our products must integrate with many of our customers existing computer systems and software programs  which can also be time consuming and expensive and could lead to customer dissatisfaction and increased expenses 
we have also joined together with a number of other technology companies in connection with the establishment of the data center mark up language dcml standard within the data center environment 
we cannot assure you that the dcml standard will become widely accepted or result in any benefits to our business 
the rates we charge our customers for our software products may decline over time or we may choose to amend those rates to better achieve our business objectives  which could reduce our revenue and affect our financial results 
as our business model attracts the attention of competitors  we may experience pressure to decrease the fees we charge for our software products  which could adversely affect our revenue and our gross margins 
if we are unable to sell our software at acceptable prices  or if we fail to offer additional products with sufficient profit margins  our revenue growth could slow  our margins may not improve and our business and financial results could suffer 
in addition  we may choose to amend existing customer contracts or enter into new contracts with existing customers to better achieve our business objectives  and any such amendments or new contracts could affect the manner in which we report our results of operations as well as the historical accounting treatment for any such contracts 
we must satisfy the criteria for revenue recognition in order to recognize the fees generated under our license agreements as revenue 
in order to recognize the fees generated under our license agreements as revenue  we must demonstrate that the license arrangement satisfies the criteria for revenue recognition including that persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
if we are unable to satisfy the criteria for revenue recognition  our operating results may suffer or may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in addition  the timing of our recognition of revenue will depend upon the mix of revenue that is recognized under the residual method  pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop and sop  under the percentage of completion or completed contract method of accounting  pursuant to sop  under the ratable method  or in connection with multi year licenses  as well as the timing of our establishment of vsoe of fair value for maintenance 
in addition  we may not establish vsoe of fair value for maintenance for osas in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  if we do not establish vsoe of fair value for maintenance for osas we will recognize license  maintenance and professional services revenues ratably over 
table of contents the maintenance period 
to date  the vast majority of our revenue from the sale of enterprise software has been recognized ratably over the remaining maintenance period after deployment of the software and we have not established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance for osas 
sales of our products to enterprises  government agencies and service providers involve lengthy sales and deployment cycles  which may cause our financial results to suffer 
we focus our sales efforts on enterprises  government agencies and service providers 
sales of our products to these entities generally involve a long sales cycle 
the length of the average sales cycle could make it more difficult for us to predict revenue and plan expenditures accordingly 
the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our products is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control  such as customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance procedures  our lack of customer references due to our limited number of customers and limited experience operating our software business  concerns about the introduction or announcement of our or our competitors new products  and potential downturns in the it market and in economic conditions generally 
in addition  the time it takes to demonstrate and deploy our software with these accounts may be longer than a non enterprise customer given the complexity of their operations  which may delay our ability to recognize revenue from sales to these accounts and may affect customer satisfaction 
as we develop our software products  we may continue to incur significant operating losses  and we may never be profitable 
we may be required to spend significant funds to continue developing our software products  and to expand research and development and sales and marketing organizations to fit the needs of our software business 
we have incurred significant operating and net losses and negative cash flow in the past and have not achieved operating profitability 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to experience operating losses for the foreseeable future 
to achieve operating profitability  we will need to maintain and expand the customer base for our software 
however  we may not be able to increase our revenue or increase our operating efficiencies as planned 
if our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses increase by more than we expect  our cash flow and operating results will suffer 
consequently  it is possible that we will never achieve operating profitability 
even if we do achieve positive cash flow or profitability in any one quarter  we may not sustain or increase positive cash flow or profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
in addition  any decision to restructure our operations  to exit any activity or to eliminate any excess capacity could result in significant accounting charges 
these restructuring charges could also result from future business combinations 
restructuring charges  individually or in aggregate  could create losses in future periods 
our revenue and operating results will be highly dependent upon our ability to provide high levels of customer satisfaction 
our business depends upon the level of our customers satisfaction with our products and services 
these levels of satisfaction will depend in large part upon our ability to successfully deploy and support our products within our customers environments consistent with their expectations of the capabilities and benefits of our products 
we provide technical support to our customers pursuant to contracts that are generally renewable annually 

table of contents our customers willingness to renew their maintenance and support agreements  enter into new contracts for additional products  and act as a reference account will depend in large part on our ability to provide high levels of customer service 
if we fail to provide the level of support demanded by our customers or if the capabilities of our products do not match our customers expectations  they may not renew their maintenance and support agreements or enter into new contracts for additional products and may not act as a reference account  each of which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating results 
we may engage in additional acquisitions or investments  which may place a strain on our resources  cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our operating results 
from time to time we may make acquisitions of or investments in other companies in an effort to increase our customer base  broaden our product offerings or expand our technology platform 
for example  in february  we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of tangram enterprise solutions  inc  a software and services provider located in north carolina 
in addition  in february  we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of rendition networks  inc  a network device automation company located in redmond  washington 
if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments successfully  they may seriously harm our business 
we may not realize any benefit from any acquisitions  including the acquisitions of tangram and rendition networks  if we are unable to do the following effectively market and sell the newly acquired products  effectively provide services to any newly acquired customers  properly evaluate the technology acquired  accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction  including but not limited to  accounting charges related to the impairment of assets acquired and transaction expenses  manage the expenses of the acquired business  integrate and retain personnel  manage geographically dispersed operations  address unforeseen liabilities or risks associated with the acquired company  combine potentially different corporate cultures  and effectively integrate services and products as well as technology  sales  marketing and support operations 
if we fail to do any of these  we may suffer losses  our resources may become strained and or our management s attention may be diverted from other important business concerns 
we may lose key employees while integrating new organizations 
acquisitions could result in customer dissatisfaction  performance problems with an acquired company and its technology  contingent liabilities or possible impairment charges  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  if we conduct acquisitions using convertible debt or equity securities  our existing stockholders will experience dilution in their investment 
the market for our technology and services is competitive and we may not have the resources required to compete effectively 
the market for our technology is relatively new and therefore subject to rapid and significant change and we cannot assure you of the success of our strategy going forward 
our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than our software  which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories  more developed infrastructures  greater brand recognition  international presence and more established relationships in the industry than we have  each of 
table of contents which may allow them to gain greater market share 
as a result  some of our competitors may be able to develop and expand their technology offerings more rapidly  adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly  take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily  achieve greater economies of scale  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their technology and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can 
some of our competitors have lower priced offerings and offer solutions that may be easier to sell and demonstrate to prospective customers 
in addition  certain large competitors may be able to distribute their software products at minimal cost or free of charge to customers 
furthermore  the open source community may develop competing software products which could erode our market share and force us to lower our prices 
our competitors include large software and systems companies as well as small publicly traded and privately held companies 
because some of our current competitors have pre existing relationships with our current and potential customers  we might not be able to achieve sufficient market penetration to achieve or sustain profitability 
these existing relationships can also make it difficult for us to obtain additional customers due to the substantial investment that these potential customers might have already made based on our competitors technology 
furthermore  our competitors may be able to devote substantial resources aimed at preventing us from establishing or enhancing our customer relationships 
our competitors and other companies may form strategic relationships with each other to compete with us 
these relationships may take the form of strategic investments  joint marketing agreements  licenses or other contractual arrangements  any of which may increase our competitors ability to address customer needs with their product offerings 
our competitors and other companies may consolidate with one another or acquire other technology providers  enabling them to offer a broader array of products and more effectively compete with us 
this consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that could impede our ability to compete successfully and harm our business 
in addition  to the extent that we seek to expand our product lines  managerial and technical personnel skills and capacity through acquisitions  the trend in the software industry toward consolidation may result in our encountering competition  and paying higher prices  for acquired businesses 
our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
we are subject to rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec and nasdaq  have recently issued new requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to recent laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of in particular  we are providing  beginning with this annual report on form k  an annual report on our internal control over financial reporting  and obtaining an auditor s attestation with respect to our report  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed 
our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
any failure to timely implement the reforms required by these new laws and regulations could significantly harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
unfavorable economic conditions and reductions in information technology spending could limit our ability to grow our business 
our business and operating results are subject to the effects of changes in general economic conditions and changes in the information technology market 
in addition  fears of continued global recession  war and acts of 
table of contents terrorism may continue to impact global economies negatively 
we believe that the current economic conditions  as well as the recent decline in worldwide economic conditions  have led to reduced it spending 
if these conditions worsen  demand for our products may be reduced 
our management is required to make forecasts with respect to economic trends and general business conditions in order to develop budgets  plan research and development strategies and perform a wide variety of general management functions 
to the extent that our forecasts are incorrect  our performance may suffer because of a failure to properly align our corporate strategy with economic conditions 
if we do not develop our direct sales organization  we will have difficulty acquiring customers 
our products require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at a limited number of key people within our prospective customers organizations 
because the market for our technology and services is new  many prospective customers are unfamiliar with the products we offer 
as a result  our sales effort requires highly trained sales personnel 
we may need to expand our sales organization in order to increase market awareness of our products to a greater number of organizations and  in turn  to generate increased revenue 
we are in the process of developing our direct sales force  and we may require additional qualified sales personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to hire the type and number of sales personnel we need 
moreover  even after we hire these individuals  they require extensive training and time to become productive 
if we decide  but are unable  to expand our direct sales force and train new sales personnel as rapidly as necessary  we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our products  which may prevent us from growing our revenue and achieving and maintaining profitability 
future changes in accounting standards or our interpretation of current standards  particularly changes affecting revenue recognition  could cause unexpected fluctuations in reported revenue 
future changes in accounting standards or our interpretation of current standards  particularly those affecting revenue recognition  could require us to change our accounting policies 
these changes could cause deferral of revenue recognized in current periods to subsequent periods or accelerate recognition of deferred revenue to current periods  each of which could impair our ability to meet securities analysts and investors expectations  which could cause a decline in our stock price 
changes in the accounting treatment of stock options will adversely affect our results of operations and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees 
changes in the accounting treatment for stock options required commencing february  will require us to account for employee stock options as compensation expense on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standard board issued a new statement  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as expense in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the new rules would be effective for us beginning february  we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions permitted by the fasb for purposes of implementing the change in accounting treatment 
this change will materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations and our timing to achieve profitability 
we have historically used stock options and other forms of equity compensation as key components of our employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
the changing regulatory landscape could make it more difficult and expensive for us to grant stock options to employees in the future 
in light of these changes  we may modify our equity compensation strategy to emphasize equity incentives other than stock options  including increased use of certain performance related features 
if employees believe that the incentives that they would receive under a modified strategy are less attractive  we may find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant 
table of contents equity instruments to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs  further change our equity compensation strategy or find it increasingly difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating results may suffer if we fail to achieve benefits from our strategic relationships 
we have formed in the past  and intend to continue to form in the future  strategic relationships with other technology companies in order to obtain a broader reach for our products and services 
we cannot guarantee that any new customer relationships or revenue will result from these strategic relationships 
in fact  we may not achieve any benefits from these relationships or similar relationships with other companies 
in addition  in the event that our strategic partners experience financial difficulties  we may not be able to realize any benefits from these relationships 
if we do not develop our distribution channels our ability to increase revenue and grow our business may be limited 
our ability to sell our products may be limited if we fail to develop our distribution channels 
in addition to our existing relationships  we intend to establish other indirect channels to increase the number of customers licensing our products 
moreover  our channel partners must market and sell our products effectively and be qualified to provide timely and  in some cases  cost effective customer support and service  which requires us to provide proper training and technical support 
if our channel partners do not effectively market and sell our products or choose to place greater emphasis on products of their own or those offered by our competitors  our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be negatively affected 
if we do not develop and maintain productive relationships with systems integrators  our ability to deploy our software  generate sales leads and increase our revenue sources may be limited 
we intend to develop and rely on additional relationships with a number of computing and systems integration firms to enhance our sales  support  service and marketing efforts  particularly with respect to the implementation and support of our products  as well as to help generate sales leads and assist in the sales process 
many such firms have similar  and often more established  relationships with our competitors 
these systems integrators may not be able to provide the level and quality of service required to meet the needs of our customers 
if we are unable to develop and maintain effective relationships with systems integrators  or if they fail to meet the needs of our customers  our business could be adversely affected 
because our success depends on our proprietary technology  if third parties infringe our intellectual property or if we are unable to rely upon the legal protections for our technology  we may be forced to expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we have a number of issued patents and pending patent applications  and we currently rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  trade secret and other laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
these legal protections afford only limited protection  and our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
our intellectual property may be subject to even greater risk in foreign jurisdictions  as the laws of many countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property  our competitive position may suffer 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and may lose our competitive position in the market before we are able to ascertain any such infringement 
in addition  competitors may design around our proprietary technology or develop competing technologies 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property 
table of contents rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
any such litigation could result in significant costs and diversion of resources  including the attention of senior management 
if our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  we could face costly litigation  which could cause us to pay substantial damages and limit our ability to use our technology or sell some or all of our products 
other companies  including our competitors  may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that could prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products 
as a result  we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
similarly  although we believe that we are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the open source licenses that we incorporate into our technology  we could be found to be non compliant or infringing upon the rights of others if these open source technologies prove to be proprietary 
intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following engage in costly litigation and pay substantial damages to customers or third parties  stop licensing technologies that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  terminate existing contracts with customers or with channel partners  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and redesign our technology and products  if feasible 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  our business and financial condition may be seriously harmed 
in addition  the occurrence of any of these conditions could have the effect of increasing our costs and reducing our revenue 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
our business will suffer if we do not enhance our products or introduce new products and upgrades to meet changing customer requirements 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands  evolving industry standards and increased complexity and interdependence of our applications 
any delays in responding to these changes and developing and releasing enhanced or new products and upgrades could hinder our ability to retain existing and obtain new customers 
in particular  our technology is designed to support a variety of hardware and software products that we believe to be proven and among the most widely used 
we cannot be certain  however  that present and future customers will continue to use these products 
even if they do  new versions of these products are likely to be released and we will need to adapt our technology to these new versions 
we must  therefore  constantly modify and enhance our technology to keep pace with changes made to our customers hardware and software configurations 
if we fail to promptly modify or enhance our technology in response to evolving customer needs and demands  fail to introduce new products and upgrades or fail to fully develop our new product offerings  our technology may not achieve widespread acceptance and could become obsolete  which would significantly harm our business 
as we introduce new products or technologies into existing customer environments  we may experience performance and functionality problems associated with incompatibility among different versions of hardware  software and networking products 
to the extent that such problems occur  we may face adverse publicity  loss of sales  loss of customer satisfaction  and delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 

table of contents we may require additional capital to fund our operations or may elect to raise additional capital if the market permits 
we believe that our current cash balances  including cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  if our licensing revenue does not meet our expectations  if we encounter unforeseen expenses or if our business plan changes  we may require additional equity or debt financing 
in addition  we may elect to raise additional capital if market conditions permit in order to increase our cash balance and expand our business 
if we elect to raise additional capital in the future  we cannot be sure that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we elect to raise additional capital through means of an equity financing  existing holders of our common stock will suffer dilution 
additionally  holders of any future debt instruments or preferred stock may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
any debt financing we raise could involve substantial restrictions on our ability to conduct our business and to take advantage of new opportunities 
we rely on third party software to develop and deliver our products to our customers  and the loss of access to this software could harm our business 
as part of our normal operations in connection with the development and delivery of our software  we license software from third party commercial vendors 
these products may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss of these products could result in delays in the sale of our software until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  procured and integrated  and these delays could result in lost revenue 
further  to the extent that we incorporate these products into our software and the vendors from whom we purchase these products increase their prices  our gross margins could be negatively impacted 
defects or security flaws in our products or claims asserted against us could result in the loss of customers  a decrease in revenue  unexpected expenses  loss of competitive market share and liability claims 
our products depend on complex software  both internally developed and licensed from third parties 
also  our customers may use our products with other companies products that also contain complex software 
if our software does not meet performance requirements  our customer relationships will suffer 
complex software often contains errors and is susceptible to computer viruses and may contain security vulnerabilities 
any failure or poor performance of our software or the third party software with which it is integrated could result in delayed or diminished market acceptance of our software products  delays in product shipments  unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to identify the source of errors or to correct errors  damage to our reputation  and liability claims and loss of future maintenance revenue 
although our agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims  these provisions may not be effective to the extent warranty exclusions or similar limitations of liability are unenforceable 
in addition  the extent of these limitations may require negotiation 
if any claim is made against us  we may be required to expend significant cash resources in defense and settlement of the claim 
if we are unable to retain our executive officers and key technical personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 
our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our key employees  all of whom are employed on an at will basis 
if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key technical employees  in particular  marc l 
andressen  our chairman  benjamin a 
horowitz  our president and 
table of contents chief executive officer  or timothy a 
howes  our chief technical officer  or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 
our business will suffer if we are unable to retain our highly qualified employees 
our future success depends on our ability to retain our highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
our failure to retain our qualified personnel could seriously disrupt our operations and increase our costs by forcing us to use more expensive outside consultants and by reducing the rate at which we can increase revenue 
as our customer base and revenue grows  we may need to hire additional qualified personnel 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense  and we may not be able to attract  train  integrate or retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel if we need to do so in the future 
in addition  we are dedicating significant resources in connection with ongoing management assessment of internal controls pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act and may be required to hire additional staff members to assist in these efforts 
important components of the compensation of our personnel are stock options and restricted stock  which typically vest over a four year period 
we may face significant challenges in retaining our employees if the value of our stock declines 
to retain our employees  we expect to continue to grant new options subject to vesting schedules  which will be dilutive to the investments of our existing stockholders 
some of our employees hold options with exercise prices that are higher than the price at which our common stock is currently trading 
if our stock price does not increase in the future  we may need to exchange options for new options or restricted stock  issue new options or grant additional shares of stock to motivate and retain our employees 
to the extent we issue additional options or shares of restricted stock  existing stockholders will experience dilution 
furthermore  potential changes in practices regarding accounting for stock options could result in significant accounting charges  which could raise our costs and impair our ability to use stock options for compensation purposes 
our stock price has been volatile and could decline 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  will likely continue to fluctuate in the future and may decline 
the market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile and frequently reaches levels that bear no relationship to the past or present operating performance of those companies 
delays in closing sales or completing installations could result in material variations in our quarterly results and quarter to quarter growth in the foreseeable future 
this could result in greater volatility in our stock price 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are variations in our quarter to quarter operating results  the loss of any of our significant customers or our failure to obtain new customers or renew existing contracts  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  new or enhanced products or services  acquisitions  distribution partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in our financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  changes in economic and capital market conditions for companies in our sector  changes in the enterprise software markets  changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors  changes in business or regulatory conditions  
table of contents interest rates and other factors affecting the capital markets  fluctuations in the trading volume of our common stock  and the occurrence of any of the adverse events discussed elsewhere in these risk factors 
insiders have substantial control over us and this could delay or prevent a change in control and could negatively affect your investment 
as of april   our officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us and could affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the interests of certain large stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders  and  accordingly  these stockholders could approve transactions or agreements that would not otherwise be approved by other stockholders generally 
substantial sales of our common stock or sales by insiders could depress our stock price 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or if any of our officers and directors were to sell shares of our commons stock held by them  the market price of our common stock could fall 
as of april   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
in connection with the completion of our acquisition of tangram in february  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock and registered those shares with the securities and exchange commission 
furthermore  in connection with the completion of our acquisition of rendition networks in february  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock to the stockholders of rendition networks 
sales of any of these shares could depress our stock price 
in addition  if certain venture capital firms that continue to hold our outstanding stock were to distribute their shares to their limited partners  the subsequent sale of shares by those limited partners could depress our stock price 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that could make it more difficult to acquire us 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include classifying our board of directors into three groups so that the directors in each group will serve staggered three year terms  which would make it difficult for a potential acquirer to gain immediate control of our board of directors  authorizing the issuance of shares of undesignated preferred stock without a vote of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and limitations on stockholders ability to call special stockholder meetings 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since we primarily invest in money market instruments 
however  due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates 
would result in less than a  decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
foreign currency risk 
as we expand into foreign markets  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets we plan to target 
to date  our exposure to foreign currency risk has not been material 
most of our sales are currently made in us dollars 
strengthening of the dollar could make our services less competitive in the foreign markets we may target in the future
