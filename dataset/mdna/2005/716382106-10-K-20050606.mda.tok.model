recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
this statement supersedes apb no 
 which is the basis for the company s current policy on accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r will require companies to recognize as an expense in the statement of income the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
sfas no 
r is effective for the company as of april   the beginning of the first quarter in fiscal under the methods of adoption allowed by the standard  awards that are granted  modified  or settled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r

except that compensation amounts must be recognized in the statement of income 
previously reported amounts may be restated either to the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented to reflect the sfas no 
r amounts in the statement of income 
pro forma disclosures about the fair value method and the impact on net income and net income per common share appear in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is evaluating the requirements of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  line of credit  and debt obligations 
the book values of cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
at march  we had no debt obligations 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and we do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our obligations under our line of credit 
as of june   there was no outstanding balance under the line of credit agreement 
a ten percent increase in short term interest rates on the variable rate debts outstanding as of june  would not have a material impact on our annual interest expense  assuming the amount of debt outstanding remains constant 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in revenue volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change are also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above
