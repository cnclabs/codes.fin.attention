overview the self storage industry is highly fragmented and is composed predominantly of numerous local and regional operators 
competition in the markets in which we operate is significant and has increased over the past several years due to additional development of self storage facilities 
we believe that the increase in competition has had a negative impact to our occupancy levels and rental rates in many markets 
however  we believe that we possess several distinguishing characteristics that enable us to compete effectively with other owners and operators 
we are the largest owner and operator of self storage facilities in the united states with direct and indirect ownership interests as of december  in  self storage facilities containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
all of our facilities are operated under the public storage brand name  which we believe is the most recognized and established name in the self storage industry 
located in the major metropolitan markets of states  our self storage facilities are geographically diverse  giving us national recognition and prominence 
this concentration establishes us as one of the dominant providers of self storage space in most markets in which we operate and enables us to use a variety of promotional activities  such as television advertising as well as targeted discounting and referrals  which are generally not economically viable to most of our competitors 
in addition  we believe that the geographic diversity of the portfolio reduces the impact from regional economic downturns and provides a greater degree of revenue stability 
we will continue to focus our growth strategies on i improving the operating performance of our existing self storage properties  ii acquiring properties operated and partially owned by the company  iii acquiring properties owned or operated by others  iv developing properties in selected markets  v expanding and repackaging existing real estate facilities  and vi participating in the growth of ps business parks  inc psb 
major elements of these strategies are as follows o we will focus on enhancing the operating performance of our self storage properties  primarily through increases in revenues achieved through the telephone reservation center and associated marketing efforts 
see self storage operations consistent group of facilities for further discussion 
we expect future increases in rental income to come primarily from increases in realized rent  although there can be no assurance 
o we will attempt to continue to acquire self storage facilities from affiliates or interests in affiliated entities that own self storage facilities which we manage  as they become available from time to time 
the pool of such available acquisitions has continued to decrease as we have acquired such remaining interests over the last several years 
such potential remaining acquisition opportunities include the remaining equity interests that we do not own in the entities described as other investments in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   as well as the other partnership interests and consolidated development joint venture in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  o we will acquire facilities from third parties 
prior to  this activity had not contributed significantly to our growth over the past three years 
however  during  we acquired interests in self storage facilities from third parties at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in addition  in january  we acquired six additional self storage facilities from third parties total net rentable square feet of  at an aggregate cost of approximately million in cash  and we currently have under contract to purchase six self storage facilities total net rentable square feet of  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
we believe that our national telephone reservation system and our marketing and promotional activities present an opportunity to increase revenues at these facilities through higher occupancies  as well as cost efficiencies through greater critical mass 
o we will continue to develop new self storage locations 
during the five years ending december   the company and the consolidated development joint venture developed and opened a total of storage facilities with total costs of approximately million 
in  we opened seven facilities with an aggregate cost of  at december   we have a development pipeline which includes self storage facilities that are expected to cost an aggregate of million  which we expect will open over the next months 
o we will look to expand and further invest into our existing self storage locations  either by improving their visual and structural appeal  expanding these facilities at a per square foot cost that is typically less than the cost incurred in developing a new location  or converting existing vacant space previously used by our containerized storage operations into traditional self storage space 
during   and  we have invested a total of million in such expansion  conversion  and repackaging activities 
at december   we have a pipeline of such projects to expand or repackage our existing facilities  and to convert substantially all of the vacant space previously used by our containerized storage operations  for an aggregate of million  which will add approximately  net rentable square feet 
completion of these projects is subject to contingencies  including obtaining governmental agency approvals 
we continue to evaluate our existing real estate portfolio to identify additional expansion and repackaging opportunities 
o through our investment in psb  we will continue to participate in the potential growth of this company s investment in approximately million net rentable square feet of commercial space at december  critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k summarizes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies whose application has a material impact on the company s financial presentation 
that is  they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
qualification as a reit income tax expense we believe that we have been organized and operated  and we intend to continue to operate  as a qualifying real estate investment trust reit under the internal revenue code and applicable state laws 
a qualifying reit generally does not pay corporate level income taxes on its taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders  and accordingly  we do not pay income tax on the share of our taxable income that is distributed to shareholders 
we therefore don t estimate or accrue any federal income tax expense 
this estimate could be incorrect  because due to the complex nature of the reit qualification requirements  the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances  we cannot be assured that we actually have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a reit for any particular taxable year 
for any taxable year that we fail or have failed to qualify as a reit and applicable relief provisions did not apply  we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income  whether or not we made or make any distributions to our shareholders 
any resulting requirement to pay corporate income tax  including any applicable penalties or interest  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
there can be no assurance that we would be entitled to any statutory relief 
impairment of long lived assets substantially all of our assets consist of long lived assets  including real estate  assets associated with the containerized storage business  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and on a quarterly basis evaluate other long lived assets for impairment 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the evaluation of goodwill for impairment entails valuation of the reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated  which involves significant judgment in the area of projecting earnings  determining appropriate price earnings multiples  and discount rates 
in addition  the evaluation of other long lived assets for impairment requires determining whether indicators of impairment exist  which is a subjective process 
when any indicators of impairment are found  the evaluation of such long lived assets then entails projections of future operating cash flows  which also involves significant judgment 
we identified impairment charges in the year ended december  related to our plan to close and consolidate certain containerized storage facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
future events  or facts and circumstances that currently exist  that we have not yet identified  could cause us to conclude in the future that other long lived assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
estimated useful lives of long lived assets substantially all of our assets consist of depreciable  long lived assets 
we record depreciation expense with respect to these assets based upon their estimated useful lives 
any change in the estimated useful lives of those assets  caused by functional or economic obsolescence or other factors  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimated level of retained risk and unpaid tenant claim liabilities as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we retain certain risks with respect to property perils  legal liability  and other such risks 
in addition  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company reinsures policies against claims for losses to goods stored by tenants in our self storage facilities 
in connection with these risks  we accrue losses based upon our estimated level of losses incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on recommendations from an independent actuary that is a member of the american academy of actuaries 
while we believe that the amounts of the accrued losses are adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts provided 
accruals for contingencies we are exposed to business and legal liability risks with respect to events that have occurred  but in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we have not accrued for such potential liabilities because the loss is either not probable or not estimable or because we are not aware of the event 
future events and the result of pending litigation could result in such potential losses becoming probable and estimable  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
some of these potential losses  of which we are aware  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accruals for operating expenses we accrue for property tax expense and other operating expenses based upon estimates and historical trends and current and anticipated local and state government rules and regulations 
if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect  our expenses could be misstated 
cost of operations  interest expense  general and administrative expense  as well as television  yellow page  and other advertising expenditures are expensed as incurred 
results of operations net income net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period in  representing an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily due to improved operations from our consistent group of self storage facilities  acquired and newly developed self storage facilities  combined with a decrease in income allocable to minority interests based upon ongoing distributions as a result of our restructuring of million of our series n preferred partnership units 
these factors are partially offset by an increase in the allocation of income to minority interest of  attributable to the restructuring of our preferred partnership interests  increased general and administrative expense attributable primarily to increased stock based compensation expense and reduced gains from the sale of discontinued real estate facilities 
net income for was  compared to  for  representing an increase of  or 
this increase in net income is primarily a result of an increase in the operations of our newly developed and expansion self storage facilities  improved contributions with respect to discontinued containerized storage operations  improved operations of our continuing containerized storage business  a net gain from the sale of real estate assets versus a net loss recorded in and lower interest expense resulting primarily from lower average debt balances 
the effect of these increases were partially offset by a reduction in our consistent group operating results as discussed below  increased depreciation expense resulting primarily from new property additions  and a decrease in equity in earnings of real estate entities 
the decrease in equity in earnings of real estate entities is primarily due to a reduction in our pro rata share of the earnings of psb caused by the impact of gains from the sale of real estate and asset impairment charges during and allocations of income among shareholders in computing the net income allocable to common shareholders for each period  we have deducted from net income i distributions paid to the holders of the equity stock  series a totaling  in each of   and  ii distributions paid to our preferred shareholders totaling  in   in  and  in  and iii amounts allocated to preferred shareholders in connection with preferred stock redemption activities as described below  totaling  in   in and  in the securities and exchange commission s clarification of emerging issues task force topic d eitf topic d in july requires that the original issuance costs of redeemed preferred stock be treated as an additional allocation of income to the holders of the preferred stock in determining the allocation of income to the common shareholders and earnings per share 
in the first quarter of  we expect to call for redemption our series f preferred stock  which will be redeemable in april accordingly  we expect an allocation of additional income to our preferred shareholders with respect to eitf topic d totaling  in future allocations of income pursuant to eitf topic d will depend upon how much preferred stock we redeem and the related original issuance costs 
net income per share net income was per common share  on a diluted basis  for compared to per common share for this increase was attributable to the factors denoted above with respect to net income offset partially by an increase in income allocated to preferred shareholders  as described above  and an increase in diluted shares outstanding from  in to  in the increase in shares outstanding was due primarily to the issuance of shares in connection with the exercise of employee stock options 
net income was per common share  on a diluted basis  for compared to per common share for this increase was attributable to the factors denoted above with respect to net income and a reduction in income allocated to preferred shareholders described above  partially offset by an increase in diluted shares outstanding from  in to  in the increase in shares outstanding was due to the issuance of shares in connection with the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of common shares in connection with the acquisition of partnership interests 
real estate operations self storage operations our self storage operations are by far the largest component of our operating activities  representing approximately of our revenues generated during rental income with respect to our self storage operations has grown from  in to  in  representing an increase of 
in  rental income grew to  representing an increase of over the year over year improvements in rental income are due to improvements in the performance of those facilities that we owned throughout each of the three years and the addition of new facilities to our portfolio  either through our acquisition or development activities 
at the end of  we had a total of  self storage facilities included in our consolidated financial statements 
since that time we have increased the net number of self storage facilities by facilities facilities  facilities and facilities 
we sold five facilities in  and their revenues  cost of operations  depreciation expense and the net gain on these sales for all periods presented are reported as discontinued operations on the consolidated income statement

self storage operations consistent group of facilities at december   we owned  self storage facilities that we have operated at a stabilized level of operations throughout the three year period 
the consistent group of facilities contains approximately million net rentable square feet  representing approximately of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our self storage portfolio

analysis of operating results in through during  the net operating income generated by our consistent group increased as compared to this increase was due to improved rental income combined with a reduction in depreciation expense  partially offset by increased cost of operations 
rental income  net of discounts  increased by in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in weighted average square foot occupancy in as compared to combined with a increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot 
cost of operations increased by in as compared to this increase was attributable primarily to an increase in direct property payroll due to higher incentives and other compensation to property operating and management personnel  as well as an increase in other cost of management due primarily to increased recruiting and training expenses and information technology costs 
depreciation expense declined  due primarily to a reduction in depreciation expense with respect to capital expenditures due to increases in capital expenditures becoming fully depreciated relative to new capital expenditures coming on line 
during  the net operating income of the consistent group of facilities declined from the same period in this decline was due to higher cost of operations offset partially by higher rental income 
cost of operations increased  primarily due to increases in payroll  advertising and promotion  property tax  repairs and maintenance costs  and property insurance 
direct property payroll increased due primarily to increased incentives paid to and hours worked by property operating personnel 
advertising and promotion increased due primarily to an increase in television advertising from  in to  in repairs and maintenance increased during as compared to due to costs to remedy mold issues in several facilities in southern states  increased snow removal expenses  as well as a general increase in costs to address deferred maintenance at our facilities 
property insurance increased due to an increase in our self insured portion of its risks 
rental income  net of discounts increased by in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in the weighted average occupancy  partially offset by a decrease in realized rent per occupied square foot of 
as previously reported  in  we changed our historical marketing strategy and began to aggressively increase rental rates and reduce the amount of promotional discounts offered to new tenants 
during the first nine months of  this strategy significantly enhanced the growth in our rental income from our historically experienced levels  and while our occupancy levels dropped during the first nine months of  it was at a level that we believed manageable 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a rapid decline in our occupancy levels 
this reduction coincided with a reduction in call volume into our national telephone reservation center that we believe was attributable to our pricing strategy as well as to general economic conditions 
we also experienced unusually high levels of move out activity 
beginning in early  we reversed our aggressive pricing strategy by reducing rates charged to incoming tenants and increasing move in discounts offered to these tenants and expanding our television advertising campaign 
however  there was a pause in these activities during the peak move in period in from may through july  due to an expectation that proved incorrect  that the demand during the peak season would be sufficient to stabilize our occupancy levels in the absence of significant promotional activities 
we reduced our rates  continued our television advertising campaign  and continued to offer move in promotional discounts throughout the remainder of and by the end of  we had largely attained our goal of reestablishing our occupancy levels to historical levels 
in addition  the improvement in occupancy levels enabled us to begin to increase rates that we charged to new tenants  which at the end of were higher than at the same time in throughout we continued our television advertising campaign in selected markets  and continued to offer various move in promotional discounts where warranted to sustain our occupancy levels and rental rates 
during the first half of  we were able to generate year over year rental income growth of approximately 
this growth was largely due to a improvement in occupancy levels combined with improved realized rental rates per occupied square foot 
during the second half of  year over year rental income grew approximately as compared to the same period in however  unlike the first half of where rental growth was primarily driven by occupancy gains  in the second half of the year rental growth was primarily driven by a increase in realized rents per occupied square foot 
we experience minor seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels of self storage facilities with occupancies generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months 
we believe that these fluctuations result in part from increased moving activity during the summer 
we also believe that our occupancy levels with respect to the consistent group of facilities have become more stabilized and therefore further year over year gains in occupancy levels will be difficult to generate 
we are currently working on new processes to improve our inventory management which may help us drive occupancy levels modestly higher  however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve our goal 
revenue outlook our goals are a sustainable occupancy level and moderate growth in rental income 
few expect that future growth in rental income will come principally from increases in rates  rather than increases in occupancy 
we are continuously evaluating our call volume  reservation activity  and move in move out ratios for each of our markets relative to our marketing activities and rental rates 
in addition  we are evaluating market supply and demand factors and based upon these analyses we are continuing to refine our marketing  promotional  and pricing activities to maximize rental income 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve our goals 
expense trends and outlook throughout and  we have increased regular and incentive compensation of our field operating and management personnel  as our field organization has focused upon improving customer service and productivity 
accordingly  direct property payroll increased in as compared to  and in as compared to in addition  during and  we increased the level of repairs and maintenance significantly  in order to improve the curb appeal and rent ready condition of our facilities 
repairs and maintenance increased in as compared to  and in as compared to the increase in also included increased snow removal expenses and costs to remedy mold issues at several facilities in southern states 
snow removal and mold related expenses declined in as compared to advertising and promotion expenses increased in as compared to  and in as compared to this was principally due to increases in television advertising expenditures  which increased from  in to  in to  in future television advertising expense will be dependent upon market conditions and the results of our pricing and promotional strategies 
for  we expect that operating expenses for our consistent group of facilities will continue to rise  probably matching the increase of to the following table summarizes selected financial data  with respect to the consistent group facilitates  for each of the quarters in  and for the quarter ended march june september december entire year amounts in thousands total rental income total cost of operations media advertising expense revpaf weighted average realized annual rent per occupied square foot weighted average occupancy levels for the period the following table sets forth regional trends in our consistent group of facilities with respect to rental income  cost of operations  net operating income  weighted average occupancy levels  and realized rent per net rentable square foot

     rental income and cost of operations for the acquired facilities have increased significantly in as compared to this increase  in part  is due to the acquisition of additional properties from third parties for an aggregate cost of million 
these acquisitions are described below o during july  we acquired two facilities from a third party for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
one of these facilities was located in salt lake city  and had been managed by us for many years 
o on october   we acquired facilities from a third party for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
this acquisition increased our presence in the minneapolis and milwaukee markets  and will allow us to cost effectively introduce media advertising in these markets  improve our yellow page ad placement  and drive operational efficiency 
in addition  the average rental rates and average occupancies of these properties are lower than comparable properties that we currently own in these markets 
o on october   we acquired six facilities in dallas from a third party for an aggregate of approximately million 
we believe that this acquisition improved our presence in submarkets of dallas where we were underrepresented 
o on november   we acquired facilities in the miami market for an aggregate of million 
we believe that these properties are well built and located in highly desirable submarkets in miami 
all of these facilities were built between and o on november   we acquired a facility in a submarket of san diego for approximately million 
operating results for the acquisitions  in the table above  represents the results of these acquisitions from the respective acquisition dates through december  on december   seven of these facilities the facility in salt lake city and the six facilities in dallas were sold to our acquisition joint venture 
this transaction  however  will be accounted for as a financing arrangement  accordingly  the operations of these properties will continue to be consolidated in our financial statements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in january  a significant interest in three of the facilities acquired in miami were sold to our acquisition joint venture 
similarly these transactions will be accounted for as a financing arrangement 
the acquisitions include properties acquired on january  from an affiliated development joint venture see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the acquisitions also included nine self storage facilities acquired from third parties for an aggregate of  in cash 
the acquisition includes one facility acquired from a third party for an aggregate cost of  operating results for the  and acquisitions collectively showed strong improvement in and these results were primarily driven by improved occupancy levels combined with improved realized rental rates per occupied square foot which combined improved rental income 
notwithstanding the damage to the facility discussed below  we believe these acquisitions will continue to provide growth to our earnings into due to improved year over year occupancy levels and rental rates 
during september  a facility located in florida  and included in our acquisitions  was significantly damaged by hurricanes 
as a result  occupancy levels and operating results for this facility were negatively affected during the fourth quarter of and are expected to continue to be negatively impacted into for  rental income and cost of operations for this facility were  and  respectively  as compared to  and  respectively  for occupancy for this facility was and at december  and  respectively 
we are in the process of repairing the damage and should bring the facility back on line fully during in january  we acquired additional self storage facilities from third parties total net rentable square feet of  at an aggregate cost of approximately million of cash 
as of march   we are under contract to purchase six self storage facilities total approximate net rentable square feet of  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
self storage operations expansion facilities as a result primarily of expansions to existing self storage facilities  the net rentable space at certain of our self storage facilities operations has changed 
accordingly  the operating results are not comparable in each of the three years ended december  the operating results for these facilities are presented in the self storage operations table above under the caption  expansion facilities 
these facilities contain approximately  net rentable square feet of self storage space at december   and  square feet of industrial space developed for containerized storage activities see containerized storage and discontinued operations 
the aggregate construction costs to complete these expansions totaled approximately million during the four years ended december  we have projects to repackage and expand our facilities  with an aggregate cost of million in our development pipeline at december   which will increase our traditional self storage space by an aggregate of  net rentable square feet  including the conversion of certain of the industrial space developed for containerized storage activities into traditional self storage space 
these activities will result in short term dilution to earnings from these activities 
however  we believe that expansion of our existing self storage facilities in markets that have unmet storage demand  and improving our existing facilities competitive position through enhancing their visual and structural appeal  provide an important means to improve the company s earnings 
there can be no assurance about the future level of such expansion and enhancement opportunities 
we expect that these facilities will continue to provide growth to our earnings into as we continue to fill the newly added vacant space 
at december   the weighted average occupancy level of these facilities was approximately as compared to one year earlier 
depreciation expense with respect to the expansion facilities was  in   in  and  in the increases in depreciation expense are due to the opening of the expanded portion of the facilities 
self storage operations developed facilities since january   we have opened newly developed self storage facilities and facilities that contain both self storage and containerized storage at the same location combination facilities 
these newly developed facilities have an aggregate of  net rentable square feet of which  net rentable square feet is industrial space developed for containerized storage activities see containerized storage and discontinued operations 
aggregate development cost for these facilities was approximately million

      self storage facilities opened in     self storage facilities opened in     a in the quarter ended september   we expanded an existing self storage facility that was originally developed in  adding  net rentable square feet at a cost of  unlike many other forms of real estate  we are unable to pre lease our newly developed facilities due to the nature of our tenants 
accordingly  at the time a newly developed facility first opens for operation the facility is entirely vacant generating no rental income 
historically  we estimated that on average it takes approximately months for a newly developed facility to fill up and reach a targeted occupancy level of approximately 
we believe that the newly developed self storage facilities have been affected by the operating trends in occupancy and realized rents noted above with respect to the consistent group of facilities 
in addition  move in discounts have a more pronounced effect upon realized rates for the newly developed facilities  because such facilities tend to have a higher ratio of newer tenants 
property operating expenses are substantially fixed  consisting primarily of payroll  property taxes  utilities  and marketing costs 
the rental revenue of a newly developed facility will generally not cover its property operating expenses excluding depreciation until the facility has reach an occupancy level of approximately to 
however  at that occupancy level  the rental revenues from the facility are still not sufficient to cover related depreciation expense and cost of capital with respect to the facility s development cost 
during construction of the self storage facility  we capitalize interest costs and include such cost as part of the overall development cost of the facility 
once the facility is opened for operations interest is no longer capitalized 
the yield on cost for these facilities for the year ended december   based on net operating income before depreciation  was approximately  which is lower than our ultimate yield expectations 
we expect these yields to increase as these facilities fill up 
properties that were developed before have contributed greatly to our earnings growth with net operating income before depreciation increasing by approximately million in as compared to this growth was primarily due to higher occupancy levels in as compared to we expect that these facilities will continue to provide growth  however  at a growth rate that is much lower than experienced in as occupancy levels become more stabilized 
with respect to our combination facilities  we have been steadily converting these facilities into entirely self storage facilities by converting the industrial space once used by our containerized storage operations into self storage space 
as of december   nine of the combination facilities have been converted into entirely self storage 
the remaining eight facilities are expected to be converted over the next two years 
weighted average occupancy levels for the combination facilities at december  was as compared to at december   the drop in occupancy due to the addition of more space during we continue to develop facilities  despite the short term earnings dilution experienced during the fill up period  because we believe that the ultimate returns on developed facilities are favorable 
in addition  we believe that it is advantageous for us to continue to expand our asset base and benefit from the resulting increased critical mass  with facilities that will improve our portfolio s overall average construction and location quality 
we expect that over at least the next months  the developed self storage facilities will continue to have a negative impact to our earnings 
furthermore  the expansion and newly developed facilities in our development pipeline described in liquidity and capital resources acquisition and development of facilities that will be opened for operation over the next months will also negatively impact our earnings until they reach a stabilized occupancy level 
commercial property operations commercial property operations included in our consolidated financial statements include commercial space owned by the company and entities consolidated by the company 
we have a much larger interest in commercial properties through our ownership interest in psb 
our investment in psb is accounted for on the equity method of accounting  and accordingly our share of psb s earnings is reflected as equity in earnings of real estate entities  see below 
our commercial operations are comprised of  net rentable commercial space operated at certain of the self storage facilities and four stand alone commercial facilities having a total of  net rentable square feet

we do not expect any significant growth in net operating income from this segment of our business for containerized storage operations during   and  we have significantly curtailed the scope and number of facilities of our containerized storage operations  and continue to evaluate additional facilities for closure 
at december   we operated containerized storage facilities located in major markets in which we have significant traditional self storage market presence 
the operations with respect to the facilities that were closed or consolidated in   and the closed facilities  including historical operating results for previous periods  are not included in the table below and instead are included in discontinued operations containerized storage on our income statement

rental and other income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the same period in  primarily as a result of the termination of our long distance moving service 
at december   there were approximately  occupied containers at the facilities 
direct operating costs principally includes payroll  equipment lease expense  utilities and vehicle expenses fuel and insurance 
the reduction in direct operating costs is due primarily to the aforementioned termination of our long distance moving service 
we expect that the net operating income of our containerized storage facilities in will be substantially equivalent to s results  with increases in net operating income prior to advertising substantially offset by increased yellow page and other media advertising 
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate level of the containerized storage business s expansion  level of gross rentals  level of occupancy or profitability 
we continue to evaluate the business operations  and additional facilities may be closed

tenant reinsurance operations on december   we acquired ps insurance company  ltd

the tenant reinsurance business earned   and  in revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively  and incurred   and  in operating expenses  for the same periods 
ps insurance generated net operating profits of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the future level of tenant reinsurance revenues is largely dependent upon our occupancy level and move in activity  as well as the level of such tenants that opt for such insurance

new insurance business comes from tenants who sign up for insurance as they move into our self storage facilities 
we have outside third party insurance coverage for losses from any individual event that exceeds a loss of  to a limit of  losses below these amounts are recorded as cost of operations for the tenant reinsurance operations 
the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is due primarily to  in estimated tenant claim payments resulting from a series of hurricanes in florida that occurred in the quarter ended september  equity in earnings of real estate entities in addition to our ownership of equity interests in psb  we had general and limited partnership interests in eight limited partnerships at december  psb and the limited partnerships are collectively referred to as the unconsolidated entities 
due to our limited ownership interest and limited control of these entities  we do not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes  and account for such investments using the equity method

in january  we entered into a joint venture partnership with an institutional investor for the purpose of acquiring up to million of existing self storage properties in the united states from third parties the acquisition joint venture 
the venture is funded entirely with equity consisting of from us and from the institutional investor 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   our pro rata share of earnings with respect to two of the facilities acquired directly by the acquisition joint venture are reflected in equity in earnings in the table above 
these two facilities were acquired by the acquisition joint venture directly from third parties at an aggregate cost of  our investment  with respect to these two facilities  was approximately  our future equity in earnings with respect to the acquisition joint venture will be dependent upon the level of earnings generated by these two properties owned by the acquisition joint venture 
the other investments includes our equity in earnings with respect to our pro rata share of earnings with respect to seven limited partnerships  for which we held an approximately consistent level of equity interest during the three years ended december  these limited partnerships were formed by the company during the s 
the company is the general partner in each limited partnership  and manages each of these facilities for a management fee that is included in interest and other income 
the limited partners consist of numerous individual investors  including the company  which throughout the s acquired units of limited partnership interests in these limited partnerships in various transactions 
our future earnings with respect to the other investments will be dependent upon the operating results of the self storage facilities that these entities own 
the operating characteristics of these facilities are similar to those of the company s self storage facilities  and are subject to the same operational issues as the consistent group of self storage facilities as discussed above with respect to self storage operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the operating results of these entities for the years ended december  and other income and expense items interest and other income interest in other income includes i the net operating results from our third party property management operations  ii the net operating results from our merchandise sales and consumer truck rentals and iii interest income 
interest and other income increased in as compared to  due primarily to higher interest income attributable to higher average cash balances and higher average interest rates on short term cash investments  offset partially by principal payments received on notes receivable 
interest and other income remained constant in as compared to reflecting the impact of improved operating results from our merchandise sales and consumer truck rentals  offset by lower interest income attributable to lower average interest rates on short term cash investments and principal payments received on notes receivable 
as discussed more fully in liquidity and capital resources below  at december   we had cash balances totaling approximately million 
in addition  during the first quarter  we issued approximately million of our series d cumulative preferred stock 
the net proceeds from this issuance and our december  cash balances will be used primarily to fund future development  acquisition  and preferred redemption activities see also management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
in the interim  the net proceeds from our cash balances is expected to earn nominal interest income relative to the corresponding divided requirement 
this difference will result in an estimated reduction to earnings per common share 
in addition  we may issue additional preferred stock during  raising the necessary funds to redeem additional high rate preferred stock during these issuances similarly will have a negative impact on earnings per share until the proceeds are utilized 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was  in   in  and  in included in depreciation expense with respect to our real estate facilities was  in   in  and  in the decrease in depreciation and amortization with respect to real estate facilities for as compared is due primarily to a reduction in depreciation with respect to maintenance capital expenditures  offset partially by an increase in depreciation with respect to newly developed and acquired facilities 
the increase from to is due to the acquisition and development of additional real estate facilities in through depreciation expense with respect to other assets  primarily depreciation of equipment and containers associated with the containerized storage operations  was  in   in  and  in amortization expense with respect to intangible assets totaled  for each of the three years ended december  depreciation and amortization during with respect to real estate facilities acquired or developed during amounted to  which was for a partial period for the time they were acquired until december   and we expect the annual depreciation expense with respect to these facilities for and forward will approximate  general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was  in   in  and  in general and administrative costs for each year principally consist of state income taxes  investor relation expenses  and corporate and executive salaries 
in addition  general and administrative expense includes expenses that vary depending upon the company s activity levels in certain areas  such as overhead associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities  employee severance  and product research and development expenditures 
the increase in general and administrative expense from to is primarily due to higher stock based compensation expense 
included in general and administrative expense for is  with respect to stock based compensation expense  including  in stock option expense   in restricted stock expense  and  in payroll taxes and other costs associated with employees exercise of  stock options in stock based compensation expense totaled  for  which is comprised of  in stock option expense   in restricted stock expense and  in payroll taxes and other costs associated with employees exercise of  stock options during total restricted stock and stock option expense  exclusive of payroll taxes on the exercise of options  should approximate million based upon options and restricted stock outstanding at december  future grants of restricted stock units and stock options could further increase our future stock based compensation expense 
the future level of payroll taxes and other costs associated with employees exercise of stock options will depend upon the timing of employees exercise of approximately  remaining stock options outstanding at december   the company s stock price at the time of exercise  and the level of future grants of stock options 
general and administrative expense increased in as compared to  is primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense from  in to  for interest expense interest expense was  in   in  and  in debt and related interest expense remain relatively low compared to our overall asset base 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to and is principally the result of lower average debt balances  offset partially by decreased capitalized interest due to lower average in process development balances 
capitalized interest expense totaled  in   in  and  in in connection with our development activities 
during  we assumed notes with an aggregate principal balance of million and an average interest rate of approximately in connection with property acquisitions  and incurred interest expense with respect to these notes of  for the partial period these notes were became our liabilities 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  on december   seven facilities were acquired by the acquisition joint venture from us for an aggregate of million in cash 
our joint venture partner s interest in these properties will be accounted from as a financing arrangement and their pro rata share of income with respect to their investment in these facilities will be included in interest expense 
in january  the acquisition joint venture acquired interests in three additional facilities from us for an aggregate of million in cash  and our joint venture partner s pro rata share of income will similarly be included in interest expense 
we do not expect any further facilities to be acquired by the acquisition joint venture  and future interest expense will be dependent upon the level of operations at the facilities acquired from us by the acquisition joint venture 
we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal as compared to  due to the assumption of additional notes combined with interest expense with respect to our acquisition joint venture  offset partially by the effect of scheduled principal payments of approximately  in interest paid  including capitalized interest  was  in   in  and  in minority interest in income minority interest in income represents the income allocable to equity interests in the consolidated entities  which are not owned by the company

on march   certain investors who held million of our series n cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units agreed  in exchange for a special distribution of  to a reduction in the distribution rate on their preferred units from per year to per year  and an extension of the call date for these securities to march  the investors also received their distribution that accrued from january  through the effective date of the exchange 
principally as a result of the rate reduction  ongoing distributions paid to the preferred partnership interests was reduced by  in as compared to this decrease was offset by an increase in income allocable to minority interests of approximately  due to i the  special distribution to the holders of the preferred units and ii the application of eitf topic d  the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock totaling  which represents the excess of the million stated amount of the preferred units over their carrying amount 
we have called for redemption our series n preferred units million and our series o preferred units million 
each of these securities will be redeemed for cash in march we expect additional allocations with respect to these units in accordance with eitf topic d will approximate  in the first quarter of  as a result of these redemptions 
we expect that our aggregate annual distributions for with respect to our cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units will approximate million after taking into consideration the march planned redemptions 
in november  we formed a development joint venture the consolidated development joint venture with a joint venture partner whose partners include an institutional investor and the company s chairman and former ceo  b 
wayne hughes mr

the consolidated development joint venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from the company and from the joint venture partner 
included in minority interest in income for the years ended december    and is   and  respectively  representing our joint venture partner s pro rata interest in the operations of the consolidated development joint venture 
the facilities in the entity are newly developed facilities that have been in the fill up phase 
the increase in minority interest in income in and as compared to the preceding years with respect to the consolidated development joint venture is due to the opening and fill up of the facilities owned by this entity 
we expect that such minority interest in income will continue to increase during as the facilities continue to fill up and increase the earnings of this entity 
the acquired minority interests reflect interests in the consolidated entities that we acquired as of december  and are therefore no longer outstanding 
there will be no further income allocated to these interests in and beyond 
other minority interests reflect income allocated to minority interests that have maintained a consistent level of interest throughout the three years ended december   comprised of investments in the consolidated entities and the operating partnership units described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the level of income allocated to these interests in the future is dependent upon the operating results of the storage facilities that these entities own  as well as any acquisitions of minority interests that we may acquire in the future 
discontinued operations as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  during  and  we implemented a business plan which included the closure of of containerized storage facilities that were open at december  the facilities are hereinafter referred to as the closed facilities 
during  we sold one of our commercial facilities located in west palm beach  florida 
the facility was sold to a third party on october  for an aggregate of million in cash 
in  we sold one of our commercial facilities to a third party for an aggregate million in cash 
these facilities are referred to as the sold commercial facilities during the first quarter of  we entered into a business plan to exit the knoxville  tennessee market  and listed our four self storage facilities in this market for sale 
in addition  in october  we sold a self storage facility located in perrysburg  ohio collectively  these five facilities are referred to as the sold self storage facilities 
these facilities were sold in for a gain of approximately  included in the table below 
during  in connection primarily with the closure or planned closure of of the closed facilities  we recorded asset impairment losses with respect to the containers and equipment utilized by these facilities totaling  in  we recorded impairment charges on assets for nine closed facilities of  and a  asset impairment charge on a real estate facility previously used by the containerized storage business  as well as an additional  loss upon sale of this real estate facility 
during  impairment charges of  were recorded with respect to the closed facilitates 
during  lease termination costs  representing the expected remaining lease liability following closure of the facilities  were accrued in the amount of  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities which we adopted on january   we no longer accrue for such lease termination or other liabilities and instead recognize such expenses as they are incurred 
the historical operations of the aforementioned facilities including the asset impairment losses and lease termination costs are classified as discontinued operations  with the rental income  cost of operations  and depreciation expense with respect to these facilities for current and prior periods included in the line item discontinued operations on the consolidated income statement

two of the closed facilities are in the process of closing which we expect will be completed in the first half of we expect that these facilities will continue to generate operating losses until final closure 
gain loss in disposition of real estate in the year ended december   we recorded a net gain on disposition of real estate assets of  as compared to a net gain of  in and a loss of  in the gain in is composed of a gain on sale of four vacant parcels of land and partial condemnation with respect to two existing self storage facilities totaling  as well as  casualty loss with respect to real estate assets damaged as a result of hurricanes in the state of florida 
the gain in is composed of a gain on sale of investments of  and a gain on sale of seven parcels of land and two self storage facilities aggregating  the net loss in is composed of a loss on disposition of land and a commercial facility totaling  as described in note  combined with a loss on disposition of partnership interests in the amount of  liquidity and capital resources we believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our operating expenses  capital improvements  debt service requirements and distributions to shareholders for the foreseeable future 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  we expect that these funds will be utilized to fund our acquisition and development activities  and fund the redemptions of preferred securities that become callable at our option during operating as a real estate investment trust reit  our ability to retain cash flow for reinvestment is restricted 
in order for us to maintain our reit status  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to make distributions to our shareholders see requirement to pay distributions below 
however  despite the significant distribution requirements  we have been able to retain a significant amount of our operating cash flow 
the following table summarizes our ability to fund distributions to the minority interest  capital improvements to maintain our facilities  and distributions to our shareholders through the use of cash provided by operating activities

our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt to total capitalization  increasing net income  increasing cash flow from operations  and a conservative dividend payout ratio with respect to the common stock 
we expect to fund our growth strategies with cash on hand at december   internally generated retained cash flows  and proceeds from issuing equity securities 
in general  our current strategy is to continue to finance our growth with permanent capital  either common or preferred equity 
we have in the past used our million line of credit as temporary bridge financing  and repaid those amounts with internally generated cash flows and proceeds from the placement of permanent capital 
in addition  we have assumed existing debt in connection with the acquisition of facilities 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our million bank line of credit 
our portfolio of real estate facilities remains substantially unencumbered 
at december   we had mortgage debt outstanding of million which encumbers facilities with a book value of million and unsecured debt in the amount of million 
we also have debt to joint venture partner amounting to million with respect to seven real estate facilities with an aggregate book value of million 
over the past three years we have funded substantially all of our growth with permanent capital both common and preferred securities 
we have elected to use preferred securities as a form of leverage despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred securities exceed the prevailing market interest rates on conventional debt 
we have chosen this method of financing for the following reasons i under the reit structure  a significant amount of operating cash flow needs to be distributed to our shareholders making it difficult to repay debt with operating cash flow alone  ii our perpetual preferred stock has no sinking fund requirement  or maturity date and does not require redemption  all of which eliminate any future refinancing risks  iii after the end of a non call period  we have the option to redeem the preferred stock at any time  which during through enabled us to effectively refinance higher coupon preferred stock with new preferred stock at lower rates  iv preferred stock does not contain onerous covenants  thus allowing us to maintain significant financial flexibility  and v dividends on the preferred stock can be applied to our reit distribution requirements 
our credit ratings on each of our series of cumulative preferred stock are baa by moody s and bbb by standard poor s 
we believe that our size and financial flexibility enables us to access capital when appropriate

the redemptions will take effect on their earliest redemption dates noted in the table above 
we expect that we will redeem each of these securities at each respective earliest redemption date 
cash on hand at december   will be utilized to redeem these securities 
requirement to pay distributions we have operated  and intend to continue to operate  in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify 
to the extent that the company continues to qualify as a reit  we will not be taxed  with certain limited exceptions  on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders  provided that at least of our taxable income is so distributed to our shareholders prior to filing of the company s tax return 
we have satisfied the reit distribution requirement since aggregate dividends paid during totaled million to the holders of our cumulative preferred stock  million to the holders of our common stock and million to the holders of our equity stock  series a 
although we have not finalized the calculation of our taxable income  we believe that the aggregate dividends paid in to our shareholders enabled us to continue to qualify as a reit 
we estimate that the distribution requirements for fiscal with respect to our cumulative preferred stock outstanding  and assuming the redemption of the preferred securities mentioned above  will be approximately million 
during  we paid distributions totaling million  including a special onetime distribution of million  with respect to our preferred partnership units 
we estimate the distribution requirements with respect to the preferred partnership units outstanding at december   assuming redemption of the series n and o preferred units at the dates indicated  to be approximately million 
for  distributions with respect to the common stock and equity stock  series a will be determined based upon our reit distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders
