item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report contain detailed information that you should refer to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis 
general we are a leading north american manufacturer of metal and plastic consumer goods packaging products 
we currently produce steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food  metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products  and custom designed plastic containers  tubes and closures for personal care  health care  pharmaceutical  household and industrial chemical  food  pet care  agricultural chemical  automotive and marine chemical products 
we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in north america  with a unit volume market share for the year ended december  of approximately half of the market in the united states  a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in north america for a variety of markets  including the personal care  health care  household and industrial chemical and pet care markets  and a leading manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures in north america for food and beverage products 
our objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business  reduce operating costs  build sustainable competitive positions  or franchises  and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns 
we have grown our net sales and income from operations at compounded annual rates of percent and percent  respectively  over the past ten years  largely through acquisitions but also through internal growth  and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market 
however  in the absence of such acquisition opportunities  we expect to use our cash flow to repay debt or for other permitted purposes 
sales growth we have increased net sales and market share in our metal food container and plastic container businesses through both acquisitions and internal growth 
as a result  we have expanded and diversified our customer base  geographic presence and product lines 
during the past seventeen years  the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self manufacture their metal food containers 
our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of nestle  dial  del monte  birds eye  campbell and most recently pacific coast reflect this trend 
we estimate that approximately percent of the market for metal food containers is still served by self manufacturers 
the metal food container market in north america was relatively flat during this period  despite losing market share as a result of more dining out  fresh produce and competing materials 
however  we increased our share of the market for metal food containers in the united states primarily through acquisitions  and we have enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high levels of quality and service and value added features such as our quick top tm easy open ends 
we anticipate that the market will decline slightly in the future  but will continue to increase in areas of consumer convenience products such as single serve sizes and easy open ends 
in  percent of our metal food containers sold had a quick top tm easy open end  representing an increase in unit sales of this value added feature of percent since we have improved the market position of our plastic container business since  with net sales increasing more than sixfold to million in we achieved this improved market position primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth 
the plastic container business of the consumer goods packaging industry is a highly fragmented business with growth rates in excess of population expansion due to substitution of plastic for other materials 
we have focused on the part of this market where custom design and decoration allows customers to differentiate their products such as in personal care 
we intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in markets where we believe that we can successfully apply our acquisition and value added operating expertise and strategy 
we extended our business into decorated plastic tubes primarily for personal care products to complement our plastic container business 
operating performance we operate in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure 
we have improved the operating performance of our plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
our acquisitions have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings and to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling 
for example  following our acquisition in march of silgan closures  we implemented rationalization and integration plans to consolidate certain administrative functions of this business with our metal food container business and to close a higher cost manufacturing facility 
we substantially completed these plans in and significantly improved the profitability of this business 
additionally  with our acquisition in april of the can manufacturing business of pacific coast  we were able to successfully rationalize and consolidate this business into our existing metal food container facilities and realize cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies as a result 
we have also invested substantial capital in the past few years for new market opportunities and value added products such as new quick top tm easy open ends for metal food containers 
over the past five years  we have invested million in capital to maintain our market position  improve our productivity  reduce our manufacturing costs and invest in new market opportunities 
we estimate that approximately percent of our projected metal food container sales in and a majority of our projected plastic container sales in will be under multi year arrangements 
many of these multi year supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of changes in raw material  labor and other manufacturing costs  thereby significantly reducing the exposure of our results of operations to the volatility of these costs 
historically  we have been successful in renewing our multi year supply arrangements with our customers 
for example  our metal food container business recently extended its supply agreements with our three largest customers  nestle through for approximately half of our sales under these agreements  del monte through and campbell through 
in the fourth quarter of  our metal food container business did not retain low margin business upon a contract renewal with a customer 
this loss of low margin business is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations in over the last couple of years  our plastic container business began to experience increased competitive pressures from new market entrants focused on larger customers in value added markets 
as a result  our plastic container business extended the term of several major supply agreements with various customers  but at lower prices  and elected not to meet competitive bids for some products 
our metal food container business sales and income from operations are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in those regions 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter 
use of capital historically  we have used leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns 
our stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of our long term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business  supports our financial strategy 
we intend to continue using reasonable leverage  supported by our stable cash flows  to make value enhancing acquisitions 
in determining reasonable leverage  we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions 
in the absence of such acquisition opportunities  we intend to use our cash flow to repay debt or for other permitted purposes 
in  we announced that in the absence of compelling acquisitions we intended to focus on reducing our debt and expected to repay million of debt over the period from through in  we paid down million of debt  making significant progress toward this debt reduction goal 
as a result  we believe that over the next two years we can meet our debt reduction goal and still complete some complementary acquisitions should they become available 
although no assurances can be given  we expect to pay down approximately million of debt during in the absence of acquisitions 
as a result of the debt reduction in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million to write off a portion of unamortized debt issuance costs 
to the extent we utilize debt for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods  our interest expense may increase 
further  since the revolving loan and term loan borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and  accordingly  our interest expense may vary from period to period 
after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at december  we had million of indebtedness which bore interest at floating rates 
in light of our strategy to use leverage to support our growth and optimize shareholder returns  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant interest expense 
for  our aggregate interest and other debt expense was percent of our income from operations  significantly lower than historic levels  primarily as a result of lower average borrowings due to our debt reduction program and a lower average cost of borrowings 
our aggregate interest and other debt expense was percent and percent of our income from operations for and  respectively 
in  we took advantage of favorable debt markets and refinanced all million principal amount of our outstanding senior subordinated debentures due  or the debentures  with lower cost notes  incremental term loans and revolving loans under the credit agreement and funds from operations 
due to this refinancing  in we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million for the premium paid in connection with the redemption of the debentures and for the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized premium related to the debentures 
acquisitions in january  we acquired substantially all of the assets of thatcher tubes  a privately held manufacturer and marketer of decorated plastic tubes serving primarily the personal care industry 
including additional production capacity installed shortly before the acquisition  the purchase price for the assets was approximately million in cash 
thatcher tubes operates as part of our plastic container business and extends our personal care business into decorated plastic tubes 
in march  we acquired the remaining percent equity interest in silgan closures that we did not already own for approximately million in cash 
additionally  we refinanced debt of silgan closures in the amount of approximately million and purchased equipment subject to a third party lease for approximately million 
the business is a leading manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures in north america for food and beverage products 
the business operates as part of our metal food container business 
in april  we acquired pcp can manufacturing  inc  or pacific coast can  a subsidiary of pacific coast  which self manufactured a majority of its metal food container requirements 
this acquisition continued the trend of food processors selling their metal food container manufacturing businesses 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash  including approximately million for inventory 
as part of the transaction  we entered into a ten year supply agreement with pacific coast under which pacific coast has agreed to purchase from us substantially all of its metal food container requirements

year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent increase as compared to primarily as a result of the full year inclusion of silgan closures which was acquired in march and the effect of higher average selling prices resulting from the pass through of higher raw material costs 
income from operations in increased by million as compared to and operating margin in increased by percentage points as compared to these increases resulted primarily from the post rationalization performance of silgan closures  the continued conversion to quick top tm easy open ends and the incurrence of rationalization charges of million in net income in of million increased by million as compared to primarily as a result of the above referenced improvements in income from operations  significantly reduced interest expense attributable to the debt refinancing in late and a lower average cost of borrowings  and a pre tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in we used strong cash flows from operations in to pay down million of debt during the year  making significant progress toward our debt reduction goal of to million for the years through net sales 
the million increase in consolidated net sales in as compared to was largely the result of higher net sales of the metal food container business due to the acquisition of silgan closures in march and the effect of higher average selling prices resulting from the pass through of higher raw material costs in both the metal food container and plastic container businesses 
net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the performance and full year inclusion of the silgan closures business  as well as higher average selling prices due to the pass through of increased metal costs and continued customer conversion to higher value added products 
net sales for the plastic container business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was primarily a result of higher average selling prices due to the pass through of increased resin costs  partially offset by the effect of prior year price concessions and a less favorable mix of products sold due primarily to weak demand from certain customers in the personal care market 
gross profit 
the increase in gross profit margin for as compared to was principally due to the strong post rationalization performance of the silgan closures business and increased sales of quick top tm easy open ends  partially offset by the impact of prior year price concessions in the plastic container business and higher depreciation and manufacturing expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased slightly as compared to as a percentage of consolidated net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were percent lower as compared to  primarily as a result of a benefit of million from a litigation settlement reached with an equipment supplier and the benefits of integrating the administrative functions of the silgan closures operations into our metal food container business 
income from operations 
income from operations for increased by million as compared to and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
we recorded rationalization charges totaling million in and million in income from operations of the metal food container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  while operating margin increased to percent from percent 
the increases in income from operations and operating margin were principally due to the strong post rationalization performance and full year inclusion of the results of the silgan closures business and increased sales of quick top tm easy open ends for which we had made significant capital investment over the past several years 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and increases in other manufacturing costs 
income from operations of the plastic container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent 
the increases in income from operations and operating margin were primarily a result of the rationalization charge of million incurred in and the benefit of million from a litigation settlement 
these benefits were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs  the effect of prior year price concessions and a less favorable mix of products sold 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense in decreased million to million as compared to this decrease resulted primarily from lower average borrowings resulting from debt reduction  a lower average cost of borrowings and the inclusion in of a million loss on early extinguishment of debt as a result of a late year refinancing 
these favorable comparisons were partially offset by a million charge in the fourth quarter of to write off a portion of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of our debt reduction program 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was percent as compared to percent in the increase in the effective tax rate was principally due to valuation allowances established for certain state net operating loss carryovers and credits 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent increase as compared to primarily as a result of the inclusion of three businesses acquired during early these acquisitions represent a continued strengthening of our franchise market positions  bringing our unit volume market share in the united states metal food can market to approximately half of the market  putting us in a leadership position in the metal  composite and plastic vacuum closure market for food and beverage products and further extending our product line to plastic tubes for the personal care market 
income from operations in also increased as compared to  despite the inclusion of million of rationalization charges in and million of rationalization credits in operating margin in declined by percentage points as compared to as a result of rationalization charges in as compared to rationalization credits in and the inclusion of the acquired silgan closures business 
in  silgan closures had lower operating margins than the rest of the metal food container business as it continued to execute a major restructuring program initiated prior to our acquisition of the business 
net income in of million declined by million as compared to as a result of pre tax rationalization charges of million and a pre tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
net sales 
the million increase in consolidated net sales in as compared to was largely the result of higher net sales of the metal food container business due to businesses acquired in net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of net sales of the silgan closures and pacific coast can businesses 
net sales for the plastic container business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was primarily a result of higher unit volume due largely to the acquisition of thatcher tubes and higher average selling prices due to the pass through of increased resin costs 
gross profit 
the increase in gross profit margin for as compared to was principally due to increased sales of value added products  largely offset by heightened competitive activities in the plastic container business  inflation in employee benefit costs and higher depreciation expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales for as compared to was largely due to higher levels of such expenses in the silgan closures and thatcher tubes businesses  inflation in employee benefits costs and the favorable impact in of net payments of million received in settlement for certain litigation 
income from operations 
income from operations for increased by million as compared to while operating margin decreased to percent from percent 
the increase in income from operations would have been million higher were it not for rationalization charges in as compared to rationalization credits in during  we recorded rationalization charges totaling million including the non cash write down in carrying value of assets of approximately million related to closing two plastic container manufacturing facilities and one metal closure manufacturing facility 
we recorded rationalization credits in totaling million 
income from operations of the metal food container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  while operating margin decreased to percent from percent 
the increase in income from operations was principally due to the inclusion of the results of the recently acquired businesses  increased sales of quick top tm easy open ends and improved operating efficiencies  partially offset by rationalization charges in as compared to rationalization credits in  higher depreciation expense and inflation in employee benefit costs 
the decrease in operating margin was due primarily to rationalization charges in as compared to rationalization credits in and the inclusion of the results of silgan closures 
income from operations of the plastic container business for decreased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin decreased to percent from percent 
the decreases in income from operations and operating margin were primarily a result of rationalization charges in as compared to a rationalization credit in  increased pricing pressures due to heightened competitive activities  higher depreciation expense and inflation in employee benefits costs  partially offset by higher unit volume and improved productivity 
operating margin was negatively impacted as higher sales associated with higher resin costs did not result in a corresponding increase in income from operations 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense in increased million to million as compared to this increase resulted primarily from a million loss on early extinguishment of debt as a result of refinancing all million of the debentures and higher average borrowings during the year due to three acquisitions completed in early  partially offset by a lower average interest rate in interest and other debt expense for included a million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to refinancing of our previous senior secured credit facility 
capital resources and liquidity our principal sources of liquidity have been net cash from operating activities and borrowings under the credit agreement 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from our obligations under the indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions and the refinancing of that indebtedness  capital investment in new and existing equipment and the funding of our seasonal working capital needs 
in the fourth quarter of  we utilized cash flow from operations to pay scheduled installments of million and voluntarily prepay an additional million of term loans under the credit agreement 
additionally  at december   there were no revolving loans outstanding under the credit agreement  as compared to million outstanding at december  the prepayment of our term loans generated a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million for the write off of a portion of our unamortized debt issuance costs 
in march  we completed a million incremental term loan borrowing under the credit agreement and used the proceeds largely to finance the acquisitions of silgan closures and thatcher tubes 
later in  we amended the credit agreement to increase the uncommitted incremental term loan facility under the credit agreement by million  and then we completed an additional million incremental term loan borrowing under the credit agreement and used the proceeds and other funds to redeem outstanding debentures 
in november  we issued million aggregate principal amount of notes 
the issue price for the notes was of their principal amount 
the notes are general unsecured obligations of the company  subordinate in right of payment to obligations under the credit agreement and effectively subordinate to all obligations of the subsidiaries of the company 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in cash on the th day of each may and november 
the net cash proceeds from this issuance and other funds were used to redeem our debentures 
during  we redeemed all million of our outstanding debentures 
the redemption price was of the principal amount  or million  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
we funded this redemption with the proceeds from the issuance of the notes  incremental term loans and revolving loans under the credit agreement and funds from operations 
we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in for the premium paid in connection with this redemption and for the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized premium related to the redeemed debentures 
in  we used cash from operations of million  proceeds from asset sales of million  proceeds from stock option exercises of million and increases in outstanding checks of million to fund capital expenditures of million  net repayments of long term debt and revolving loans of million  dividends paid on common stock of million and debt issuance costs of million and to increase cash balances by million 
in  trade accounts receivable  net decreased million due to the timing of cash collections from our customers 
trade accounts payable increased million due to the timing of payments and price increases of raw material purchases 
in  we used cash from incremental term loan borrowings of million  cash from operations of million  proceeds from the issuance of the notes of million  cash balances of million  net borrowings of revolving loans of million  increases in outstanding checks of million  proceeds from asset sales of million and proceeds from stock option exercises of million to redeem the debentures for million  purchase businesses for million  fund capital expenditures of million  repay term loans under the credit agreement of million and pay debt issuance costs of million 
in  trade accounts receivable  net  inventories and trade accounts payable increased primarily due to acquisitions completed in the increase in inventories was partially offset by a successful finished goods inventory reduction program in our metal food container business 
in  we used proceeds of million from an add on issuance of debentures  cash generated from operations of million  increases in outstanding checks of million  proceeds from stock option exercises of million and proceeds from asset sales of million to fund capital expenditures of million  net repayments of revolving loans and long term debt of million and debt issuance costs of million and to increase cash balances by million 
in  our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend on our common stock and in april  july and november of approved a per share quarterly cash dividend 
the cash payments for dividends in totaled million 
in february  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  payable on march  to the holders of record of our common stock on march  the cash payment for this dividend is expected to approximate million 
as of december   there were no revolving loans outstanding under the credit agreement  and  after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  the available portion of the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement was million 
revolving loans under the credit agreement may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed until their final maturity on june  the credit agreement also provided us with a term loans million outstanding at december  and b term loans million outstanding at december   which are required to be repaid in annual installments through june  and november   respectively 
at december   the uncommitted incremental term loan facility was million 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
under the credit agreement  the interest rate for all loans will be either the eurodollar rate plus a margin or the prime lending rate of deutsche bank trust company americas plus a margin 
the margins are subject to adjustment quarterly based upon financial ratios set forth in the credit agreement 
during  we completed an amendment to the credit agreement that lowered the margin on our b term loans by twenty five basis points  resulting in an interest rate on our b term loans of libor plus percent 
because we sell metal containers used in the fruit and vegetable packing process  we have seasonal sales 
as is common in the industry  we must utilize working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the end of the packing season 
due to our seasonal requirements  we incur short term indebtedness to finance our working capital requirements 
for  we estimate that we will utilize approximately million of revolving loans under our credit agreement for our peak seasonal working capital requirements 
we may use the available portion of our revolving loan facilities  after taking into account our seasonal needs and outstanding letters of credit  for acquisitions and other permitted purposes 
in addition to our operating cash needs  we believe our cash requirements over the next few years will consist primarily of o annual capital expenditures of to million  o annual principal amortization payments of bank term loans under the credit agreement of million  o quarterly common stock dividend payments of approximately million assuming our board of directors continues to approve dividends at the same level  o our interest requirements  including interest on revolving loans the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements and bank term loans under the credit agreement  which bear fluctuating rates of interest  and the notes  and o payments of approximately to million for federal  state and foreign tax liabilities in  which represents a significant increase from prior years as we fully utilize certain alternative minimum tax and other credit carryforwards and which may increase annually thereafter 
these amounts do not reflect the impact of any potential repatriation of earnings under the american jobs creation act of  or the ajca  which we are still evaluating or the impact of the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 
we believe that cash generated from operations and funds from borrowings available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service  tax obligations and common stock dividends for the foreseeable future 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and may incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under the credit agreement  to finance any such acquisition 
the credit agreement and the indenture with respect to the notes contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur debt  sell assets  pay dividends and engage in certain transactions 
we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on our business or our results of operations 
we are in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in our financing agreements and believe that we will continue to be in compliance during with all of these covenants 
contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations at december  are provided below payment due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in millions long term debt obligations interest on fixed rate debt interest on variable rate debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations other postretirement benefit obligations total  these amounts represent expected cash payments of our long term debt 
these amounts represent expected cash payments of our interest on fixed rate long term debt 
these amounts represent expected cash payments of our interest on variable rate long term debt  after taking into consideration our interest rate swap agreements  at prevailing interest rates at december  purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures 
obligations that are cancelable without penalty are excluded 
other postretirement benefit obligations have been actuarially determined through the year based on current tax law  there are no minimum required contributions to our pension plans in however  this is subject to change based on current tax proposals before congress  as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
during  we made pension contributions of approximately million  of which approximately million represented minimum funding requirements 
at december   we also had outstanding letters of credit of million that were issued under the credit agreement 
you should also read notes and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on us  other than to increase our cost of borrowing 
in general  we have been able to increase the sales prices of our products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials and to significantly reduce the exposure of our results of operations to increases in other costs  such as labor and other manufacturing costs 
because we have indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  our financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these agreements  floating rate interest based on the three month libor rate was exchanged for fixed rates of interest ranging from percent to percent 
at december   the aggregate notional principal amounts of these agreements was million  with million aggregate notional principal amount maturing in  million aggregate notional principal amount maturing in and million aggregate notional principal amount maturing in each of and depending upon market conditions  we may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in our judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge our exposure against interest rate volatility 
rationalization charges credits and acquisition reserves during  we approved and announced to employees a plan to exit our benton harbor  michigan metal food container manufacturing facility and another operation 
this decision resulted in a charge to earnings during of million  of which million was for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets 
through december   we made cash payments totaling million related to these plans 
all actions under these plans have been completed 
during  we established acquisition reserves in connection with our purchases of thatcher tubes  silgan closures and pacific coast can aggregating approximately million  recorded pursuant to plans that we began to assess and formulate at the date of the acquisitions 
during  we finalized these plans and reduced the related acquisition reserves by approximately million 
these plans included exiting the lodi  california metal food container manufacturing facility  the chicago  illinois and queretaro  mexico metal closures manufacturing facilities and the culiacan  mexico plastic container manufacturing facility  as well as the consolidation of certain administrative functions of the acquired businesses 
all of these facilities have ceased manufacturing operations 
through december   we made cash payments totaling million related to these plans 
at december   these reserves had an aggregate balance of million 
cash payments related to these plans are expected to continue through the second quarter of during  we approved and announced to employees plans to exit our norwalk  connecticut and anaheim  california plastic container manufacturing facilities and our queretaro  mexico metal closures manufacturing facility  as well as to consolidate certain administrative functions of the silgan closures business 
these plans included the termination of approximately plant employees and other related exit costs 
these decisions resulted in a charge to earnings of million million for the metal food container business and million for the plastic container business in  which consisted of million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets  million for employee severance and benefits costs and million for plant exit costs 
during  additional rationalization charges of million were recorded related to these plans million for the metal food container business and million for the plastic container business 
since inception  a total of million and million has been expended for employee severance and benefits and plant exit costs  respectively  and million has been recorded for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets 
at december   these reserves had an aggregate balance of million 
the timing of certain cash payments related to these reserves is dependent upon the expiration of a lease obligation 
accordingly  cash payments related to these reserves are expected through we recorded rationalization credits in totaling million 
these rationalization credits included million related primarily to the decision to support new business requirements by continuing to operate our kingsburg  california metal food container facility that was previously expected to be closed  million related primarily to certain previously written down assets of the metal food container business that were placed back in service to meet business requirements and million related to certain aspects of a rationalization plan to close a plastic container manufacturing facility that were completed at amounts less than originally estimated 
under our rationalization and acquisition plans  we made cash payments of million  million and million  respectively  in  and additional cash spending is expected in under our acquisition plans  rationalization plans and a prior rationalization plan 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
some of these estimates and assumptions require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe that our accounting policies for deferred income taxes  pension expense and obligations  rationalization charges credits and acquisition reserves and testing goodwill for impairment reflect the more significant judgments and estimates in our consolidated financial statements 
you should also read our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
at december   cs can had approximately million of deferred tax assets relating to million of federal net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  that expire between and  for which no valuation allowance has been established 
these nols are available to offset future taxable income of cs can 
we believe that it is more likely than not that these nols will be available to reduce future income tax liabilities based on estimated future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences in future periods 
current levels of cs can pre tax earnings are sufficient to generate the taxable income required to realize our deferred tax assets 
we would reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it became more likely than not that a portion of these nols would not be utilized 
if a valuation allowance were established  additional expense would be recorded within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which that determination was made 
silgan equipment company  or silgan equipment  had approximately million of deferred tax assets relating to million of federal nols that expire in  which have been fully reserved for through purchase accounting 
our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by approximately million 
for  we reduced our discount rate from percent to percent to reflect market interest rate conditions 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans  as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately million 
for  we assumed that the expected return on our pension plan assets was percent 
historically  we have maintained a strategy of acquiring businesses and enhancing profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
acquisitions require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plans for the acquired entities  which includes eliminating operating redundancies  facility closings and rationalizations and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of liabilities assumed 
we also continually evaluate the operating performance of our existing facilities and our business requirements and  when deemed appropriate  we exit or rationalize existing operating facilities 
establishing reserves for acquisition plans and facility rationalizations requires the use of estimates 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans  actual costs incurred may differ from these estimates 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment each year and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
our tests for impairment require us to make assumptions regarding the expected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units 
these assumptions are based on our internal forecasts 
developing these assumptions requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from these forecasts 
if an impairment were to be identified  it could result in additional expense recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges in all circumstances 
sfas no 
will be effective for us beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that public companies recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payment 
sfas no 
r is effective for us beginning with the third quarter of sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
we are still assessing which transition method to utilize 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation expense for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and diluted net income per share in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow activity  rather than as an operating cash flow activity as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on october   the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes a deduction of percent on certain foreign earnings that are repatriated during the calendar years of and we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriated in we have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision  however  we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after congress or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language 
the range of possible amounts that we are evaluating for repatriation under this provision is between zero and million 
the related potential range of income tax cannot be evaluated at this time 
forward looking statements the statements we have made in management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and elsewhere in this annual report which are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are made based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of uncertainties and risks 
therefore  the actual results of our operations or our financial condition could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause the actual results of our operations or our financial condition to differ from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements include  but are not necessarily limited to o our ability to effect cost reduction initiatives and realize benefits from capital investments  o our ability to locate or acquire suitable acquisition candidates on acceptable terms  o our ability to integrate the operations of our acquired businesses into our existing operations  o our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to invest in our business and service our indebtedness  o limitations and restrictions contained in our instruments and agreements governing our indebtedness  o our ability to retain sales with our major customers or to satisfy our obligations under our contracts  o the size and quality of the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and west regions of the united states or our ability to collect our seasonal receivables  o our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials or to maintain the ability to pass raw material price increases through to our customers  o compliance by our suppliers with the terms of our arrangements with them  o changes in consumer preferences for different packaging products  o competitive pressures  including new product developments or changes in competitors pricing for products  o changes in governmental regulations or enforcement practices  o changes in general economic conditions  such as fluctuations in interest rates and changes in energy costs such as natural gas and electricity  o changes in labor relations and costs  o the performance of the investments in our pension plans against the level expected  o changes in our evaluation of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets  o our ability to refinance the credit agreement prior to its maturity in  which will depend on  among other things  our financial condition at the time  the restrictions in the instruments governing our then outstanding indebtedness and other factors including market conditions  and o other factors described elsewhere in this annual report or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
in the normal course of business  we also have limited foreign currency risk associated primarily with our canadian operations and risk related to commodity price changes for items such as natural gas 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these risks 
interest rate  foreign currency and commodity pricing transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our net income and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing cost 
to achieve our objective  we regularly evaluate the amount of our variable rate debt as a percentage of our aggregate debt 
during and  our average outstanding variable rate debt  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements  was percent and percent of our total debt  respectively 
we manage a significant portion of our exposure to interest rate fluctuations in our variable rate debt through interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements effectively convert interest rate exposure from variable rates to fixed rates of interest 
we have entered into these agreements with banks under the credit agreement  and our obligations under these agreements are guaranteed and secured on a pari passu basis with our obligations under the credit agreement 
you should also read notes  and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report which outline the principal and notional amounts  interest rates  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows from these agreements 
based on the average outstanding amount of our variable rate indebtedness in  a one percentage point change in the interest rates for our variable rate indebtedness would have impacted interest expense by an aggregate of approximately million  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements during foreign currency exchange rate risk we do not conduct a significant portion of our manufacturing or sales activity in foreign markets 
presently  our foreign activities are conducted primarily in canada 
since we do not have significant foreign operations  we do not believe it is necessary to enter into any derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
commodity pricing risk we purchase commodities for our products such as metal and resins 
these commodities are generally purchased pursuant to contracts or at market prices established with the vendor 
in general  we do not engage in hedging activities for these commodities due to our ability to pass on price changes to our customers 
we also purchase other commodities  such as natural gas and electricity  and are subject to risks on the pricing of these commodities 
in general  we purchase these commodities pursuant to contracts or at market prices 
we manage a portion of our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations through natural gas swap agreements 
during and  we entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
at december   we had entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent of our expected exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
these agreements effectively convert pricing exposure for natural gas from market pricing to a fixed price 
you should also read notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report which outlines the terms necessary to evaluate these transactions 
based on our natural gas usage in  a ten percent change in natural gas costs would have impacted our cost of goods sold by approximately million  after taking into account our natural gas swap agreements
