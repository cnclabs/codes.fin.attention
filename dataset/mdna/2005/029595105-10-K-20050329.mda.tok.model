item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue recognition to be two areas that required the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the following are our critical accounting policies in which management s estimates  assumptions and judgments most directly and materially affect the financial statements revenue recognition the company has only one revenue generating activity  which is the operation of gamma knife units by gk financing  llc gkf  an owned subsidiary of the company 
revenue is recognized when services have been rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured  on either a fee per use or revenue sharing basis 
the company has fee per use hospitals and five retail hospitals 
under both of these types of agreements  the hospital is responsible for billing patients and collection of fees for services performed 
revenue associated with installation of the gamma knife units  if any  is a part of the negotiated lease amount and not a distinctly identifiable amount 
the costs  if any  associated with installation of the units are amortized over the period of the related lease to match revenue recognition of these costs 
for fee per use agreements  revenue is not estimated because these contracts provide for a fixed fee per procedure  and are typically for a ten year term 
revenue is recognized at the time the procedures are 
table of contents performed  based on each hospital s contracted rate 
there is no guaranteed minimum payment 
costs related to operating the units are charged to costs of operations as incurred  which approximates the recognition of the related revenue 
revenues under fee per use agreements are recorded on a gross basis 
gkf has five leases that are based on revenue sharing 
these can be further classified as either turn key arrangements or net revenue sharing arrangements 
for the three turn key sites  gkf is solely responsible for the costs to acquire and install the gamma knife 
in return  gkf receives payment from the hospital in the amount of its reimbursement from third party payors 
revenue is recognized by the company during the period in which the procedure is performed  and is estimated based on what can be reasonably expected to be paid by the third party payor to the hospital 
the estimate is primarily determined from historical experience and hospital contracts with third party payors 
these estimates are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted as necessary to more accurately reflect the expected payment amount 
the company also records an estimate of operating costs associated with each procedure during the period in which the procedure is performed 
costs are determined primarily based on historical treatment protocols and cost schedules with the hospital 
the company s estimated operating costs are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted as necessary to more accurately reflect the actual operating costs 
revenue for turn key sites is recorded on a gross basis  and the operating expenses the company reimburses to the hospital are recorded in other operating costs 
under net revenue sharing arrangements the hospital shares in the responsibility and risk with gkf for the capital investment to acquire and install the gamma knife 
unlike our turn key arrangement  gkf s lease payment under a net revenue sharing arrangement is a percentage of revenue less operating costs 
payments are made by the hospital  generally on a monthly basis  to gkf based on an agreed upon percentage allocation of income remaining after all operating expenses are deducted from cash collected 
revenue is recognized during the period in which the procedure is performed  and is determined based on the net reimbursement amount that gkf expects to receive from the hospital for each gamma knife procedure 
under the net revenue sharing arrangement  the percent of revenue received by gkf is recorded net of costs to provide a gamma knife treatment 
this estimate is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted as necessary to more accurately reflect the expected payment amount 
revenue from retail arrangements amounted to approximately  and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on possible losses relating to the company s revenue sharing customers 
the company receives reimbursement from the customer based on the customer s collections from individuals and third party payors such as insurance companies and medicare 
receivables are charged against the allowance in the period that they are deemed uncollectible 
if the company s net accounts receivable estimates for revenue sharing customers as of december  changed by as much as based on actual collection information  it would have the effect of increasing or decreasing revenue by approximately  general during the years ended december   and  of the company s revenue was derived from its gamma knife business

except for one unit that has been paid in full  all of the company s operating gamma knife units are financed by means of interest bearing debt 
twelve of the company s eighteen gamma knife units have been in operation for more than three years  and have lower interest expense than newer units because interest expense decreases with each principal payment

the company s trade accounts receivable increased to  at december  from  at december  this increase was primarily due to the addition of one new gamma knife contract during and an increase in the number of days revenue outstanding dso in accounts receivable for some of the gamma knife contracts 
the dso was and days as of december  and december   respectively 
we expect dso to fluctuate in the future depending on timing of customer payments received and the mix of fee per use vs 
retail customers 
other receivables decreased by  primarily due to application of credits due on certain under funded loans 
investing activities used  of cash in primarily due to an investment in short to mid term securities of  and for the purchase of site improvements at certain gamma knife locations

during the company s primary lender  dvi  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
the company made claims in dvi s bankruptcy case for certain unfunded amounts under credit agreements in place at the time of the bankruptcy filing 
the principal balance of notes that included the unfunded amounts were transferred by dvi to a third party lender  and the company has subsequently satisfactorily resolved any issues related to these unfunded amounts with that lender
