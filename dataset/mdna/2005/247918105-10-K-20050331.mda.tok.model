item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements set forth therein 
please also see part i item forward looking statements and risk factors 
general we are a specialty consumer finance company that originates  securitizes and sells and  prior to may  serviced non conforming mortgage loans 
our loans are primarily secured by first mortgages on one to four family residential properties 
throughout our year operating history  we have focused on lending to individuals who generally do not satisfy the credit  documentation or other underwriting standards set by more traditional sources of mortgage credit  including those entities that make loans in compliance with conventional mortgage lending guidelines established by fannie mae and freddie mac 
we make loans to these borrowers for purposes such as debt consolidation  refinancing  education and home improvements 
our mortgage business has two principal components 
first  we make mortgage loans to individual borrowers  which are a cash and expense outlay for us because our cost to originate a loan exceeds the fees we collect at the time we originate the loan 
at the time we originate a loan  and prior to the time we securitize or sell the loan  we either finance the loan by borrowing under a warehouse line of credit or self fund it 
second  we securitize loans and sell loans on a whole loan basis  and use the net proceeds from these transactions to repay our warehouse lines of credit and for working capital 
we traditionally have structured our securitizations as sales  which requires us to record cash and non cash revenues as gain on sale at the time the transactions are completed 
we began structuring our securitizations as financings in  which requires us to record revenues from these transactions over time 
when we sell whole loans  we record the premiums received upon sale as revenue 
securitizations since  we have used securitizations  whether structured as a sale or secured financing  effectively as a source of long term financing 
in a securitization  we pool together loans  typically each quarter  and sell these loans to a newly formed securitization trust 
for securitizations structured as a financing  the securitization trust is formed as a special purpose entity spe which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
for securitizations structured as a sale  the securitization trust is formed as a qualified special purpose entity qspe which is not consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
these trusts are established for the limited purpose of buying our mortgage loans and are bankruptcy remote meaning that purchasers of asset backed securities may rely on the cash flows generated from the assets held by the securitization trust for payment and not upon us for payment  likewise  the assets held by the securitization trust are not available to our general creditors 
we carry no contractual obligation related to these trusts or the loans sold to them  nor do we have any direct or contingent liability related to the trusts  except for the standard representations and warranties typically made as part of a sale of loans on a non recourse basis  despite carrying securitized loans and securitization financing on our financial statements 
furthermore  we provide no guarantees to investors with respect to the cash flow or performance of these trusts 
the securitization trust raises cash to purchase the mortgage loans from us by issuing securities to the public 
these securities  known as asset backed pass through securities  are secured  or backed  by the pool of mortgage loans purchased by the securitization trust from us 
these asset backed securities  or senior certificates  which are usually purchased by insurance companies  mutual funds and or other institutional investors  represent senior interests in the cash flows from the mortgage loans in the trust  which entitle their holders to receive the principal collected  including prepayments of principal  on the mortgage loans in the trust 
in addition  holders receive a portion of the interest paid on the loans in the trust equal to the pass through interest rate on the remaining principal balance of the pass through certificates 
depending upon the structure  the securitization trust may also issue interest only certificates  which entitle the holders to receive payments of interest at a predetermined rate over a fixed period of time 
the securitization trust also issues other certificates  namely excess cashflow certificates  comprised of a bio certificate  and a p certificate which entitles the holder to receive prepayment penalties received from borrowers who payoff their loans early 
for securitizations structured to be accounted for as secured financings  the mortgage loans that underlie the excess cashflow certificates are recorded on our balance sheet as mortgage loans held for investment  together with the related financing on the mortgage loans held for investment 
for securitizations structured as sales  we recorded an upfront gain at the time of securitization and generally capitalized excess cashflow certificates on our balance sheet 
during  we issued four securitizations totaling billion in collateral  of which we delivered into the securitization trusts a total of billion of mortgage loans during during  we issued four securitizations totaling billion in collateral  of which we delivered into the securitization trusts a total of billion of mortgage loans during we delivered million of mortgage loans in january using a pre funding feature relating to the fourth quarter securitization 
all of our and securitizations received ratings on various classes of securities ranging from aaa aaa to bbb baa rated by s p  moody s  and or fitch  respectively 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our and securitizations as of their issuance date by offering size which includes pre funded amounts  collateral  initial weighted average pass through rate and type of credit enhancement initial weighted offering average pass credit securitization issuance date size collateral through rate enhancement dollars in millions march  senior sub june  senior sub september  senior sub december  senior sub march  senior sub june  senior sub september  senior sub december  senior sub the securitization collateral amount includes million of mortgage loans we delivered during the first quarter of  through a pre funding feature in connection with our fourth quarter securitization 
each of our securitizations of mortgage loans during was structured to be accounted for as a secured financing 
under this securitization structure  the securitization trust holds mortgage loans as assets referred to as securitized loans and issues debt represented by securitization pass through certificates 
accordingly  the securitized loans are recorded as an asset on our balance sheet under mortgage loans held for investment  net and the corresponding debt is recorded as a liability under financing on mortgage loans held for investment 
this structure recognizes the related revenue as interest on mortgage loans held for investment and the related expense as interest expense on the bond financing 
in contrast  the structures we used prior to required us to record virtually all of the anticipated income as an upfront gain on sale of mortgage loans under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
we plan to continue to structure our securitizations to be accounted for as secured financings  which eliminates gain on sale accounting treatment 
consequently  income that would have otherwise been recognized upfront as net gain on sale of mortgage loans under our prior securitization structure has been recognized since the beginning of as net interest income interest income received on the mortgage loans less the interest expense on the corresponding securitization debt over the life of the loans 
we believe structuring  and therefore accounting for  securitizations as secured financings more closely matches the recognition of income with the receipt of cash payments on the individual loans 
each month the holder of an excess cashflow certificate will receive payment only after all required payments have been made on all the other securities issued by the securitization trust  because the excess cashflow certificates are subordinate in right of payment to all other securities issued by the securitization trust 
in addition  before the holder of the excess cashflow certificate receives payments  the excess cash flows are applied in a waterfall manner as follows first  to cover any losses on the mortgage loans in the related mortgage pool  second  to reimburse the bond insurer  if any  of the related series of pass through certificates for amounts paid by or otherwise owing to that insurer  third  to build or maintain the required level of the overcollateralization o c provision  as described below  for that securitization trust by applying the funds as an accelerated payment of principal to the holders of the pass through certificates of the related series  fourth  to reimburse holders of the subordinate certificates of the related series of pass through certificates for unpaid interest and for any losses previously allocated to those certificates  and fifth  to pay the net rate cap carryover  if any  which relates to the interest on the related pass through certificates that exceeded the maximum net interest amount available from the mortgage loans underlying the securitization trust 
each of our securitizations contains an o c provision  which is a credit enhancement that is designed to protect the securities sold to the securitization pass through investors from credit losses  which arise principally from defaults on the underlying mortgage loans 
in short  o c occurs when the amount of collateral ie  mortgage loans owned by a securitization trust exceeds the aggregate amount of senior pass through certificates 
the o c is created to absorb losses that the securitization trust may suffer  as loans are liquidated at a loss 
beginning with our securitizations  and in each of our subsequent securitizations  we created the o c by initially selling pass through securities totaling approximately to of the total amount of mortgage loans sold to the trust 
in doing so  we created the full amount of the o c required by the trust at the time we completed the securitization  instead of over time 
for example  if a securitization trust contains collateral of million principal amount of mortgage loans  and our o c requirement is  we issue approximately million in pass through certificates 
prior to  we generally built up the o c typically over the first to months of a securitization with the specific timing depending upon the structure  amount of excess spread  and performance of the securitization  by utilizing the cash flows from the excess cash flow to make additional payments of principal to the holders of the pass through certificates until the required o c level was reached 
we typically issued pass through certificates for a par purchase price  or at a slight discount to par with par representing the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans backing the asset backed securities 
for example  if a securitization trust contained collateral of million of mortgage loans  we typically received close to million in proceeds from the sales of those certificates  depending upon the structure we used for the securitization 
the o c is generally expressed as a percentage of the initial mortgage loan or collateral principal balance sold to the securitization trust 
the required o c is initially determined by either the rating agencies and or the bond insurer  if any  using various factors  including characteristics of the mortgage loans sold to the trust  such as credit scores of the borrowers and loan to value ratios  the amount of excess spread between the interest rate on the pool of mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust and the interest paid to the pass through certificate holders  less the servicing fee  and other related expenses such as trustee fees and bond insurer fees  if any  and the structure of the underlying securitization eg  issuing bbb certificates creates greater credit enhancement in the securitization transaction  which generally results in a lower o c 
during  our securitizations required an o c ranging from to of the initial mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust 
the required o c can increase or decrease throughout the life of the transaction depending upon subordination levels  delinquency and or loss tests and is subject to minimums and maximums  as defined by the rating agencies and or the bond insurer insuring the securitization 
in certain of our pre securitizations  after the o c requirement was reached  the excess cash flows are distributed to us if we are the holder of the excess cashflow certificates in accordance with the waterfall described above 
over time  if the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the required o c  all other required distributions have been made  and there is no shortfall in the related required o c  the excess is remitted to us as holder of the excess cashflow certificate 
each securitization trust also has the benefit of either a financial guaranty insurance policy from a monoline insurance company or a senior subordinated securitization structure  or a combination of the two referred to as a hybrid 
in a securitization trust with a financial guaranty insurance policy  all bonds are senior certificates 
the monoline insurance company guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest to the senior certificate holders in the event that the cash flows are not sufficient 
in senior subordinated securitization structures  the senior certificate holders are protected from losses and payment shortfalls first by the excess cash flows and the o c  then by subordinated certificates which absorb any losses prior to the senior certificate holders 
in a hybrid structure  the senior certificates generally have both the subordinated certificates to absorb losses and a monoline insurance company that guarantees timely principal and interest payments 
we began utilizing a new securitization structure in  in which we completed a concurrent nim transaction 
in a nim transaction  the excess cashflow certificate is sold without recourse to a nim trust  except for standard representations and warranties 
the nim trust issues nim note s that one or more third party investors will purchase 
we receive the net proceeds from the issuance of the nim note s 
the nim note s entitles the holder to be paid a specified interest rate  and further provides for all cash flows generated by the excess cashflow certificate to be used to pay all principal and interest on the nim note s until paid in full  which typically occurs approximately to months from the date the nim note s were issued 
the excess cashflow certificate entitles us to all cash flows generated by the excess cashflow certificate after the holder of the nim note s has been paid in full 
as part of a nim transaction  we typically fully fund the o c at closing as opposed to having it build up over time as we had in past securitizations which enables the nim investors to receive cash flows in the first month 
we use a portion of the net proceeds we receive from selling nim note s to make up for the difference between the principal amount of the mortgage loans sold  and the proceeds from selling the senior pass through certificates 
nim transactions generally have enabled us to generate upfront cash flow when the securitization and related nim transaction close  net of funding the upfront o c  securitization and nim costs  to offset a substantial portion of our cost to originate the loans included in the transaction 
in  the nim transactions have been structured to be accounted for as a secured financing in which the amount of nim notes are recorded as a component of the financing on mortgage loans held for investment  net a liability on our balance sheet 
conversely  in the securitizations and related nim transactions we completed prior to  the underlying securitization was structured as a sale under sfas no 
in these transactions  we recorded the net cash proceeds generated from the sale of the nim notes as a component of our net gain on sale of mortgage loans 
under this structure  we also retained  and recorded as a component of our net gain on sale of mortgage loans  a relatively small excess cashflow certificate 
we recorded the excess cashflow certificates at their estimated fair value  which normally ranged from to of the securitized collateral 
the change to portfolio accounting from gain on sale accounting has not changed the overall economics of the transaction  only the timing of income recognition and how the transaction is recorded on our financial statements 
the use of portfolio accounting structures will result in differences in our future expected results of operations as compared to historic results 
securitizations structured as a financing 
in  we completed four securitizations  which were structured to be accounted for as secured financings 
we intend to utilize this structure in the foreseeable future 
the securitizations were structured for accounting purposes as secured financings under sfas no 
the securitizations do not meet the qspe criteria under sfas no 
and related interpretations  because  after the loans are securitized  we have the unconditional right to repurchase from the trust up to one percent of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans at any time subsequent to the securitization closing date 
additionally  the securitizations do not meet the qspe criteria as we have the option to contribute a derivative instrument into the trust 
prior securitization transactions met the qspe criteria under sfas no 
and were accounted for  recognized and recorded as a sale 
in securitizations where we utilize a pre funding feature  which enables us to deliver loans after the closing date of the securitization  we will record an asset proceeds due from securitization trust during the pre funding period 
the proceeds due from securitization trust represents the balance of the cash proceeds remaining in the securitization trust that were received in connection with the trust issuing pass through certificates and a nim note in excess of the mortgage loans delivered to the securitization trust at closing 
upon delivering the subsequent eligible pool of mortgage loans  the trustee for the securitization trust will release the securitization trust proceeds  which will be used to repay any warehouse financing used to finance the subsequent pool of mortgage loans and to replenish our working capital 
as this structure is a financing  no gain on sale revenue is recorded at the time the securitization is closed 
rather  we record interest income from the securitized loans and interest expense from the pass through certificates issued in connection with the securitization over the life of the securitization 
deferred securitization debt issuance costs are amortized on a level yield basis over the estimated life of the bonds 
we also defer on our balance sheet  as a component of mortgage loans held for investment  net of the incremental direct fees and costs to originate the loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb statement no 
 which are amortized on a level yield basis over the estimated life of the related loans using the interest method calculation 
in addition  we allocate a portion of the accounting basis of the mortgage loans held for investment to the mortgage servicing rights  which results in a discount to the mortgage loans held for investment 
the cost basis fair value of the mortgage servicing rights msrs is determined based upon the price a third party servicer is willing to pay for the contract right to service that loan in the securitization 
the allocation of the cost basis between the loan and the msr  in accordance with sfas no 
 generally results in a discount being created on the loan retained in the securitization 
that discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield on the mortgage loans over the estimated life of the related loans using the interest method calculation 
since we began structuring our securitizations in as secured financings  and recording our income over time instead of upfront  there is a significant difference in our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to pre historical results 
as such  we do not expect historical results will provide a meaningful comparison to results 
we believe that portfolio accounting treatment  however  more closely matches the recognition of income with the receipt of cash payments on the individual loans 
securitizations structured as a sale off balance sheet arrangements 
in securitizations structured to be accounted for as sales  we recorded gain on sale revenue upon the closing of each such securitization 
for example  in each of the four securitizations that we issued in we derived  and recorded as gain on sale revenue  the following economic interests we received a cash purchase price from the sale of the nim note s issued by a nim trust to which we sold the excess cashflow certificates  we received a cash purchase price from the sale of interest only certificates  which entitles the holders to receive payments of interest at a pre determined rate over a fixed period of time  we received a cash purchase price from selling the right to service the loans that we securitized 
this right entitles the contractual servicer to service the loans on behalf of the securitization trust and earn a contractual servicing fee  and ancillary servicing fees  including prepayment penalties  in some cases  relating to the servicing rights we previously sold  and we retained an excess cashflow certificate  which entitles us to receive cash flow generated from the excess cashflow certificate issued in connection with the securitization after the holder of the nim note s has been paid in full 
although the cash flows generated by the excess cashflow certificates are received over time  under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we were required to report as income at the time of the securitization the present value of all projected cash flow we expected to receive in the future based upon an assumed discount rate 
our valuation of these excess cashflow certificates is primarily based on our estimate of the amount of expected losses or defaults that will take place on the underlying mortgage loans over the life of the mortgage loans  the expected amount of prepayments on the mortgage loans due to the underlying borrowers of the mortgage loans paying off their mortgage loans prior to their stated maturities  the libor forward curve  using current libor as the floor rate  and a rate of return discount rate 
at the time we completed the securitizations  we recognized as revenue each of the economic interests described above  which were recorded as net gain on sale of mortgage loans in our consolidated statement of operations 
our net investment in the pool of loans sold at the date of the securitization represented the amount originally paid to originate the loans  adjusted for the following any direct loan origination costs incurred an increase in the investment and loan origination fees received a decrease in the investment in connection with the loans  which are treated as a component of the initial investment in loans  the principal payments received  and the amortization of the net loan fees or costs  during the period we held the loans prior to their securitization  and any gains a decrease in the investment or losses an increase in the investment we incurred on any hedging instruments that we may have utilized to hedge against the effects of changes in interest rates during the period we hold the loans prior to their securitizations 
see summary of critical accounting policies accounting for hedging activities 
we allocated our basis in the mortgage loans and excess cashflow certificates between the portion of the mortgage loans and excess cashflow certificates sold through securitization and the portion retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of sale 
we may recognize gains or losses attributable to the changes in fair value of the excess cashflow certificates  which are recorded at estimated fair value and accounted for as trading securities 
we are not aware of any active market for the sale of our excess cashflow certificates 
although we believe that the assumptions we use to determine fair value are reasonable  there can be no assurance as to the accuracy of the assumptions or estimates 
the valuation of our excess cashflow certificates requires us to forecast interest rates  mortgage principal payments  prepayments and loan loss assumptions  each of which is highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment 
the rate used to discount the projected cash flows is also critical in the valuation of our excess cashflow certificates 
management uses internal  historical mortgage loan performance data and forward libor curves to value future expected excess cash flows 
we regularly analyze and review our assumptions to determine whether the expected return interest income on our excess cash flows certificates is within our expected range 
summary of critical accounting policies an appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results 
these policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties  and as a result  these estimates may significantly impact our financial results 
the precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a range of possible outcomes and a number of underlying variables 
excess cashflow certificates 
in securitization transactions structured to be accounted for as a sale prior to  the excess cash flow certificates represent one or all of the following assets bio certificate  which represents a subordinate right to receive excess cashflow  if any  generated by the related securitization pool 
as a holder of the bio certificate  we have the right to receive the difference  if any  between the interest payments due on the mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust and the interest payments due  at the pass through rates  to the holders of the pass through certificates of the same series  net of contractual servicing fees  trustee fees  insurer premiums  reimbursements and other costs and expenses of administering the securitization trust 
as a holder of the bio certificate  we will receive cash payments which  when we sell nim notes  is only received after the nim notes are paid in full only to the extent that the cash received by the securitization trust exceeds the amounts owed on all of the securities issued by that securitization trust  including amounts needed for the payment of any trust related expenses 
p certificate  which represents a right to receive prepayment penalties on the mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust 
generally  prepayment penalties are received from borrowers who pay off their loans within the first few years after obtaining their loans which  when we sell nim notes  is only received after the nim notes are paid in full 
cash flows from interest rate caps we receive payments on interest rate caps from third party interest rate cap providers through the securitization trusts 
the excess cash flows we receive are highly dependent upon the interest rate environment  because basis risk exists between the securitization trust s assets and liabilities 
for example  in each of the securitizations that we issued in and  the excess cashflow certificates are impacted by the securitization pass through rate sold to investors  which is indexed against the one month libor 
as a result  the interest rate received by the pass through certificate holders from the securitization trust each month may adjust upwards or downwards as the one month libor changes liability while the majority of the underlying mortgage loans assets in the securitization trust are fixed rate loans  or are at a fixed rate for at least two to three years before becoming adjustable rate loans 
as a result  as rates rise and fall  the amount of our excess cash flows will fall and rise  respectively 
this in turn will increase or decrease the fair value of our excess cashflow certificates 
the excess cashflow certificates held at december  are those we acquired before we began to structure our securitizations to be accounted for as secured financings in in each of our securitizations in which we sold nim note s  we purchased an interest rate cap  which helps mitigate the basis risk for the approximate time that the nim notes are anticipated to be outstanding 
the accounting estimates we use to value excess cashflow certificates are deemed to be critical accounting estimates because they can materially affect our income 
the valuation of our excess cashflow certificates requires us to forecast interest rates  mortgage principal payments  prepayments  index rates and loan loss assumptions  each of which is highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment 
the rate used to discount the projected cash flows is also critical in the valuation of our excess cashflow certificates 
management uses internal  historical mortgage loan performance data and forward libor curves to value future expected excess cash flows 
we believe that the value of our excess cashflow certificates at the date of a securitization reflected their fair value 
the amount recorded for the excess cashflow certificates is subsequently reduced for cash distributions we receive  increased for the expected return and adjusted for changes in fair value of these excess cashflow certificates 
at the closing date of each securitization transaction structured to be accounted for as a sale  we determined the present value of the excess cashflow certificates using the same assumptions we made regarding the underlying mortgage loans 
the excess cashflow certificate was then recorded on our consolidated financial statements at its estimated fair value 
the value of each excess cashflow certificate represents the cash flow we expect to receive in the future based upon our best estimates 
although we believe that the assumptions we use are reasonable  there can be no assurance as to the accuracy of the assumptions or estimates 
our estimates primarily include the following future rate of prepayment of the mortgage loans the expected amount of prepayments if the underlying borrowers pay off their mortgage loans prior to the expected maturity  credit losses default rates on the mortgage loans our estimated amount of losses or defaults that will take place on the underlying mortgage loans over their life because the excess cashflow certificates are subordinated to all other securities issued by the securitization trust 
consequently  any losses sustained on mortgage loans comprising a particular securitization trust are first absorbed by the excess cashflow certificates  the libor forward curve using current libor as the floor rate our estimate of future interest rates  which affects both the rate paid to the floating rate pass through security investors primarily the one month libor index and the rates earned from the adjustable rate mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust which typically provide for a fixed rate of interest for the first or months and a six month variable rate of interest thereafter using the six month libor index  and a discount rate used to calculate present value 
we monitor the performance of the loans underlying each excess cashflow certificate  and any changes in our estimates resulting in a change in fair value of the excess cashflow certificates is reflected as a change in fair value of excess cashflow certificates recorded in the statement of operations as a component of other income or other expense in the period in which we make the change in our estimate 
in determining the fair value of each of the excess cashflow certificates  we make the following underlying assumptions regarding mortgage loan prepayments  mortgage loan default rates  the libor forward curve and discount rates a 
prepayments 
we base our prepayment rate assumptions on our ongoing analysis of the performance of the mortgage pools we previously securitized  and the performance of similar pools of mortgage loans securitized by others in the industry 
we apply different prepayment speed assumptions to different loan product types based on our experience with different loan product types exhibiting different prepayment patterns 
generally  our loans can be grouped into two loan products fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans 
with fixed rate loans  an underlying borrower s interest rate remains fixed throughout the life of the loan 
our adjustable rate loans are a hybrid between fixed and adjustable rate loans  in that the interest rate generally remains fixed  typically for the first two or three years of the loan  and then adjusts  typically every six months thereafter 
within each product type  factors other than interest rates can affect our prepayment rate assumptions 
these factors include whether or not a loan contains a prepayment penalty  which is the amount a borrower must pay to a lender if the borrower prepays the loan within a certain time period after the loan was originated 
historically  loans containing a prepayment penalty typically are not repaid as quickly as those without a penalty  and as is customary in our industry with adjustable rate mortgage loans  the introductory interest rate we charge to the borrower is lower  between one and two full percentage points  than the rate for which the borrower would have otherwise qualified 
generally  once the interest rate begins to adjust  the interest rate payable on that loan generally increases  at times at a fairly substantial rate 
this interest rate increase can be exacerbated if there is an absolute increase in interest rates 
as a result of these increases  and the potential for future increases  adjustable rate mortgage loans typically are more susceptible to early prepayments 
there are several reasons why a loan may prepay prior to its maturity  including but not limited to a decrease in interest rates  improvement in the borrower s credit profile  which may allow the borrower to qualify for a loan with a lower interest rate  competition in the mortgage market  which may result in lower interest rates being offered to the borrower  the borrower s sale of the home securing the mortgage  the borrower s need for additional funds  and a default by the borrower  resulting in foreclosure by the lender 
it is unusual for a borrower to prepay a mortgage loan during the first few months because it typically takes at least several months after the mortgage loans are originated for any of the above events to occur  there are costs involved with refinancing a loan  and the borrower does not want to incur prepayment penalties 
we have found that the rate at which borrowers prepay their loans tends to fluctuate 
in general  prepayment speeds are lowest in the first month after origination  as described above 
thereafter  prepayment speeds generally increase until a peak speed is reached 
generally  loans will continue to prepay at the peak speed for some period of time  and then prepayment speeds typically begin to decline 
we use prepayment assumptions that reflect these tendencies 
the following table shows our current assumptions regarding the percentage of loans that will be prepaid during the first month following the closing of a loan  and the peak speed 
loan type month one peak speed fixed rate to adjustable rate if mortgage loans prepay faster than anticipated  we generally will earn less income in connection with the mortgage loans and receive less excess cash flow in the future because the mortgage loans have paid off 
conversely  if mortgage loans prepay at a slower rate than anticipated  we generally earn more income and more excess cash flow in the future  subject to other factors that can affect the cash flow from  and our valuation of  the excess cashflow certificates 
b 
default rate 
the default rate is the percentage of estimated total loss of principal  interest and related advances that will take place over the life of the mortgage loans within a loan pool to the total original principal balance of the mortgage loans in the pool 
a default rate is determined for each securitization reflecting the overall credit scores  average loan sizes and layered risks on the fixed and adjustable rate loans comprising each securitization trust 
we apply a default or loss rate to the excess cashflow certificate because it is the first loss piece and is subordinated in right of payment to all other securities issued by the securitization trust 
if defaults are higher than we anticipate  we will receive less income and less excess cash flow than expected in the future 
conversely  if defaults are lower than we expected  we will receive more income and more excess cash flow than expected in the future  subject to the other factors that can affect the cash flow from  and our valuation of  the excess cashflow certificates 
the current default rates applied on the excess cashflow certificates range from to  with the majority ranging from to 
c 
libor forward curve 
the libor forward curve is used to project future interest rates  which affects both the rate to the floating rate pass through security investors primarily one month libor and the adjustable rate mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust a fixed rate of interest for either the first or months and a variable rate of interest thereafter using six month libor 
most of our loans are fixed rate mortgages  and a significant amount of the securities sold by the securitization trust are floating rate securities the interest rate adjusts based upon an index  such as one month libor 
as such  our excess cashflow certificates are subject to significant basis risk and a change in libor will impact our excess spread 
if libor is lower than anticipated  we will receive more income and more excess cash flow than expected in the future  subject to the other factors that can affect the cash flow from  and our valuation of  the excess cashflow certificates 
conversely  if libor is higher than expected  we will receive less income and less excess cash flow than expected in the future 
in each of our securitizations in which we sold nim note s  we purchased an interest rate cap  which helps mitigate the basis risk for the approximate time that the nim notes are outstanding 
we have adjusted the valuation of each excess cashflow certificate to use a forward interest rate curve that represents both today s rates and the expectation for rates in the future 
we use a forward libor curve that we believe reflects the estimate of future libor rates 
d 
discount rate 
we use a discount rate that we believe reflects the risks associated with our excess cashflow certificates 
due to the unavailability of quoted market prices on comparable excess cashflow certificates  we compare our valuation assumptions and performance experience to our competitors in the non conforming mortgage industry 
our discount rate takes into account the asset quality and the performance of our securitized mortgage loans compared to that of the industry and other characteristics of our securitized loans 
we quantify the risks associated with our excess cashflow certificates by comparing the asset quality and payment and loss performance experience of the underlying securitized mortgage pools to comparable industry performance 
the discount rate we use to determine the present value of the cash flow from excess cashflow certificates reflects increased uncertainty surrounding current and future market conditions  including  without limitation  uncertainty concerning inflation  recession  home prices  interest rates and conditions in the equity markets 
we utilized a discount rate of at december  and on all excess cashflow certificates 
our valuation of retained excess cashflow certificates is highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictiveness of the relationships that drive the results of our valuation model 
the assumptions we utilize  described above  are complex  as we must make judgment calls about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increase  those judgments become even more complex 
in volatile markets  like those we have experienced over the past several years  there is increased risk that our actual results may vary significantly from our assumed results 
the longer the time period over which the uncertainties exist  the greater the potential for volatility in our valuation assumptions and thus impacting the fair value of our excess cashflow certificates 
for example  assumptions regarding prepayment speeds  defaults and libor rates are used in estimating the fair value of our excess cashflow certificates 
if loans prepay faster than estimated  or loan loss levels are higher than anticipated  or libor is higher than anticipated  a reduction in the fair value of these certificates will be recorded in earnings 
we believe that our assumptions are reasonable based upon the estimates using our historical loan performance and the performance of similar mortgage pools from other lenders in addition to accessing other public information about market factors such as interest rates  inflation  recession  unemployment and real estate market values  among other things 
however  these are just estimates and it is virtually impossible to predict the actual level of prepayments and losses  which are also driven by consumer behavior 
accounting for hedging activities 
we regularly issue securitization pass through certificates  backed by fixed and variable rate mortgage loans 
as a result of this activity  we are exposed to interest rate risk beginning when our mortgage loans close and are recorded as assets  until permanent financing is arranged  such as when the pass through certificates are issued 
our strategy is to use interest rate swap contracts in an effort to lock in a predetermined base interest rate on designated portions of our prospective future securitization financing 
at times  we also use corridors caps bought and caps sold that are designed to limit our financing costs within the securitization to maintain minimum margins  with the possibility of allowing us to increase margins in lower than anticipated interest rate environments 
both the interest rate swaps and corridors are derivative instruments that trade in liquid markets  and we do not use either of them for speculative purposes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we record all of our derivatives on our balance sheet at fair value 
for derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments  gains or losses resulting from a change in fair value are recognized in current period earnings 
when derivatives are used as hedges  however  hedge accounting is permitted only if we document the hedging relationship and its effectiveness at the time we designate the derivative as a hedge instrument 
if we meet certain requirements under sfas no 
 we may account for the hedge instrument as a cash flow hedge 
cash flow hedge accounting is appropriate for hedges of uncertain cash flows associated with future periods whether as a consequence of interest to be received or paid on existing variable rate assets or liabilities or in connection with intended purchases or sales 
under cash flow hedge accounting treatment  the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are divided into two portions  effective and ineffective 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss oci and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment hedges must be documented  with the objective and strategy stated  along with an explicit description of the methodology used to assess and measure hedge effectiveness  dates or periods for the expected forecasted events and the nature of the exposure involved including quantitative measures of the size of the exposure must be explicitly documented  hedges must be expected to be highly effective  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis 
effectiveness measures must relate the gains or losses of the derivative to changes in the cash flow associated with the hedged item  forecasted transactions must be probable  and forecasted transactions must be made with different counterparties other than the reporting entity 
if and when hedge accounting is discontinued  typically when it is determined that the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting  the derivative will continue to be recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value  with gains or losses being recorded in earnings 
any amounts previously recorded in oci related to the discontinued hedge are classified to earnings over the remaining duration of the debt 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax asset 
management needs to consider the relative impact of negative and positive evidence related to the ability to recognize a deferred tax asset 
this evaluation takes into consideration our recent earnings history  current tax position and estimates of taxable income in the near term 
if actual results differ from these estimates  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  which could negatively impact our consolidated financial position and results from operations 
we recognize all of our deferred tax assets if we believe  on a more likely than not basis  that all of the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
management believes that  based upon on the currently available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset 
therefore  at december  we did not maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
allowance for loan losses on mortgage loans held for investment 
in connection with our securitizations  which we structured to be accounted for as secured financings with the underlying mortgage loans held for investment  we established an allowance for loan losses based on an estimate of losses to be incurred in the foreseeable future 
we will charge off uncollectible loans at the time they are deemed not probable of collection 
in order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses on loans held for investment  we estimate losses using detailed analysis of historical loan performance data 
this data is analyzed for loss performance and prepayment performance by product type  origination year and securitization issuance 
the results of that analysis are then applied to the current long term mortgage portfolio held for investment and an estimate is created 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we believe that pooling of mortgages with similar characteristics is an appropriate methodology in which to evaluate the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
a provision for loan losses is charged to our consolidated statement of operations 
losses incurred  if any  will be written off against the allowance 
while we will continually evaluate the adequacy of this allowance  we recognize that there are qualitative factors that must be taken into consideration when evaluating and measuring potential expected losses on mortgage loans 
these items include  but are not limited to  current performance of the loans  economic indicators that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  changes in the market value of the collateral  political factors and the general economic environment 
as these estimates are influenced by factors outside of our control and as uncertainty is inherent in these estimates  it is reasonably possible that they could change 
in particular  if conditions were such that we were required to increase the provision for loan losses  any increase in the provision for loan losses may negatively impact our results of operations 
amortization of deferred loan origination costs interest income is recorded on our mortgage loans held for investment portfolio based upon a combination of interest accruals based on the outstanding balance and contractual terms of the mortgage loans  adjusted by the amortization of net deferred origination fees or costs accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb statement no 
our net deferred origination fees costs consist principally of origination fees  discount points  and payroll and commissions associated with originating our mortgage loans 
for our loans held for investment  these net deferred fees or costs are accreted or amortized as adjustments to interest income over the estimated lives of the loans using the interest method 
our portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment is comprised of a large number of homogeneous loans for which we believe prepayments are probable 
the periodic amortization of our deferred origination fees or costs is based on a model that considers actual prepayment experience to date as well as forecasted prepayments based on the contractual interest rate on the mortgage loans  loan age  loan type and prepayment fee coverage  among other factors 
mortgage prepayments are affected by the terms and credit grades of the loans  conditions in the housing and financial markets and general economic conditions 
prepayment assumptions are reviewed regularly to ensure that our actual experiences  as well as industry data  are supportive of the prepayment assumptions used in our model 
any changes to these estimates are applied as if the revised estimates had been in place since the origination of the loans  and current period amortization is adjusted to reflect the effect of the changes 
amortization of deferred debt issue discounts and transaction costs interest expense on our securitization financing is comprised of the accrual of interest based on the contractual terms  cash receipts and amortization related to our cash flow hedges swaps and corridors  the amortization of deferred issue discounts including msr related discounts and transaction costs 
the deferred issue discounts and transaction costs are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the estimated lives of the related debt using the interest method and take into account the effect of estimated prepayments 
any changes made to these estimates are applied as if the revised estimates had been in place since the issuance of the related debt  and result in adjustments to the period amortization recorded to interest expense 
federal  state and local taxation we report our income on a consolidated basis  using a calendar year and the accrual method of accounting 
the following discussion of federal  state and local tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us 
we face audits from various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve 
our united states federal income tax filings have been examined by the internal revenue service irs for calendar years ending prior to all differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled 
we are currently under examination by new york for the through calendar years 
although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain  in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters 
management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 
federal taxation corporate alternative minimum tax 
in addition to the regular income tax  the internal revenue code of  as amended the code imposes an alternative minimum tax amt in an amount equal to of alternative minimum taxable income amti to the extent the amt exceeds the taxpayers regular income tax 
amti is regular taxable income as modified by certain adjustments and tax preference items 
amti includes an amount equal to of the excess of adjusted current earnings over amti determined without regard to this adjustment and prior to reduction for net operating losses 
only of amti can be offset by net operating loss carry forwards 
the amt is available as a credit against future regular income tax 
the amt credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
for  we do not expect to be subject to the amt 
excess inclusion 
all or a portion of the income we receive from the residual interest excess cashflow certificates  which are created in a real estate mortgage investment conduit remic securitization  is referred to as excess inclusion 
with limited exceptions  excess inclusion is always subject to tax because it cannot be offset by other deductions or by net operating losses 
excess inclusion is primarily caused by the remic securitization trust utilizing cash  that otherwise would have been paid to the holder of the residual interest certificate  to make payments to other security holders thereby paying down the principal balance of the asset backed securities in order to create or maintain over collateralization 
in the future  we expect to continue to receive income from excess inclusion 
state and local taxation we are subject to tax in the various states in which we operate  with new york being the state which has the most signficiant tax impact on us 
new york state taxation 
we are subject to the new york state franchise tax in annual amount equal to the greater of a of entire net income allocable to new york state  or b the applicable alternative tax 
the alternative tax is generally the greater of a of our alternative entire net income  b 
of capital allocable to new york state  or c a fixed amount up to a maximum of  entire net income is similar to federal taxable income  subject to certain modifications  and alternative entire net income is equal to entire net income without certain adjustments 
we do business within the metropolitan transportation business tax district the district  which is comprised of the counties of new york  bronx  kings  richmond  dutchess  nassau  orange  putnam  rockland  suffolk and westchester 
a tax surcharge is imposed on business corporations doing business within the district and has been applied since the district tax rate is on the tax described above  subject to modification in certain circumstances  and is scheduled to expire for tax years ending on or after december  delaware taxation 
delta financial  as a delaware holding company not earning income in the state of delaware  is exempted from corporate income tax 
however  the holding company is required to file an annual report with  and pay an annual franchise tax to  the state of delaware 
results of operations our results of operations reflect our change from gain on sale accounting to portfolio accounting effective in the first quarter of accordingly  our financial statements from prior years may be of limited use in evaluating our operating results 
in addition  we have re organized the presentation of our financial statements to reflect our change from gain on sale to portfolio accounting 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  general our net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share basic and diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share basic and per share diluted  for the year ended december  the loss resulted primarily from our structuring our securitizations to be accounted for as secured financings  instead of sales 
consequently  we did not record any gain on sale revenue in connection with these securitizations and will instead record interest income from the securitized loans and interest expense from the pass through certificates issued in connection with the securitizations over the life of the securitizations 
conversely  we structured our securitizations to be accounted for as sales under sfas no 
 requiring us to record an upfront gain on sale equal to the present value of the estimated cash flows we expected to receive over the life of the securitizations 
additionally  the net income for the year ended december  was significantly impacted by a tax benefit of million recorded during the year 
we recorded net interest income after provision for loan losses of million during the year ended december   an increase of million  from the million recorded in the same period in the increase in interest income primarily reflects the net effect of recognizing interest income on billion of mortgage loans held for investment compared to no such loans held for investment in similarly  the increase in interest expense primarily reflects the net effect of recognizing interest expense on billion on financing on mortgage loans held for investment compared to no such financing on mortgage loans held for investment in we also recorded a provision for loan losses of million during the year ended december   compared to no such provision in during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  total non interest income decreased million and total non interest expense increased by million 
the increases in interest income  interest expense and provision for loan losses as well as the decrease in non interest income  primarily reflect the impact of our change from gain on sale accounting to portfolio accounting in  while the increase in non interest expense primarily reflects the increase in origination volume and increase in personnel for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in we originated billion of mortgage loans during the year ended december   an increase from billion of mortgage loans originated for the comparable period in we securitized and sold billion of loans during the year ended december   compared to billion of loans during the same period in net interest income we recorded net interest income before provision for loan losses of million during the year ended december   an increase of million  from the million recorded in the same period in the increase in net interest income primarily reflects the impact of our change from gain on sale accounting to portfolio accounting in net interest income is comprised of the following interest income 
interest income increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase is primarily due to the recording of million in interest income on our loans held for investment securitized  which totaled billion at december   an increase in the amount of mortgage loans we originated and held pending securitization or sale during the year ended december  compared to the same period in  and the increase in pass through certificate interest recognized at settlement due to the composition of fixed rate pass through certificates issued during the year ended december   compared to adjustable rate pass through certificates issued in the same period of the following table is a summary of interest income year ended december  dollars in thousands interest income on mortgage loans held for sale  net  interest income on mortgage loans held for investment pre securitization interest income on mortgage loans held for investment securitized interest income on excess cashflow certificates   pass through certificate interest income   miscellaneous interest income total interest income   the amount for the year ended december  includes million of prepayment penalty fees 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to the interest expense related to the financing of mortgage loans held for investment  nims and interest only notes and  to a lesser extent  the increase in loans originated and financed during the period on our warehouse facilities  compared to the same period in additionally  contributing to the increase in interest expense was the slightly higher warehouse financing costs due to a higher average one month libor rate  which is the benchmark index used to determine our cost of borrowed funds 
the rate increased on average to for the twelve months of  compared to an average of for the same period in partially offsetting these increases was the elimination of the interest expense paid on the senior notes which we redeemed during the fourth quarter of the following table presents the components of interest expense year ended december  dollars in thousands interest expense on warehouse financing   interest expense on mortgage loans held for investment financing interest expense on nim financing  interest expense on interest only financing interest expense on other borrowings interest expense on senior notes total interest expense   on october   we redeemed  at par  all of our outstanding senior notes due august provision for loan losses we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  related to mortgage loans held for investment 
the amount of the provision for loan losses is primarily driven by our securitization activities billion of mortgage loans held for investment at december  conducted during the year ended december  we did not have a provision for loan loss related to mortgage loans held for investment during the comparable period in  as we did not hold loans for investment at that time 
non interest income total non interest income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the decrease in non interest income was primarily due to the million decrease in net gain on sale of mortgage loans recorded in as compared to the decrease in net gain on sale of mortgage loans was the result of our changing the securitization structure we used in  and consequently  our accounting for securitizations of our mortgage loans to portfolio accounting  where interest income is recognized over the life of the loans  from gain on sale accounting  where revenue is recognized upfront at time of sale in accordance with sfas no 
non interest income is comprised of the following net gain on sale of mortgage loans 
net gain on sale of mortgage loans for the year ended december  is comprised of the difference between the selling price and the carrying value including deferred net origination fees of the related mortgage loans sold on a servicing released basis and gain on sale revenue recognized upon the first quarter of delivery of mortgage loans under a pre funding feature related to our fourth quarter securitization 
through the end of  our securitizations were structured to be accounted for as sales under sfas no 
accordingly  we recorded gain on sale revenue upon the closing of  and delivery of mortgage loans to  each such securitization during for the year ended december   net gain on sale of mortgage loans was comprised of the following the sum of a the cash purchase price we received in connection with selling one or more of the following securities in connection with our securitization s structured to be accounted for as sales for a particular period i a nim note  net of overcollateralization amount and interest rate cap and or ii an interest only certificate  b the fair value of the excess cashflow certificates we retained in a securitization structured as a sale for such period  c the premium received from selling mortgage servicing rights in connection with each securitization structured as a sale  and d the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related mortgage loans sold 
less the a costs associated with the securitization structured as a sale  b any hedge loss gain associated with such securitization accounted for as a sale  and c any loss associated with loans sold at a discount  together with any deferred origination costs or fees associated with mortgage loans sold

see securitizations 
net gain on sale of mortgage loans decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this decrease was directly related to our structuring the securitizations we issued in to be accounted for as secured financings 
this structure recognizes the related revenue as interest income over the life of the loans instead of recording virtually all of the income upfront as a gain on sale as our and prior structures required under sfas no 
during the year ended december   we delivered million of mortgage loans through a pre funding feature in connection with our fourth quarter securitization which was structured as a sale and sold million of mortgage loans on a servicing released basis  compared to billion of mortgage loans securitized all of which in securitizations structured to be accounted for as sales and million of mortgage loans sold on a servicing released basis during the same period in the weighted average net gain on sale ratio for the year ended december  representing the mortgage loans we delivered under the pre funding feature of our fourth quarter securitization and whole loans sales  and for the comparable period in  was and  respectively 
the weighted average net gain on sale ratio is calculated by dividing the net gain on sale by the total amount of loans securitized and sold 
other income 
other income increased  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in the net gains recorded on changes in the fair value of excess cashflow certificates during we recognized million of net gains due to changes in fair value of our excess cashflow certificates for the year ended december   as compared to  of such net gains in the same period in during the year ended december   we received  of income related to the llc 
we did not receive any income from the llc during the year ended december  we have a non voting membership interest in the llc which entitles us to receive to of the net cash flows from the llc 
we have not received our distributions since the second quarter of  due to a dispute with the llc s president  which has led us to commence a lawsuit to recover all of the amounts due to us and a counter suit by the llc 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
non interest expense total non interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase is primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs associated with a increase in our mortgage loan production  together with an increase in our personnel expenses and an increase in general and administrative expenses related primarily to other production related expenses 
payroll and related costs 
payroll and related costs increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of higher compensation and related payroll costs including medical and k expenses associated with an increase in our staff 
as of december   we employed  full and part time employees  an increase of over the full and part time employees as of december  additionally  payroll and related costs were higher due to higher loan commissions paid  resulting from higher loan production during compared to payroll and related costs include salaries  benefits and payroll taxes for all employees  but excludes the deferrable portion of those costs attributable to production related employees 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in non deferrable expenses associated with a year over year increase in loan production  the related increase in personnel and the ongoing expansion of our wholesale and retail divisions 
additionally contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses was a million increase in marketing  advertising and promotional expenses which totaled million for the year ended december   a million increase in professional fees and a  provision related to mortgage loans we are required to repurchase in accordance with our securitization agreements 
the increase in professional fees included  among other expenses   of accounting and other professional fees incurred related to sarbanes oxley documentation initiatives undertaken in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of office rent  insurance  telephone  depreciation  legal reserves and fees  license fees  accounting fees  travel and entertainment expenses  advertising and promotional expenses and the provision for recourse loans 
our increase in marketing  advertising and promotional expenses in was due to our increased marketing efforts made during the year  primarily in the form of direct mail and other marketing campaigns 
loss on derivative instruments 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net loss on derivative instruments of  the net loss was due to the recording of a million loss relating to the interest rate swaps used to hedge approximately million of securitization variable rate debt that were not accounted for as hedge instruments 
the loss was primarily offset by a million gain related to the fair value changes on our corridors that were not accounted for as hedging instruments prior to may and a  gain recorded on the ineffective portion of caps and interest rate swaps 
there were no gains or losses related to derivative instruments for the year ended december  income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  due to the pre tax loss recorded based on an effective tax rate of approximately  net of adjustments for permanent differences 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million 
this was comprised of a tax provision on current year s earnings of approximately million and a tax benefit of approximately million relating to the reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance based upon management s assessment of the positive trend in our profitability and cash flows during the year ended december  together with the retirement of all our long term unsecured debt 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  general we recorded net income for the year ended december  of million  or per share basic and per share diluted  compared to million  or per share basic and per share diluted  for the year ended december  net income for was favorably impacted by an income tax benefit of million 
net income for was also favorably impacted by an income tax benefit of million  or per basic share and per diluted share 
the primary drivers of the increase in net income were the increase in net gain on sale of mortgage loans and the impact of the tax benefits recorded year over year 
net gain on sale of mortgage loans increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase in net gain on sale of mortgage loans was a direct result of the increase in our loan origination volume year over year 
in and  our securitizations were structured to be accounted for as sales under sfas no 
 requiring us to record an upfront gain on sale equal to the present value of the estimated cash flows we expected to receive over the life of the securitizations 
net income for the year ended december  was also significantly impacted by the recording of a tax benefit of million 
net income for the year ended december  was impacted by an income tax benefit of million  or per share basic and per diluted share

the increases in non interest income and non interest expense primarily reflect the increase in origination volume and increase in personnel for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in we originated billion of mortgage loans during the year ended december   from million of mortgage loans originated for the comparable period in we securitized and sold billion of loans during the year ended december   compared to million of loans during the same period in whole loan sales decreased for the year ended december  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  net interest income we recorded net interest income of million during the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the million recorded in the same period in the increase in net interest income primarily reflects the impact of the increases in the average balance in of loans held for sale and warehouse borrowings as compared to net interest income is comprised of the following interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase is primarily due to a higher average loan balance on the loans we originated and held for sale during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase was partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our loans held for sale to for the year ended december   as compared for  and by a decrease in securitization bond interest

the rate decreased on average to for the twelve months of  compared to an average of for the same period in additionally offsetting the increase was the impact of the fourth quarter of senior note redemption  which eliminated the interest expense paid on the senior notes during the fourth quarter of  and lower other borrowing expenses  primarily due to lower financing rates on our capital leases

non interest income total non interest income increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase in non interest income primarily resulted from the increase in the gain on sale of mortgage loans due to the increase in the amount of loans securitized or sold during as compared to we recorded a net gain on the sale of mortgage loans of million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the same period in the increase was slightly offset by a million decrease in other income primarily reflecting the reduction in prepayment penalty fees received in as compared to net gain on sale of mortgage loans 
net gain on sale of mortgage loans is comprised of the premium received from loan securitizations structured as sales and from selling whole loans on a servicing released basis  together with any deferred origination costs or fees associated with mortgage loans

we recorded the gain on sale revenue related to the pre funded loans during the first quarter of during the third and fourth quarter of securitization transactions  the fair values of the related excess cashflow certificates were deemed to be zero 
at december   the fair value of the excess cashflow certificates related to the third and fourth quarter securitizations continued to be zero 
net gain on sale of mortgage loans increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase was directly related to the million  or  increase in loans sold  which was driven by higher loan production in compared to during the year ended december   we securitized structured as a sale billion of mortgage loans and sold million of mortgage loans on a servicing released basis  compared to million of mortgage loans securitized and million of mortgage loans sold on a servicing released basis during the same period in partially offsetting the increase due to volume was a decrease in our weighted average net gain on sale margin for the year ended december  to from in impacting the composition of the gain on sale of mortgages for the year ended december  was the valuing of the third and fourth quarter excess cashflow certificates in while we retained excess cashflow certificates on our third and fourth quarter securitizations  we did not record them as an asset due to the issuance of a limited amount of bbb certificates 
the issuance of the bbb certificates reduced the amount of overcollateralization required  compared to a structure without a bbb certificate 
the bbb certificates replaced the credit enhancements that would have otherwise been achieved solely through overcollateralization and the corresponding excess cashflow certificate 
the bbb certificates lowered the upfront overcollateralization and resulted in our receiving higher cash proceeds from the securitization effectively increasing the gain realized from the sale of the nim notes and the interest only certificates  as the senior certificates represent a larger percentage of the aggregate value of the mortgage loans sold 
additionally  during the year ended december   we sold interest only certificates which increased the cash proceeds from the securitization 
the interest only certificates entitle the holders to receive payments of interest at a pre determined rate  over a pre determined period of time 
the creation of the interest only certificate reduced the excess cash flow available to the excess cashflow certificate holders  reducing the value of the excess cashflow certificates 
we did not sell any interest only certificates in other income 
other income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in the amount of prepayment penalties received year over year coupled with us not receiving any income from the llc after the second quarter of during the year ended december   we received  of prepayment penalty fee income as compared to million for the year ended december  the prepayment penalty fee income decrease relates to the timing of our receipt of prepayment penalty fees
