item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction cimarex energy co 
is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company 
our operations are presently focused in oklahoma  texas  kansas and louisiana 
our primary focus is to explore for and discover new reserves 
to supplement our growth  we also consider acquisitions and mergers  such as the proposed acquisition of magnum hunter resources  inc on january   cimarex announced that its board of directors had unanimously approved an agreement and plan of merger that provides for the acquisition by cimarex of irving  texas based magnum hunter resources  inc terms of the merger agreement provide that magnum hunter stockholders will receive shares of cimarex common stock for each share of magnum hunter common stock that they own 
as a result of the merger transaction and based on the million magnum hunter common shares currently outstanding  cimarex expects to issue approximately million common shares to magnum hunter s common stockholders excluding thousand shares issued to a subsidiary of magnum hunter 
after closing  the combined company will have approximately million shares outstanding  and cimarex stockholders will own percent and magnum hunter stockholders percent 
the merger will be accounted for as a purchase of magnum hunter by cimarex 
the merger remains subject to approval by both companies stockholders as well as regulatory approvals 
industry and economic factors in managing our business  we must deal with many factors inherent in our industry 
first and foremost is wide fluctuation of oil and gas prices 
historically  oil and gas markets have been cyclical and volatile  with future price movements difficult to predict 
while our revenues are a function of both production and prices  it is wide swings in prices that have most often had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
our operations entail significant complexities 
advanced technologies requiring highly trained personnel are utilized in both exploration and production 
even when the technology is properly used  the interpreter still may not know conclusively if hydrocarbons will be present or the rate at which they will be produced 
exploration is a high risk activity  often times resulting in no commercially productive reservoirs being discovered 
moreover  costs associated with operating within the industry are substantial 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we compete with major and diversified energy companies  independent oil and gas businesses  and individual operators 
in addition  the industry as a whole competes with other businesses that supply energy to industrial and commercial end users 
extensive federal  state and local regulation of the industry significantly affects our operations 
in particular  our activities are subject to stringent environmental regulations 
these regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating  and abandoning oil and gas wells and related facilities 
these regulations may become more demanding in the future 
approach to the business profitable growth of our assets will largely depend upon our ability to successfully find and develop new proved reserves 
to accommodate an overall acceptable rate of growth  we maintain a blended portfolio of low  moderate and higher risk exploration and development projects 
we believe that this approach allows for consistent increases in our oil and gas reserves  while minimizing the chance of failure 
to further mitigate risk  we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins 
we may consider the use of transaction specific hedging of oil and gas prices  if warranted  to reduce price risk 
however  to date the use of hedging has not been implemented 
implementation of our business approach relies on our ability to fund ongoing exploration and development projects with cash flow provided by operating activities and external sources of capital 
we project that exploration and development expenditures will approximate million  up from million in we are expanding our program as a result of successful exploration wells drilled in  growth in our western oklahoma development projects and entry into new basins 
similar to  a large portion of our expenditures will be directed to our projects in oklahoma  texas and louisiana 
a total of million is anticipated to be invested in the mid continent area of oklahoma and north texas 
we plan to invest million in the upper gulf coast regions of texas and louisiana during the remainder of our projected expenditures will be focused in the permian basin  california and other western states 
based on expected cash provided by operating activities and stockholders equity of million  a cash balance of million  no debt  and proved reserves of bcfe  we believe we are well positioned to fund the projects identified for and beyond 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  reserves and properties  as well as goodwill and contingencies  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from oil and gas sales are recognized based on the sales method  with revenue recognized on actual volumes sold to purchasers 
there is a ready market for oil and gas  with sales occurring soon after production 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
for revisions of reserve estimates resulted in an increase of mmbbls of oil and an increase of bcf of gas  representing eight percent and five percent of proved oil and gas reserves  respectively  as of the end of the year 
revisions of oil and gas reserve estimates for resulted in an increase of percent and percent  respectively 
see note  supplemental oil and gas disclosures for reserve data 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties 
changes in reserve quantities will cause corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to the quantity revision or  in some cases  a full cost ceiling limitation charge in the period of the revision 
to date  changes in expense resulting from changes in previous estimates of reserves have not been material 
full cost accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of properties  as well as other internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities  are also capitalized 
under full cost accounting rules  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value discounted at percent of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
cash flows used in the calculation of the full cost ceiling limitation are determined based upon estimates of proved oil and gas reserves  future prices  and the costs to extract these reserves 
downward revisions in estimated reserve quantities  increases in future cost estimates or depressed oil and gas prices could cause us to reduce the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess must be charged to expense 
this is referred to as the full cost ceiling limitation 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even if higher oil and gas prices subsequently increase the full cost ceiling limitation 
at the end of each quarter  a full cost ceiling limitation calculation is made 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires an annual impairment assessment 
a more frequent assessment is required if certain events occur that reasonably indicate an impairment may have occurred 
the volatility of oil and gas prices may cause more frequent assessments 
the impairment assessment requires us to make estimates regarding the fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value is based on numerous factors  including future net cash flows of our estimates of proved reserves as well as the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves 
these factors are each individually weighted to estimate the total fair value of the reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value  then a measurement of the loss must be performed  with any deficiency recorded as an impairment 
we recorded million of goodwill in the purchase of key on september  to date  no impairment has been recorded 
contingencies a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes subjective judgment 
in many cases  this judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
we closely monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingencies and periodically determine when we should record losses for these items based on information available to us 
as of december   no liabilities have been accrued for known contingencies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting developments in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  requiring companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation to employees for fiscal periods after june  this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we currently provide in our notes to consolidated financial statements pro forma information regarding net income as if the compensation cost for our stock option plans had been determined in accordance with the fair value based method prescribed in sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
we anticipate adopting the provisions of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of and that the impact  based on outstanding options at december   will result in future charges to compensation expense similar to the pro forma amounts reflected in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes  thus reducing tax expense in the periods the deductions are deductible on the tax return and not as an adjustment of recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities 
overview our results of operations are impacted by oil and gas prices  which are volatile 
realized oil and gas prices increased from per bbl and per mcf in to per bbl and per mcf in the majority of our revenues are from oil and gas sales  so price fluctuations can significantly affect our financial results 
marketing sales and related purchases pertain to activities with third parties conducted by our marketing group 
natural gas sales transactions are conducted with various purchasers under a variety of terms and conditions and supplied by purchasing gas from other producers and marketing companies 
for the sales transactions in which the gas is supplied by our own production  related sales and costs are reflected in cimarex s gas sales and transportation expense 
transportation expenses are comprised of costs paid to carry and deliver oil and gas to a specified delivery point 
in some cases we receive a payment from purchasers  which is net of transportation costs  and in other instances we separately pay for transportation 
if costs are netted in the proceeds received  both the revenues and costs are shown gross in sales and expenses  respectively 
production costs are composed of lease operating expenses  which generally consist of pumpers salaries  utilities  maintenance and other costs necessary to operate our producing properties 
taxes other than income are taxes assessed by applicable taxing authorities pertaining to production  revenues or the value of our properties 
these typically include production severance  ad valorem and excise taxes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of our producing properties is computed using the unit of production method 
because the economic life of each producing well depends upon the assumed price for production  fluctuations in oil and gas prices may impact the level of proved reserves used in the calculation 
higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves  which reduces depletion  while lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves  which increases depletion 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  office rent  legal fees  consultants  systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our offices 
while we expect such costs to increase with our growth  we expect such increases to be proportionately smaller than our production growth 
stock compensation expense consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees 
basis of presentation cimarex was formed in february as a wholly owned subsidiary of helmerich payne  inc  or h p 
in july  h p contributed its oil and gas exploration and production assets and the common stock of cimarex energy services  inc cesi to cimarex 
on september   h p distributed in the form of a dividend to h p stockholders approximately million shares of cimarex common stock 
as a result  cimarex was spun off and became a stand alone company 
also on september   cimarex acquired percent of the outstanding common stock of key production company  inc  or key 
the transaction was treated as a tax free reorganization and accounted for as a purchase business combination 
in the merger  we issued million shares of cimarex common stock on a one for one basis for percent of the shares of key common stock outstanding 
key continues to conduct exploration and development activities as a wholly owned subsidiary of cimarex 
because the merger was accounted for as a purchase business combination  the financial and operating results presented in this report on form k  unless expressly noted otherwise  include key only for the period subsequent to the merger on september  on september   cimarex changed its fiscal year from september to december effective january  financial statements included in this report show results of operations for the years ended december   and results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  summary data for the years ended december  in thousands or as indicated net income per share basic per share diluted gas sales oil sales total oil and gas sales total gas volume mmcf gas volume mmcf per day average gas price per mcf total oil volume thousand barrels oil volume barrels per day average oil price per barrel marketing sales marketing purchases marketing margin other  net depreciation  depletion and amortization production transportation taxes other than income general and administrative stock compensation asset retirement obligation accretion we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  in compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the primary reason for this increase in net income is the increase in revenues from oil and gas sales 
these sales for equaled million  compared to million in the million increase in sales between the two years consists of million related to higher oil and gas prices  and million associated with increased production volumes 
realized gas prices averaged per mcf for  compared to per mcf for this percent increase had an incremental effect on sales of million between the two years 
realized oil prices averaged per barrel for  compared to per barrel for the effect on sales between years resulting from this percent improvement in oil prices totaled million 
higher prices were the direct result of overall market conditions 
we have not entered into any derivative contracts or hedges with respect to our production 
oil and gas sales also benefited from higher production volumes 
average gas volumes rose mmcf per day in to mmcf per day from mmcf per day in  resulting in million of incremental revenues 
oil volumes averaged  barrels per day in  compared to  barrels per day in  resulting in increased revenues of million 
the increase in overall sales volumes between the two years is due to positive drilling results during average daily production contributed from wells drilled during totaled mmcfe  which largely offset natural declines 
marketing sales net of related purchases equaled million in compared to million in these sales relate to marketing activities with outside parties conducted by our marketing group 
the financial impact from these activities is small relative to our overall results of operations 
the marketing margin in was favorably impacted by wide fluctuations in gas prices 
revenues and costs related to marketing of our own production are eliminated in consolidation 
other revenues and expenses net equaled million in  consisting primarily of million of net gains from the sale of inventory and million of net gains from the settlement of various litigation 
costs and expenses other than income tax expense overall costs and expenses not including income taxes were million in compared to million in the largest component of this million increase between years is a million increase in total depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a from million in to million in  resulting from higher costs for reserves added during on a unit of production basis  dd a was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe for taxes other than income were million greater  rising from million in to million in this increase resulted from a percent jump in oil and gas sales stemming from higher product prices and volumes 
production costs rose million from million in to million in due primarily to the installation and operation of additional compressors primarily in kansas to enhance production  higher field operating expenses from an expanded number of properties  and higher maintenance costs 
general and administrative g a expenses increased million from million in to million in  due to an expansion of staff as a result of a larger drilling program  higher employee benefit costs  and higher consulting fees 
smaller variances of costs between years include stock compensation related to amortization of costs of restricted stock  slightly increasing by 
million between years from in to million in  and accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations  increasing by 
million from million in to million in asset retirement obligations were recorded with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  on january  income tax expense income tax expense totaled million for versus million for tax expense equaled a combined federal and state effective income tax rate of percent and percent in and  respectively 
the increase in effective rates results from greater utilization of tax credits in we estimate that million of our income tax expense is current

the increase in overall sales volumes between the two years is due to the key acquisition and positive drilling results during prior to the acquisition  sales volumes for the first three quarters of averaged mmcfe per day 
with the inclusion of key s volumes in the fourth quarter of  production increased to mmcfe per day 
average daily production contributed from wells drilled during totaled mmcfe  which largely offset natural declines

production costs rose million from million in to million in due to the acquisition of key s properties and higher workover costs incurred during for the maintenance of our wells 
the mix of key s wells included proportionately more oil wells  which generally cost more to operate because of additional pumping and electricity charges 
general and administrative g a expenses increased million from million in to million in  due to the larger organization resulting from the key acquisition as well as the expanded drilling program that has been implemented 
stock compensation related to amortization of restricted stock costs increased by million between years  because the majority of the restricted stock and stock units were issued in december accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations was million in asset retirement obligations were recorded with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  on january  income tax expense income tax expense totaled million for versus million for tax expense equaled a combined federal and state effective income tax rate of percent and percent in and  respectively 
the increase in effective rates results from greater utilization of tax credits in we estimate that million of our income tax expense is current 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows our primary source of capital is cash flow generated from operating activities 
prices we receive for future oil and gas sales and our level of production will impact these future cash flows 
no prediction can be made as to the prices we will receive 
production volumes will in part be dependent upon the amount of future capital expenditures 
in turn  actual levels of capital expenditures may vary due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  prices and availability of goods and services  and the extent to which proved properties are acquired 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in from the earlier periods results primarily from higher prices and production 
higher revenues from oil and gas sales funded our exploration and development expenditure program for the year  and built a larger balance of cash at year end than we held in cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in stems from a larger exploration and development program 
cash flow provided by financing activities in was million versus million used in financing activities in  a change of million 
the most significant item that occurred during was the repayment of million of bank debt 
cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  were million 
financial condition as of december   stockholders equity totaled million  up from million at december  the increase resulted primarily from net income of million 
during we increased our cash balance by million from million at december  to million at december  working capital working capital at december  totaled million  compared to million at december  the largest component of this increase was the higher cash balance that resulted from cash flow provided by operating activities 
receivables comprise another significant portion of our working capital  totaling million at december  our receivables are from a diverse group of companies including major energy companies  pipeline companies  local distribution companies and end users in various industries 
the collection of receivables has been timely  and associated losses historically have not being significant 
financing in october  we closed on a three year million senior secured revolving credit facility 
the facility had a borrowing base of million and we elected a million commitment amount 
the borrowing base was subject to re determination each april and october 
borrowings under this facility bore interest at a libor rate plus percent to percent  based on borrowing base usage 
unused borrowings were subject to a commitment fee of percent to percent  also depending on borrowing base usage 
the credit facility was secured by mortgages on our oil and gas properties and the stock of our subsidiaries 
we were also subject to customary financial and non financial covenants 
we are in compliance with all such covenants 
there were no borrowings under the facility at december  and on october  the facility was amended 
the amendment maintains a million commitment amount  however it increases the borrowing base from million to million 
the amendment also extends the term to october and does not require any additional mortgages unless outstanding borrowings exceed percent of the borrowing base 
borrowings under the amended facility bear interest at a libor rate plus percent to percent  based on borrowing base usage 
unused borrowings under the amendment are subject to a commitment fee of percent to percent  also depending on borrowing base usage 
because we have no publicly traded debt  we have not sought a corporate credit rating 
contractual obligations and material commitments at december   we had contractual obligations and material commitments as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases drilling commitments asset retirement obligation other liabilities total obligations we have guaranteed delivery of bcf of natural gas from wells over a rolling three year period as reimbursement for connection costs to a pipeline 
if the minimum delivery is not met  our maximum exposure is approximately million 
we have also agreed to reimburse another gatherer for connection costs to its pipeline via delivery of bcf of natural gas per well for wells 
the maximum amount that would be payable  if no gas is delivered  would be approximately million 
based on current commodity prices and anticipated levels of production  we believe that the estimated net cash generated from operations  coupled with the cash on hand and amounts available under our existing line of credit  will be adequate to meet future liquidity needs  including satisfying our financial obligations and funding our operations and exploration and development activities 
outlook our projected exploration and development expenditure program of million will require a great deal of coordination and effort 
though there are a variety of factors that could curtail  delay or even cancel some of our drilling operations  we believe our projected program has a high degree of occurrence 
the majority of projects are in hand  drilling rigs are being scheduled  and the historical results of our drilling efforts in these areas warrant pursuit of the projects 
costs of operations on a per mcfe basis for are estimated to approximate levels realized in should factors beyond our control fluctuate  our program and realized costs will vary from current projections 
these factors could include volatility in commodity prices  changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  weather conditions  governmental regulations and more 
estimates of production levels for range between to mmcfe per day 
the revenues to be realized from the sale of this production will be dependent not only on the level of oil and gas actually produced  but also the prices that will be realized from the sales 
during  the average price realized from our gas sales was per mcf and per barrel from our oil sales 
current indications are that anticipated prices for should approximate levels 
prices can be highly volatile  however  and the possibility of realized prices for to vary from current estimates is high 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk price fluctuations our results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices we receive for oil and gas production  and those prices are constantly changing in response to market forces 
nearly all of our revenue is from the sale of oil and gas  so these fluctuations  positive and negative  can have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
oil and gas price realizations for ranged from a monthly low of per mcf and per barrel  to a monthly high of per mcf and per barrel  respectively 
it is impossible to predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
if we wanted to attempt to smooth out the effect of commodity price fluctuations  we could enter into non speculative hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  forward sale contracts  commodity futures  options and other similar agreements 
to date  we have not used any of these financial instruments to mitigate commodity price changes 
any sustained weakness in prices may affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities and could cause us to record a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
interest rate risk cimarex may be exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our variable rate bank credit facility 
however  because we presently have no debt outstanding  the potential effect changes in interest rates would have no effect on our results of operations
