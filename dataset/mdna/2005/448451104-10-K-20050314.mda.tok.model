item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview huttig is a distributor of building materials used principally in new residential construction and in home improvement  remodeling  and repair work 
we distribute our products through distribution centers serving states and are sold primarily to building materials dealers  national buying groups  home centers and industrial users including makers of manufactured homes 
industry conditions various factors historically have caused our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
these factors include levels of construction  home improvement and remodeling activity  weather  prices of commodity wood products  interest rates  competitive pressures  availability of credit and other local  regional and economic conditions 
many of these factors are cyclical or seasonal in nature 
we anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
our first quarter and  occasionally  our fourth quarter are adversely affected by winter weather patterns in the midwest  mid atlantic and northeast  which typically result in seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas 
because much of our overhead and expenses remain relatively fixed throughout the year  our operating profits also tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters 
we believe we have the product offerings  warehouse and builder support facilities  personnel  systems infrastructure and financial and competitive resources necessary for continued business success 
our future revenues  costs and profitability  however  are all likely to be influenced by a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under cautionary statement 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management bases these estimates and assumptions on historical results and known trends  as well as our expectations as to how these might change in the future 
actual results could differ from these estimates  assumptions and expectations 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable consist of amounts owed for orders shipped to customers and are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
huttig s corporate management establishes an overall credit policy for sales to customers and is responsible for all credit decisions 
the reserve for bad debt is determined based on a number of factors including when customer accounts exceed days past due or sooner depending on the credit strength of the customer 
our credit policies  together with monitoring of customer balances  have resulted in average bad debt expense of approximately of net sales during the last three years 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we review inventories on hand and record a provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on historical and expected sales 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets we test the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
the carrying value of goodwill is considered impaired when the discounted cash flow is less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of goodwill 
we test the carrying value of other long lived assets  including intangible and other tangible assets  for impairment when events and circumstances warrant such review 
the carrying value of long lived assets are considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
contingencies we accrue expenses when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the expense 
contingencies for which we have made accruals include environmental  product liability and other legal matters 
based on management s assessment of the most recent information available  management currently does not expect any of these contingencies to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or cash flow 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period and our financial condition could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or other circumstances related to these matters 
we accrue our best estimate of the cost of resolution of these matters and make adjustments to the amounts accrued as circumstances change 
insurance we carry insurance policies on insurable risks with coverages and other terms that we believe are appropriate 
we generally have self insured retention limits and have obtained fully insured layers of coverage above such self insured retention limits 
accruals for self insurance losses are made based on our claims experience 
we accrue for these liabilities for existing and unreported claims when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and when we can estimate those costs 
supplier rebates we enter into agreements with certain vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates upon achievement of specified volume purchasing levels 
we record vendor rebates as a reduction of the cost of inventory purchased 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal continuing operations net sales from continuing operations were million  which was million  or  higher than same branch sales increased in over and sales in all product categories achieved double digit sales growth over the prior year 
millwork sales increased million  or  over the prior year to million  with interior and exterior doors up and  respectively 
other millwork products  primarily mouldings  columns and stairs  were up 
sales of building products increased million  or  from a year ago to million  led by increases in siding  decking and railings  fasteners and connectors  flashing  insulation  and housewrap 
wood products sales increased million  or  over the prior year to million  with engineered wood product sales up 
excluding the impact of wood and steel inflation  which contributed approximately million to sales growth  primarily in the first nine months of  sales from continuing operations increased from to increases in sales were achieved despite the impact of four hurricanes  which slowed construction in the third and fourth quarters in the southeast and mid atlantic regions 
by the end of  sales had begun rebounding in the affected regions and december sales were higher than the previous year 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of sales increased basis points to in  including lifo last in  first out expense of million  or  resulting from inflation in wood and steel prices as compared to lifo income of million in higher commodity wood and steel prices contributed approximately million  or  to the total increase in gross profit margin over a year ago 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in compared to in operating expenses were million in the current year  or million higher than the prior year 
personnel expense  which includes commissions  wages  benefits and bonuses  increased million in over  primarily associated with higher profitability and increased sales volume 
non personnel expense increased million  principally due to higher vehicle liability insurance reserves  outside service expenses  fuel costs  vehicle and machinery rent and maintenance  and supplies 
bad debt expense was million higher than we recognized a million gain on disposal of capital assets during from the sale of facilities  as we moved into larger  leased facilities 
during  we recorded a million gain on the sale of two facilities 
net interest expense was million in  which was million less than the decrease reflects the reduction in our effective borrowing rate and average debt outstanding compared to  resulting from entering into a new credit facility as stated in liquidity and capital resources 
during  we recorded a non cash charge of million to write off the remaining unamortized loan fees related to our previous credit facility  which we refinanced on september  as a result of the foregoing factors  pretax income from continuing operations increased by million to million in compared to million in income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income were and for and  respectively 
the decrease in the rate in versus was due to closing audits of our federal and state tax returns related to the years to the tax rate in is expected to be 
discontinued operations net sales from our discontinued operations of american pine products and builder resource branches were million in  compared with million in the decrease in sales was due to the sale of american pine products on august  and the sale of the builder resource branches in the kansas city area on august  operating income from our discontinued operations was million in compared with million in the profit improvement over the prior year came from american pine products  which benefited from million in additional sales and million of additional gross margin caused from wood inflation in the sale of these branches approximated net book value  with the gain on sale of these branches less than million 
fiscal compared to fiscal continuing operations net sales from continuing operations were million  which was million  or  higher than same branch sales increased in over sales in all product categories achieved double digit sales growth over the prior year with the exception of millwork 
wood products sales increased million  or  over the prior year to million 
sales of building products increased million  or  from a year ago to million  led by increases in siding  decking  fasteners and connectors  railings  flashing  insulation  and housewrap 
millwork sales increased by million  or over the prior year to million 
combined sales of exterior doors and interior doors were million higher than the prior year 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of sales slightly increased to compared with in the prior year 
the slight increase in gross margins percentage resulted from a shift in product mix and pricing pressures in certain regions 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in compared to in operating expenses were million in  or million higher than the personnel expense increased million in over  primarily associated with higher profitability and increased sales volume 
non personnel expense increased million  principally due to higher outside service expenses  fuel costs  vehicle and machinery rent and maintenance  and supplies 
in  we reduced bad debt expense by million versus depreciation and amortization was million for compared to million a year ago 
the increase primarily reflects the timing of our capital expenditures spending in the second half of for operating equipment replacements and for a warehouse logistics system implementation 
we recognized a million gain on disposal of capital assets during from the sale of two disposed facilities 
during  we recorded a million gain on the sale of vacant facilities 
net interest expense was million in  which was million less than the decrease reflects the reduction in our effective borrowing rate resulting from the expiration of our interest rate swaps in may average debt outstanding during was million versus million in during  we recorded a non cash charge of million to write off the remaining unamortized loan fees related to our previous credit facility  which we refinanced in august during  we recorded a million gain in the fair value of two interest rate swaps that did not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes 
these interest rate swaps expired in may during  we recorded a million gain on derivatives 
as a result of the foregoing factors  pretax income from continuing operations increased by million to million in compared to a pretax loss of million in income taxes were calculated at an effective rate of and for and  respectively 
discontinued operations net sales from our discontinued operations of american pine products and all builder resource branches were million in  compared with million in the decrease in sales was due to the negative impact from a new competitor in the kansas city area that commenced operations in the second quarter of and a decline in finished moulding sales prices in the second half of operating income from our discontinued operations was million in compared with million in the profit improvement over the prior year came from builder resource 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in  we incurred an after tax non cash charge of million due to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the write off of goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on cash flow from operations and funds available under our secured credit facility to finance seasonal working capital needs  capital expenditures and any acquisitions that we may undertake 
our working capital requirements are generally greatest in the second and third quarters  which reflect the seasonal nature of our business 
the second and third quarters are also typically our strongest operating quarters  largely due to more favorable weather throughout many of our markets compared to the first and fourth quarters 
we typically generate cash from working capital reductions in the fourth quarter of the year and build working capital during the first quarter in preparation for our second and third quarters 
we also maintain significant inventories to meet rapid delivery requirements of our customers and to enable us to obtain favorable pricing  delivery and service terms with our suppliers 
at december  and  inventories constituted approximately and of our total assets  respectively 
we also closely monitor operating expenses and inventory levels during seasonally affected periods and  to the extent possible  manage variable operating costs to minimize seasonal effects on our profitability 
operations cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations decreased by million to million for the year ended december   from million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects higher net income due to increased sales volume compared to the year ended december  offset by an increase in working capital 
accounts receivable increased during the year by million compared to an increase of million a year ago 
the year over year increase in accounts receivable related primarily to higher sales in the current year versus a year ago 
days sales outstanding improved by days to days from days in inventory increased during the year by million compared to a decrease of million last year 
most of the increase over was to support higher sales volume 
our inventory turns improved by a half turn to turns in from turns in accounts payable decreased by million during compared to a million decrease a year ago 
cash used in discontinued operations during was million compared to million used by discontinued operations in the million decrease in cash used was primarily due to the sale of the american pine products on august  and the sale of the builder resource branches in the kansas city area on august  investing cash provided from investing activities for reflects million in proceeds from the disposition of american pine products and our builder resource locations in the kansas city area and baltimore 
it also reflects the million of proceeds from the sale of three facilities  which were partially offset by million of capital expenditures for normal  continuing operating activities 
cash used in investing activities in reflects million of capital expenditures for normal operating activities  which were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of disposed facilities 
cash used in investing activities in reflects million of capital expenditures for normal operating activities and million for a warehouse logistics system implementation at selected branches  which were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of disposed facilities 
we expect to make capital expenditures at our branches for normal operating activities in in the range of million to million 
financing cash used in financing activities for reflects million of net payments on our revolving credit facilities  million of payments for our capital lease obligations  and million for debt issuance costs for our new credit agreement 
cash used in financing activities for reflects million of net payments on our revolving credit facilities and million of payments for our capital lease obligations  which was partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale leaseback of technology and production equipment 
cash used in financing activities in reflects million of net payments on our revolving credit facilities  million of payments for our capital lease obligations  million for debt issuance costs related to our former senior secured revolving credit facility  million of stock under our former stock repurchase program and million of stock from our repurchase of shares from a former employee  which uses of cash were partially offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in the second quarter of  we entered into a million four year capital lease obligation to re finance equipment under a previously existing operating lease  which also increased our fixed assets by million 
the equipment consisted of existing rolling stock  forklifts and production equipment 
on september   we refinanced certain indebtedness outstanding under our former credit facility using proceeds from a new  five year credit facility entered into among huttig  lasalle bank national association  as administrative agent  and the lenders party thereto the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a term loan of million and a revolving credit facility of million 
the revolving credit facility may be increased  subject to certain conditions  including bank approval  to a maximum availability of million 
the term loan facility provides for quarterly principal payments of million on december  and each march  june  september and december thereafter 
subject to certain exceptions  we are required to repay amounts outstanding under the credit agreement from the cash proceeds of asset dispositions  debt or equity securities issuances and insurance claims related to our real estate 
we must also pay a commitment fee in the range of to per annum on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit commitment 
the entire unpaid balance under the credit agreement is due and payable on september   the maturity date of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by huttig  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of huttig  and is secured by i a pledge to the administrative agent of the capital stock of huttig s subsidiaries  and ii the grant of security interests and liens on substantially all of the consolidated assets of huttig and our subsidiaries  excluding  among other things  certain specified real estate assets 
at any time after we have delivered our audited financial statements to the lending group  if we obtain an investment rating from standard poor s of bbb  moody s investor service of baa or fitch s rating agency of bbb  the administrative agent and the lenders will consider  at our request  the release of all the collateral securing the credit agreement 
the indebtedness under the credit agreement would then be a general unsecured obligation of huttig 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants  including a fixed charge coverage ratio  a senior debt to ebitda ratio  an asset coverage ratio  and a tangible net worth ratio 
the credit agreement also contains restrictive covenants pertaining to the management and operations of huttig and its subsidiaries 
the covenants include  among others  limitations on indebtedness  guarantees  letters of credit  liens  investments  distributions  mergers  acquisitions  asset sales  fundamental corporate changes  transactions with affiliates  and issuance of stock 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
the credit agreement provides for events of default customary in facilities of this type  including i failure to make payments when due  ii default by huttig or our subsidiaries under any agreement relating to indebtedness in excess of million  iii default by huttig or our subsidiaries under material contracts for the purchase or sale of goods  iv bankruptcy defaults  v breach of covenants  vi breach of representations or warranties in any material respect when made  vii erisa defaults  viii judgments in excess of million  ix any collateral document ceasing to be in full force and effect or any security interest or lien created thereby ceasing to be enforceable and of the same effect and priority purported to be created thereby  and x any subordination provision governing subordinated debt or a guaranty of subordinated debt ceasing to be in full force and effect 
proceeds from the credit agreement were used to repay in full the outstanding balance on the former credit agreement dated as of august   among huttig  the domestic subsidiaries of huttig party thereto  the lending institutions party thereto  jp morgan business credit corp  as advisor  jpmorgan chase bank  as administrative agent and collateral agent  and the other agents party thereto 
the obligations repaid totaled approximately million when the former credit agreement was terminated effective as of september  as of december   we had revolving credit borrowings of million  at an interest rate of and million outstanding on the term loan  at an interest rate of under the new credit agreement 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which expires in september  which mirrors the amortization of the million term loan and provides a fixed rate of interest of plus the applicable borrowing spread of between and basis points above libor 
this interest rate swap is used to hedge interest rate risks related to our variable rate term loan and is accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
we believe that cash generated from our operations and funds available under our credit facility will provide sufficient funds to meet our currently anticipated short term and long term liquidity and capital expenditure requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements in addition to funds available from operating cash flows  and bank credit agreements as described above  we use a principal off balance sheet technique operating leases 
operating leases are employed as an alternative to purchasing certain property  plant and equipment 
future rental commitments  extending through the year  under all non cancelable operating leases in effect at december   total million 
divestitures on august   we sold to woodgrain millwork  inc substantially all of the assets  but excluding the land  buildings and building improvements  of american pine products  a mouldings manufacturing facility in prineville  oregon 
we received sale proceeds of million  which we used to pay trade payables that we retained and reduce debt 
we also entered into a ten year lease with woodgrain millwork  inc for the land  building and building improvements with an option for woodgrain to renew the lease for an additional five year period 
woodgrain will be required to purchase the land  buildings and building improvements if the oregon department of environmental quality issues  prior to the expiration of the lease term  a no further action letter with respect to certain soil and groundwater contamination previously discovered  however  we can give no assurance that this letter will be obtained 
american pine products was reported as discontinued operations and the related assets  excluding land  building and building improvements  at the facility were classified as held for sale effective july  the date of the definitive agreement 
we also entered into a non exclusive supply agreement with woodgrain 
see commitments and contingencies 
on august   we sold the operations and certain assets  including inventory and equipment  of our builder resource branches located in the kansas city area to mccray lumber company 
we received million  which we used to pay trade payables we retained and reduce debt 
we retained accounts receivable of approximately million and collected million through december  as of february   million  net of reserves  of the retained accounts receivable remained 
all of the builder resource branches in the kansas city area were reported as discontinued operations and the related assets were classified as held for sale effective august  on december   we sold the operations and certain assets  including inventory and equipment  of our builder resource branch in baltimore to builder resource supply corporation  an entity owned by the previous general manager of the branch 
we received cash proceeds of  at closing and we financed the cost of inventory and the book value of other acquired assets in excess of  for a term of five years with a simple interest loan with interest accruing at per annum 
we retained the accounts receivable of this business  which approximates million 
as of february   million  net of reserves  of the retained accounts receivable remained 
as of september   we reported this branch as a discontinued operation and related assets were classified as held for sale effective september  on february   we sold operations and certain assets  including accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and real property  of our four one step branches located in tennessee and alabama to hendricks companies  inc for million in cash and are expected to report a net after tax gain of approximately million 
we will use the proceeds of the sale to reduce debt 
we reported these branches as discontinued operations and related assets were classified as held for sale effective december  subsequent events on january   huttig  through our wholly owned subsidiary  huttig texas limited partnership  completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of texas wholesale building materials for million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement signed on january  texas wholesale operates a  square foot distribution center in dallas 
the purchase price will be allocated to the underlying assets and certain liabilities based on their estimated fair values 
the resulting goodwill from this transaction is currently estimated at million 
the goodwill estimate is preliminary  pending the results of appraisals and further financial analysis 
for the year ended december   texas wholesale had sales of approximately million and net income of approximately million 
the source of funds for the acquisition was through our existing credit facility 
the texas wholesale acquisition represents our first full line distribution operation in the state of texas  in accordance with our acquisition strategy 
as stated above  on february   we sold operations and certain assets  including accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and real property  of our four one step branches located in tennessee and alabama to hendricks companies  inc commitments and contingencies the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including current portion capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations severance obligations total amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt approximates book value because interest rates on nearly all of the outstanding borrowings are frequently reset every to days 
on august   we sold to woodgrain millwork  inc substantially all of the assets  but excluding the land  buildings and building improvements  of american pine products  a mouldings manufacturing facility in prineville  oregon 
we also entered into a non exclusive supply agreement with woodgrain under which we have agreed to purchase mouldings  doors  windows  door frames and other millwork products from woodgrain for a period of five years at market prices 
during the first two years  we have an agreement to purchase a minimum of million in each year 
thereafter  the supply agreement requires that we purchase a certain minimum unit volume of certain products from woodgrain and requires the sale of such products at competitive market prices for domestic and offshore products  and with minimum required lead times 
the minimum volume requirements represent less than half of our current overall requirements for such products 
if woodgrain is unable to meet our needs  such products are readily available from other suppliers 
if we do not meet the minimum purchase requirements during the first two years  we will have to pay a penalty of  management change and terms of separation severance expense of million was recorded in the first quarter of as part of operating expenses for payments  including future payments  to the company s former president and chief executive officer and other employees whose employment terminated during the quarter ended march  an additional severance expense of million was recorded in the third and fourth quarters for the termination of employees related to the consolidation of branches and the reorganization of corporate headquarters staff 
during the twelve months ended december  and  total severance payments of million and million  respectively  were paid 
the remaining severance payments totaled million at december   and will be paid by march  new accounting pronouncements in december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 revised statement r share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
statement r requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair market values 
statement r is effective for huttig beginning july  as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
previously  if costs were so abnormal they were required to be expensed in the current period and not to be capitalized into inventory 
this statement requires that those items mentioned above to be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
adoption is required for years beginning after june  this new accounting pronouncement will not have an effect on our financial condition or results of the operations 
cautionary statement relevant to forward looking information for the purpose of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report on form k and our annual report to shareholders contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including but not limited to statements regarding the effect of known contingencies  including risks relating to environmental and legal proceedings  on our financial condition  cash flow and results of operations  the future impact of competition  our ability to maintain favorable terms with our suppliers and transition to alternative suppliers of building products  and the effects of slower economic activity on our results of operations  our future business success  sales volume and growth  product mix and results of operations  our liquidity and exposure to market risk  the likelihood and timing of any divestitures  our expectations of the contribution of the texas wholesale business to our results of operations  and cyclical and seasonal trends 
the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  believe  estimate  project or similar expressions identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements present management s expectations  beliefs  plans and objectives regarding our future business and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are based on current projections  estimates  assumptions and judgments  and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward looking statements 
there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following our sales and profitability depend significantly on new residential construction and home improvement activity in markets in which we compete  which is highly cyclical and seasonal 
our sales depend heavily on the strength of national and local new residential construction and home improvement and remodeling markets 
the strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and residential renovation projects  which are a function of many factors beyond our control 
some of these factors include employment levels  interest rates  availability of credit  housing prices  prices of commodity wood products  immigration patterns  regional demographics and consumer confidence 
future downturns in the markets that we serve or in the economy generally could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
reduced levels of construction activity may result in intense price competition among building materials suppliers  which may adversely affect our gross margins 
our first quarter revenues and  to a lesser extent  our fourth quarter revenues are typically adversely affected by winter construction cycles and weather patterns in colder climates as the level of activity in the new construction and home improvement markets decreases 
because much of our overhead and expense remains relatively fixed throughout the year  our operating profits also tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters 
the building materials distribution industry is extremely competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully with some of our existing competitors or new entrants in the markets we serve 
the building materials distribution industry is extremely competitive 
our competition varies by product line  customer classification and geographic market 
the principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and availability of product  service and delivery capabilities  ability to assist with problem solving  customer relationships  geographic coverage  and breadth of product offerings 
also  financial stability and geographic coverage are important to manufacturers in choosing distributors for their products 
we compete with many local  regional and  in some markets and product categories  national building materials distributors and dealers 
we also compete with major integrated product manufacturers with national distribution capability  such as bluelinx  weyerhaeuser and boise cascade 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources and may be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we can 
we also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants 
we can give no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors 
the termination of key supplier relationships may have an immediate adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we distribute building materials that we purchase from a number of major suppliers 
as is customary in our industry  most of our relationships with these suppliers are terminable without cause on short notice 
although we believe that relationships with our existing suppliers are strong and that we would have access to similar products from competing suppliers  any disruption in our sources of supply  particularly of our most commonly sold items  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we also can give no assurance that any supply shortages resulting from unanticipated demand or production difficulties will not occur from time to time or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to generate sufficient earnings in order to comply with availability requirements and financial covenants under our revolving credit facility  our ability to conduct business would be limited and we could be forced to seek alternative sources of financing 
our credit facility agreement contains various covenants  which  among other things  limit our ability to incur indebtedness  incur liens  make certain types of acquisitions  declare or pay dividends or make restricted payments  consolidate  merge or sell assets 
it also contains financial covenants tied to our borrowing base 
our financial results in the near term may vary from those required by our credit facility as a result of the risks we face in our business  including those that may prevent us from achieving the levels of ebitda required under our credit facility 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to achieve sufficient ebitda or other financial results necessary to satisfy our revolving credit facility covenants 
if we were unable to comply with these covenants  our lender would have the right  but not the obligation  to accelerate the repayment of the entire amount outstanding under the credit facility 
fluctuation in prices of commodity wood and steel products that we buy and then resell may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
our business directly faces the risk of periodic fluctuations in the prices of wood and steel commodities 
changes in wood and steel commodity prices between the time we buy these products and the time we resell them have occurred in the past and we expect fluctuations to occur again in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage these fluctuations effectively or minimize any impact of these changes on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks of incurring significant costs to comply with environmental regulations 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental protection laws and regulations and may have to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the clean up of contamination at a formerly owned property in montana  where we are voluntarily remediating this property under the oversight of the montana department of environmental quality 
until the deq selects and orders us to implement a final remedy  we can give no assurance as to the scope or cost to us of any final remediation order 
see part i  item  legal proceedings  for additional discussion 
in addition  some of our current and former distribution centers are located in areas of current or former industrial activity where environmental contamination may have occurred  and for which we  among others  could be held responsible 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the clean up of possible contamination at a currently owned property in oregon 
upon completing our investigation  if necessary  we will remediate the property under the oversight of the oregon department of environmental quality 
because our review is in its initial stage  we are unable  at this time  to determine whether any remediation or other action may be necessary or to estimate the cost  if any  to remediate this property 
see part i  item  legal proceedings  for additional discussion 
we can give no assurance that we will have no material environmental liabilities with respect to any of our current or former distribution center locations in the future 
we face the risks that product liability claims and other legal proceedings relating to the products we distribute may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as is the case with other companies in our industry  we face the risk of product liability and other claims of the type that are typical to our industry  such as asbestos and mold related claims  in the event that the use of products that we have distributed causes personal injury or other damages 
product liability claims in the future  regardless of their ultimate outcome and whether or not they are covered under our insurance policies or may be indemnified by our suppliers  could result in costly litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management  sales and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees or our failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our risk of accidents 
the company retains a portion of the accident risk under vehicle liability  workers compensation and other insurance programs 
accruals are based on our best estimate of the cost of resolution of these matters and are adjusted periodically as circumstances change 
there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
changes in the estimates of these accruals are charged or credited to earnings in the period determined 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risk as it relates to effects of changes in interest rates 
we had debt outstanding at december  under our secured revolving credit facility of million and a term loan of million 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which will expire in september  which mirrors the amortization of the million term loan and provides a fixed rate of interest of plus the applicable borrowing spread of between and basis points above libor 
this interest rate swap is used to hedge interest rate risks related to our variable rate term loan and is accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
included in other income for the year ended december   is million of an unrealized gain related to the portion of our former interest rate swap agreements  which did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment according to the sfas no 
criteria 
this unrealized gain resulted in an increase to diluted earnings per share of in the year ended december  these interest rate swap agreements expired in may all of our bank debt under our secured revolving credit facility accrues interest at a floating rate basis of between and basis points above libor 
if market interest rates for libor had been different by an average of for the twelve months ended december   our interest expense and income before taxes would have changed by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost 
this analysis does not consider the effects of any change in the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure 
we are subject to periodic fluctuations in the price of wood and steel commodities 
profitability is influenced by these changes as prices change between the time we buy and sell the wood or steel 
in addition  to the extent changes in interest rates affect the housing and remodeling market  we would be affected by such changes
