item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
since the launch of the blueprint for growth strategy  we have gained some important insights 
we have learned that to achieve our aspiration of sustainable core revenue growth of to  we need to be even more intensely focused on our customers success 
we have always had a customer focus  but now we are intensifying that focus 
to better reflect our commitment to our customers success  we evolved our aspiration in our aspiration is now to be the most trusted source of business insight so our customers can decide with confidence 
our intention to become a growth company has not changed 
but this aspiration provides the way for us to achieve growth and create value for our shareholders 
while our aspiration has shifted focus  our underlying strategy remains the same as when we launched it in october our blueprint for growth strategy is the roadmap to our aspiration 
this strategy has five components  which we believe  taken together  will drive our financial performance build a winning culture  leverage our brand  create financial flexibility  enhance our current business  and become an important player in e business 
for the reasons described further below  we believe that our winning culture  our brand and our flexible business model are assets that form a powerful competitive advantage that enable us to drive and lead through change as an organization 
build a winning culture by building a winning culture  we are transforming d b tm into a company focused on winning in the marketplace and creating shareholder value 
we believe that superb leadership will enable our transformation by driving the results that will lead to the achievement of our aspiration 
to build superb leadership  we have developed and deployed a consistent  principles based leadership model throughout our company 
our leadership development process ensures that team member performance goals and financial rewards are linked to our blueprint for growth strategy 
it also enables team members to receive ongoing feedback on their performance goals and on their leadership 
all team members are expected to have personal leadership action plans that are focused on their own personal development  building on their leadership strengths and working on their areas of development 
we also have a talent assessment process that provides a framework to assess and improve skill levels and performance across the organization and acts as a tool to aid talent development and succession planning 
to measure our progress  we have an employee survey mechanism that enables team members worldwide to give feedback on our progress in building a winning culture 
we believe that our passion around improving our leadership daily to win in the marketplace is a competitive advantage that will help us achieve our aspiration 
leverage our brand we believe that the d b brand tm stands for confidence our customers rely on d b tm when they make critical business decisions 
this confidence is the product of dunsright tm  our unique  proprietary quality process that powers all of our customer solution sets 
through our dunsright tm quality process  our customers have access to comprehensive business information that we constantly endeavor to make more accurate  complete  timely and consistent  globally 
we believe that our quality process is the best in our industry 
the foundation of our dunsright tm quality process is quality assurance which includes over  separate automated and manual checks to ensure that data meets our high quality standards 
in addition  five quality drivers work sequentially to enhance the data and make it useful to our customers in making critical business decisions 
each of these quality drivers is described below first  by leveraging our core competency in global data collection  we bring together data from thousands of sources worldwide and enhance it into quality information to help our customers make profitable decisions 
we have the world s largest global business database  with over million businesses in over countries  including over million business records in the united states 
we update our database more than million times a day 
as a result  we provide our customers a one stop shop for global business data from around the world 
we integrate the data into our database through our patented entity matching process  which produces a single  more accurate picture of each business 
entity matching ensures that disparate data elements are associated with the right businesses in our database by doing such things as allowing and correcting for variations in spelling  format  trade names and addresses 
we apply our nine digit global d u n s tm number as a unique means of identifying and tracking a business globally through every step in the life and activity of the business 
we use the d u n s tm number to link headquarters  branches  parents and subsidiaries 
in today s global economy  the d u n s tm number has become a standard for business identification and verification 
the d u n s tm number is exclusively ours and is never reassigned to another business 
it follows a business through every phase of its life  including bankruptcy  and allows verification of information at every stage of the dunsright tm quality process 
we use the corporate linkage process to enable our customers to view their total risk or opportunity across related business entities 
linkage means we view each entity in relation to its corporate family  providing our customers with increased awareness of risk exposure  new opportunities to penetrate existing customers  and increased leverage with their suppliers 
finally  our predictive indicators use statistical analysis to rate a business s past performance and to indicate how the business is likely to perform in the future 
as an example  predictive indicators are used to predict the likelihood of a company going out of business or not paying its bills 
by providing predictive indicators  we make the information in our database even more actionable for our customers 
with the power of our dunsright tm quality process at its foundation  we believe the d b brand tm is another competitive advantage that will help us achieve our aspiration 
create financial flexibility as part of our blueprint for growth strategy  we continually seek opportunities to reallocate our spending to activities that drive revenue growth while  at the same time  improving our profitability 
we view almost every dollar that we spend as flexible 
what we mean is that we view very little of our costs as fixed we make a conscious decision about every investment we make 
through the structured process we call creating financial flexibility  we continually and systematically seek ways to improve our performance in terms of quality and cost 
specifically  we seek to eliminate  standardize  consolidate  and automate our business functions  or migrate them to the web 
after we have realized internal efficiencies  we evaluate the possibility that others can provide improved quality and greater efficiencies through outsourcing 
as part of our financial flexibility programs  we have eliminated non core operations  such as our receivable management services business  which we sold during  consolidated data collection telecenters  automated and simplified data collection handled both internally and from third party data sources  and outsourced certain technology functions  including our data center operations and systems development  as well as certain portions of our data acquisition and delivery  customer service  and financial processes 
since the launch of our blueprint for growth strategy  we have implemented several financial flexibility programs 
in each of these programs we identified ways to reduce our expense base  then reallocated some of the identified spending to other areas of our operations to improve revenue growth 
with each program we have incurred a restructuring charge which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations and transition costs which consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees  costs of temporary workers  relocation costs and stay bonuses 
the initial impact of each program on our expense base before any restructuring charges and transition costs and before any reallocation of spending  and the related restructuring charge and transition costs for each program  are as follows in  we initially reduced our expense base by million on an annualized basis before any reallocation of spending 
our actions resulted in a million restructuring charge in  of which million was reversed in as excess 
our actions also resulted in million of transition costs incurred primarily in in  we initially reduced our expense base by million on an annualized basis before any reallocation of spending 
our actions resulted in a million restructuring charge in our actions also resulted in an aggregate of million of transition costs primarily in and in  we initially reduced our expense base by million on an annualized basis before any reallocation of spending 
our actions resulted in a million restructuring charge in and in an aggregate of million of transition costs in and in  we initially reduced our expense base by million on an annualized basis before any reallocation of spending 
our actions resulted in an aggregate of million of restructuring charges in and an aggregate of million of transition costs in and in  we initially reduced our expense base by million on an annualized basis before any reallocation of spending 
our actions resulted in an aggregate of million of restructuring charges in and in million of transition costs in see note of our consolidated financial statements 
in our financial flexibility program we anticipate incurring approximately million of additional restructuring charges for severance and other termination costs and approximately million of additional transition costs for the program actions  primarily due to our outsourcing initiative to international business machines corporation announced in october in february  we announced plans to create additional financial flexibility through improving operating efficiency with a focus on evaluating opportunities in the international segment and leveraging current outsourcing partners and vendors to drive quality and cost efficiencies primarily in the area of technology 
once fully implemented  we expect these actions to reduce our expense base by million to million annually  before any restructuring charges and transition costs and before any reallocation of spending 
to implement these measures related to our financial flexibility program and complete our financial flexibility program  we expect to incur transition costs of approximately million to million and incur restructuring charges of approximately million to million  of which million to million relate to employee terminations and million to million relate to leasehold terminations 
the decision about how much to reallocate to other areas of our operations to drive revenue growth is initially made as part of our annual business planning and budgeting process 
we then revisit the allocation of our expenditures over the course of the year 
we believe the success of our flexible business model is illustrated by a comparison of our financial results from the year our blueprint for growth strategy was launched through over the five year period  we incurred restructuring charges totaling million and transition costs totaling million  averaging in total approximately million per year 
even after incurring these charges and the loss of operating income associated with the sales of businesses  our operating income increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k for a more complete discussion of our financial results  including these restructuring charges 
in addition  the financial flexibility program provided us with the funds to invest in our core business and make selective acquisitions 
this allowed us to significantly increase our organic and core revenue over this period  with the result that our total revenue declined only slightly from  million in to  million in  notwithstanding the loss of revenue associated with the sale of non core businesses and the divestiture of businesses in furtherance of our international market leadership strategy 
further  since this process of continuous reengineering enables us to grow revenue at a faster rate than costs  our operating margin before non core gains and charges improved from in to in on a gaap basis  our operating margin was in and in see how we evaluate our performance below 
in addition to margin improvement  our process of continuous reengineering has improved the capital efficiency of our business model 
for example  by reducing infrastructure inefficiencies  fewer investments in capital and software are required to run the same operations 
leveraging partners in key markets  as we are doing internationally as described below see business segments international below  eliminates our capital requirements in partnership markets 
also  outsourcing investment intensive activities allows us to reduce our future investments in capital and software 
in  investments in capital and software accounted for of our total revenue 
this was reduced to of total revenue by as a result of our ability to provide funds for activities that drive growth while at the same time improving our profitability  we believe our flexible business model is another competitive advantage

first  we believe that the foundation we have built on our winning culture  our brand and our flexible business model will fuel our growth 
second  we believe that the marketplace needs what we provide  and that the opportunity to provide more is profound 
we believe that we fulfill fundamentally essential needs that are critical to the health of our customers businesses 
in addition to fulfilling essential needs for our customers  we believe a profound growth opportunity exists in the marketplace  because we believe that we can  over time  increase our penetration within existing customers and capture an increasing percentage of their spending against their own internal processes

see trends  risks and uncertainties below for risk factors associated with achieving our revenue growth aspiration 
business segments we report our business globally through two business segments north america which consists of our operations in the united states and canada  and international which consists of our operations in europe  asia pacific  and latin america 
north america 
our north america segment has offices and conducts operations in two countries 
this segment accounted for of our total revenue in international 
the international segment has offices in countries and independent correspondents  and conducts operations through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local players in more than additional countries 
the international segment accounted for of our total revenue in on january   we began managing our business in canada in the international segment 
we will report financial results in the new segment structure beginning with the results for the first quarter of and conform historical amounts to reflect the new segment structure 
as part of our ongoing effort to enhance our current business  we are implementing a focused market leadership strategy for our international segment  through which we intend to establish a leading competitive position in every major market 
we define a leading competitive position as one where we are  or we are partnered with a leading provider of risk management solutions  a leading provider of sales marketing solutions  and have the potential to grow both 
we use different approaches to improve our competitive position from market to market worldwide 
as part of this process  we evaluate our competitive position and potential in each country or market and determine whether we can best achieve our objectives through continued direct ownership of  and investment in  our local business  or by forming strategic relationships with local players 
since the launch of the blueprint for growth strategy  we have entered into strategic international relationships with strong local players in the following countries markets  which have strengthened our dunsright tm quality process and improved our competitive position in these markets in japan  australia  new zealand  malaysia and thailand  in korea  in indonesia  israel and the nordic region sweden  denmark  norway and finland  and in india  distribution channels in pakistan and the middle east  central europe germany  austria  switzerland  poland  hungary and the czech republic  iberia spain and portugal and france 
the success of our international market leadership strategy is illustrated by the growth in revenue and profitability of our ongoing businesses through see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a in this form k 
to assess this growth  we use a metric we call core revenue  which we define as total revenue less divested business revenue 
see also how we evaluate our performance below 
with this metric  once a business is sold  its revenue is classified as divested business revenue in all periods  not just prospectively from the period of sale 
our market leadership strategy has also benefited our profitability for two key reasons first  because the businesses we divested were  in the aggregate  less profitable than our ongoing businesses  and second  because our strategy provides ongoing opportunities for reengineering 
segment data and other information for the years ended december   and are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
each of our business segments is subject to a number of challenges  which are discussed in detail in the md a 
one of these challenges includes a recent tax increase in italy that is expected to significantly increase the cost of conducting our italian real estate information business in a discussion of this legislation and our plan for addressing the cost increase  is found in the md a under the section captioned segment results international 
how we evaluate our performance we use the following financial measures to evaluate our performance total revenue excluding the revenue of divested businesses is referred to as core revenue 
core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition  core revenue growth  excluding the effects of foreign exchange  is referred to as revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange 
we also separately analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components  organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions  results such as operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding restructuring charges whether recurring or non recurring and certain other items that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance 
we refer to these restructuring charges and other items as non core gains and charges  and net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles is referred to as free cash flow 
we believe core revenue is useful to management and investors because it provides an indication of the underlying direction of changes in revenue in a single performance measure without reported revenue of divested businesses which will not be included in future revenue 
management believes that this measure provides valuable insight into our revenue from ongoing operations and enables investors to evaluate business performance and trends by facilitating a comparison of results of ongoing operations with past reports of financial results 
in addition  this measure is used by management to evaluate performance for compensation purposes 
we also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because  while we take steps to manage our exposure to foreign currency  we believe that it is useful to our investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another both with and without the effects of foreign exchange 
we analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides an important insight into the underlying health of our business 
we believe presenting results such as operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate and diluted earnings per share before non core gains and charges such as restructuring charges is appropriate because they are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations 
these non core gains and charges are identified in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
it should not be concluded from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges will not occur in the future 
non operating income or expenses and transition costs period costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary employees  relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy  all of which are reported at the corporate level  are not included in our segment results 
free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment  acquisitions  stock repurchases and additions to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors  as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments 
free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure of net cash flows provided by operating activities 
therefore  we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe these measures are useful because they reflect how we manage our business 
these adjustments to our results in accordance with gaap are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance 
these adjustments to our gaap results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods for evaluating the performance of the business  allocating resources and for compensation purposes 
however  these measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue  operating income  diluted earnings per share or net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with gaap 
we discuss our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap and provide a reconciliation of our gaap and non gaap results in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly  or at all  the presentation of these measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies

we rely primarily on our sales force of approximately  team members worldwide to sell our products  of which approximately  and are in our north america and international segments  respectively 
our sales force includes relationship managers and product specialists who sell to our higher revenue customers  teams of telesales people who sell to our lower revenue customers and a team that sells to resellers of our products and our data  such as lexis nexis

accordingly  neither the company nor any of our business segments is dependent on a single customer or a few customers  such that a loss of any one would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated annual results or the annual results of any of our business segments 
competition we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
a number of competitors are active in specific aspects of our business 
however  we believe no competitor offers our complete line of solutions or can match our global data quality resulting from our dunsright tm quality process 
in north america  we are a market leader in our risk management solutions business in terms of relative market share and revenue of third party business credit information 
we directly compete with a broad range of companies  including consumer credit companies such as equifax  inc and experian information solutions  inc  which have traditionally primarily offered consumer information services  but now offer products that combine consumer information with business information as a tool to help customers make credit decisions with respect to small businesses 
we also compete with our customers own internal business practices 
we also compete in north america with a broad range of companies offering products similar to our sales marketing solutions and supply management solutions as well as our customers own purchasing departments 
in our sales marketing solutions business  our direct competitors include companies such as experian information solutions  inc  and infousa  inc 
i usa 
in our supply management solutions business  we directly compete with specialty consulting firms  specialty data providers  specialty software companies  as well as large consulting firms 
in our e business solutions  hoover s competition varies based on the size of customer and the level of spending available for services such as hoover s online 
on the high end of product pricing  hoover s pro and hoover s pro plus and hoover s pro premium compete with other business information providers such as onesource recently acquired by i usa 
on the lower end of product pricing  hoover s lite mainly competes with free advertising supported sites and other free or low priced information sources  such as yahoo finance and cbs marketwatch 
outside north america  the competitive environment varies by country 
in some countries  leadership positions exist  while other markets are more competitive 
for example  in europe  our direct competition is primarily local  such as cerved in italy and experian in the uk 
in addition  common links exist among some of these competitors through their membership in two european information network alliances  bignet experian and eurogate coface scrl graydon  and we believe that competitors may be pursuing the establishment of their own pan european network through direct investment  which could ultimately be positioned by them as an alternative to our pan european network that we have established through the implementation of our international market leadership strategy 
however  we believe we offer superior solutions when compared to these networks because of our competitive advantage our dunsright tm quality process which we deliver on a global basis 
in addition  the european sales marketing solutions landscape is both localized and fragmented throughout europe  where numerous local players of varying size compete for business 
we also face competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and business information services  other information and professional service providers  and credit insurers 
for example  in certain international markets  such as europe  some credit insurers have identified the provision of credit information as an additional revenue stream 
in addition  business information products and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information products and services 
as discussed in our aspiration and our strategy above  we believe that our winning culture  our brand  and our flexible business model form a powerful  competitive advantage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based on a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our proprietary dunsright tm quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  our ability to attract local customers to the worldwide information services offered by our unique database  our ability to demonstrate value through our decision making tools and integration capabilities  the reliability and quality of our information  our brand perception  our ability to continue to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy and effectively reallocate our spending to activities that drive revenue growth  our ability to deliver business information through various media and distribution channels in formats tailored to customer requirements  our ability to attract and retain a high performing workforce  our ability to enhance our existing services or introduce new services  and our ability to improve our international business model and data quality through the successful management of strategic relationships in our international segment

item properties our executive offices are located at jfk parkway  short hills  new jersey  in a  square foot property that we lease 
this property also serves as the executive offices of our north america segment 
our other properties are geographically distributed to meet sales and operating requirements worldwide 
we generally consider these properties to be both suitable and adequate to meet current operating requirements  and most of the space is being utilized 
the most important of these other properties include the following sites a  square foot leased space in bethlehem  pennsylvania  which houses various sales  finance and data acquisition personnel approximately one third of this space is subleased to a third party  a  square foot office building that we own in parsippany  new jersey  housing personnel from our us sales  marketing and technology groups  a  square foot office building that is leased in austin  texas  which houses a majority of hoover s employees  and  square feet of leased space in high wycombe  england  which houses operational and technology services for europe and serves as the executive offices for our european operations 
in addition to the above locations  we also conduct operations from other offices located throughout the us  of which are leased  and us office locations  of which are leased 
item legal proceedings we are involved in tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available 
for those matters where it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated  we have recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements 
in other instances  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of any liability because of the uncertainties related to the probability of the outcome and or amount or range of loss 
as additional information becomes available  we adjust our assessment and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 
it is possible that the ultimate resolution of our liabilities and contingencies could be at amounts that are different from our currently recorded reserves and that such differences could be material 
based on our review of the latest information available  we believe our ultimate liability in connection with pending tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position  with the possible exception of the matters described below 
in order to understand our exposure to the potential liabilities described below  it is important to understand the relationship between us and moody s corporation  our predecessors and other parties that  through various corporate reorganizations and contractual commitments  have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters 
in november  the company then known as the dun bradstreet corporation d b separated through a spin off into three separate public companies d b  acnielsen corporation acnielsen and cognizant corporation cognizant the distribution 
this was accomplished through a spin off by d b of its stock in acnielsen and cognizant 
in june  d b separated through a spin off into two separate public companies d b  which changed its name to rh donnelley corporation donnelley d b  spun off its stock in a new company named the dun bradstreet corporation d b the distribution 
during  cognizant separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated ims and nielsen media research  inc nmr the cognizant distribution 
in september  d b separated through a spin off into two separate public companies d b  which changed its name to moody s corporation moody s and also referred to elsewhere in this form k as moody s d b  spun off its stock in a new company named the dun bradstreet corporation we or d b and also referred to elsewhere in this form k as d b the distribution 
tax matters moody s d b and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business  principally through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations 
as further described below  we have contractual obligations to be financially responsible for a portion of certain liabilities arising from three of these historical tax planning initiatives legacy tax matters 
the status of these legacy tax matters is summarized below  including our settlement of the matter referred to as utilization of capital losses capital losses matter during the fourth quarter of pursuant to a series of tax sharing agreements the tax sharing agreements  ims and nmr are jointly and severally liable for and must pay one half  and we and moody s d b are jointly and severally liable for and must pay the other half  of any payments over million for taxes  accrued interest and other amounts resulting from the legacy tax matters other than the matter summarized under amortization and royalty expense deductions royalty income  for which we and moody s d b are solely responsible 
moody s d b was contractually obligated to pay  and did pay  that million in connection with the capital losses matter 
as further described below  we currently believe that we have adequate reserves for these matters and  as a result  the ultimate resolution of these legacy tax matters is not expected to have a material impact on our earnings 
utilization of capital losses the irs completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during and and  on june   issued a formal notice of adjustment 
on may   an amended tax return was filed for the and tax periods  which reflected million of tax and interest due 
moody s d b paid the irs approximately million of this amount on may   and ims paid the irs approximately million on may  the payments were made to the irs to stop further interest from accruing 
donnelley d b  the taxpayer of record  filed a complaint for a refund in the us district court on september  during the fourth quarter of  the taxpayer entered into a settlement agreement with the irs resolving this matter 
we expect the net impact of the settlement to our cash flow in will be approximately million tax  interest  and penalties  net of tax benefits and inclusive of amounts in dispute with ims and nmr as described below  in line with our expectations 
this amount will be payable to the irs following our receipt of the related bills for the settlement 
the irs has issued to the taxpayer of record a bill with respect to tax year for million which was paid in full by february  by the companies noted above 
of this amount  we paid million 
we expect the irs to issue the bill or bills for the balance of the settlement during the first half of  based on representations from the irs 
as stated above  the tax sharing agreements provide that ims and nmr are jointly and severally liable and must pay one half  and we and moody s d b are jointly and severally liable and must pay the other half  of tax liabilities relating to this matter 
ims and nmr have indicated to us their belief that they are not responsible for certain portions of the remaining settlement payment 
given our indemnification obligations to donnelley d b the taxpayer of record we and moody s d b are required to pay to the irs on behalf of donnelley d b any portion of the settlement amount not paid by ims and nmr 
based on our discussions with ims and nmr  we believe that this dispute with ims and nmr will require that we pay the irs approximately million tax and interest  net of tax benefits in excess of our allocable share of the settlement under the terms of the tax sharing agreements 
we believe that the position of ims and nmr on this issue is contrary to their obligations under the tax sharing agreements 
if we are unable to resolve this dispute with ims and nmr through the negotiation process contemplated by the tax sharing agreements we will commence arbitration proceedings to enforce our rights to collect these amounts from ims and nmr 
while we believe we will prevail in any such arbitration  we cannot predict with certainty that we will ultimately achieve this result 
royalty expense deductions in the second quarter of  we received on behalf of donnelley d b a proposed notice of deficiency from the irs proposing adjustments with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in specifically  the irs proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by donnelley d bl on its tax returns 
we estimate that the disallowance of the and royalty expense deductions would result in a loss to us of up to million in pending tax refunds 
we also estimate that the net impact to d b s cash flow with respect to the disallowance of the and royalty expense deductions could be up to million tax  interest and penalties  net of tax benefits 
in addition  and also in the second quarter of  we received on behalf of the partnership associated with the above transaction a notice of proposed adjustment from the irs challenging the tax treatment of certain royalty payments received by the partnership in which donnelley d b was a partner 
in that notice  the irs is seeking to reallocate certain partnership income to donnelley d b in january  we received  on behalf of the partnership  a notice of proposed partnership adjustment  and on behalf of donnelley d b a notice of proposed adjustment similar to those received in the second quarter of associated with donnelley d bl s remaining interest in the partnership transaction as described above for the three months in for which the entities were partners 
in april  we received  on behalf of donnelley d b  a proposed notice of deficiency proposing the adjustments described in the january notice 
we estimate that the net impact to cash flow with respect to our share of this income for the notices received in and could be up to million tax  interest  and penalties  net of tax benefits 
we believe that the position of the irs regarding the partnership is inconsistent with its position with respect to the same royalty expense deductions described above and  therefore  the irs is unlikely to prevail on both positions 
the million referenced in this paragraph would be in addition to the million noted above related to royalty expense deductions discussed in the previous paragraph 
we previously reported in our form q for the quarter ended june   that we had negotiated with the irs a tentative settlement of this matter for tax years the proposed settlement 
per the terms of the proposed settlement  the taxpayer would retain approximately of the tax benefit associated with this transaction and pay a penalty of approximately 
during the third quarter of  the irs tendered to us a final settlement agreement for this matter  reflecting the financial terms set forth in the related proposed settlement 
in accordance with the tax sharing agreements we sought consent to execute the final settlement agreement for this matter from the relevant parties having financial responsibilities under the tax sharing agreements ie  donnelley d b  moody s d b  ims  nmr and d b 
only nmr and ims did not consent to the final settlement agreement as tendered by the irs 
as a result  the settlement agreement was not executed and the irs withdrew its settlement offer 
the tax sharing agreements  which govern each of the parties rights and obligations under this situation  provide that  a party withholding consent to a proposed settlement shall continue or initiate further proceedings with the irs at its own expense  and the liability of 
the party previously in control of such proceedings 
shall be limited to the liability that would have resulted from the proposed settlement agreement including interest  additions to tax and penalties which have accrued at that time 
we believe  therefore  as a result of the failure of nmr and ims to provide their consent that in accordance with the foregoing provisions the royalty expense indemnity defense provisions we have effectively capped our liability for this matter with respect to tax years at the amounts provided in the royalty expense proposed settlement and related final agreement 
thus  we believe that the ultimate resolution of the tax years will have a projected net impact to our cash flow of million tax  interest and penalties  net of tax benefits 
we also believe that in accordance with the terms of the tax sharing agreements nmr would be contractually responsible to pay any excess amounts above the proposed settlement that may ultimately be owing with respect to tax years ims has alleged various breaches of our obligations under the tax sharing agreements related to our management and attempted settlement of this matter 
in addition to reserving its rights against d b  ims has urged nmr to challenge our application of the royalty expense indemnity defense provisions of the tax sharing agreements namely  that nmr must now lead the defense and that nmr and ims indemnify us for any financial outcome that is less advantageous to us than the final settlement  and assert breaches of contract and to terminate the obligations of ims and nmr under the tax sharing agreements generally 
we believe that neither nmr nor ims have any right or the legal basis to terminate their obligations under the tax sharing agreements and that any attempt to do so will be found to be without merit 
we anticipate commencing arbitration proceedings to enforce our rights under the royalty expense indemnity defense provisions should the negotiation process required by the tax sharing agreements fail to resolve the parties dispute 
while we believe that we should prevail in such arbitration  and thereby effectively cap our exposure with respect to tax years at the levels described above  we cannot predict with certainty that we will ultimately achieve that outcome 
as noted above  the irs has withdrawn its settlement offer with respect to tax years and  accordingly  may issue notices preliminary to making assessments at any time 
if we  on behalf of donnelley d b and moody s d b  were to challenge at any time  any of the irs positions for years other than and described above in us district court or the us court of federal claims  rather than in us tax court  the disputed amounts for each applicable year would need to be paid in advance for the court to have jurisdiction over the case 
it is possible that the irs may seek to issue such notices with respect to each of the inconsistent positions noted above 
amortization and royalty expense deductions royalty income in the fourth quarter of  we received on behalf of donnelley d b and moody s d b  irs notices of proposed adjustment with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in in addition  we received  on behalf of the partnership  various irs materials further explaining the examining agent s position with respect to the activities of the partnership in in april  we received on behalf of donnelley d b and moody s d b proposed notices of deficiency from the irs  proposing adjustments with respect to the partnership transaction 
the adjustments proposed in the notices reflect the notices of proposed adjustment and other irs materials referred to above 
specifically  the irs asserted that certain amortization expense deductions claimed by donnelley d bl and moody s d b on their tax returns should be disallowed 
we estimate that the net impact to cash flow as a result of the disallowance of the and amortization deductions and the disallowance of such deductions claimed from to date could be up to million tax  interest and penalties  net of tax benefits but not taking into account the moody s d b repayment to us of million described below 
this transaction is scheduled to expire in and  unless terminated by us  the net impact to cash flow  based on current interest rates and tax rates would increase at a rate of approximately million per quarter including potential penalties as future amortization expenses are deducted 
at the distribution date  we paid moody s d b approximately million in cash representing the discounted value of future tax benefits associated with this transaction 
however  pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement for the distribution  should the transaction be terminated  moody s d b would be required to repay us an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits 
if the transaction was terminated at december   the amount of such repayment from moody s d b to us would be approximately million and would decrease by approximately million to million per year 
in addition  the irs has asserted that royalty expense deductions  claimed by donnelley d b and moody s d b on their tax returns for  for royalties paid to the partnership  should be disallowed 
relatedly  the irs has asserted that the receipt of these same royalties by the partnership should be reallocated to and reported as royalty income by donnelley d bl and moody s d b  including the portions of the royalties that were allocated to third party partners in the partnership  and  thus  included in their taxable income 
we believe that the irs stated positions with respect to the treatment of the royalty expense and royalty income are mutually inconsistent 
if the irs prevails on one of the positions with respect to the royalty expense and royalty income  we believe that it is unlikely that it will prevail on the other position 
as a result  we believe that after taking into account certain other tax benefits resulting from the irs position on the partnership it is unlikely that there will be any net impact to cash flow in addition to the amounts noted above related to the amortization expense deduction 
in the unlikely event the irs were to prevail on both positions with respect to the royalty expense income  we estimate that the net impact to cash flow as a result of the disallowance of the royalty expense deductions  the disallowance of such deductions claimed from to date and the inclusion of the reallocated royalty income for all relevant years could be up to million tax  interest  and penalties  net of tax benefits 
this million would be in addition to the million noted above related to the amortization expense deduction 
we have filed protests relating to this matter with the irs office of appeals 
during the third quarter of  we were informed by the irs office of appeals that this matter was being returned to the examination division of the irs for further development of the issues 
we are attempting to resolve this matter with the irs before proceeding to litigation  if necessary 
if we  on behalf of donnelley d b and moody s d b  were to challenge  at any time  any of these irs positions for years and in us district court or the us court of federal claims  rather than in us tax court  the disputed amounts for each applicable year would need to be paid in advance for the court to have jurisdiction over the case 
it is possible that the irs may seek to issue such notices with respect to each of the inconsistent positions noted above 
we have considered the foregoing legacy tax matters and the merits of the legal defenses and the various contractual obligations in our overall assessment of potential tax liabilities 
we have net million recorded in the consolidated financial statements  made up of the following components million of reserves in accrued income tax and million in other non current liabilities 
we believe that these reserves are adequate for our share of the liabilities in these legacy tax matters 
any payments that would be made for these exposures could be significant to our cash from operations in the period a cash payment took place  including any payments for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction in us district court or the us court of federal claims to challenge any of the irs s positions 
legal proceedings information resources  inc introduction the following is a description of an antitrust lawsuit filed in by information resources  inc iri 
as more fully described below  vnu nv  a publicly traded dutch company vnu  and its nv subsidiaries vnu  inc  acnielsen  ac nielsen us  inc 
acn us  and nielsen media research nmr collectively  the vnu parties  have assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit 
as a result of the indemnity obligation  d b does not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the vnu parties default on their obligations 
in the event of such default  contractual commitments undertaken by d b in connection with various corporate reorganizations since  including our spin off from moody s d b in  require us to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the vnu parties 
see below d b s potential exposure in the lawsuit 
moreover  as described below  on february   the us district court for the southern district of new york entered a final judgment against iri dismissing iri s claims 
iri filed a notice of appeal to the second circuit court of appeals on february  the court of appeals for the second circuit has ordered that the appeal be argued no earlier than the week of june  for a description of the terms donnelly d b  moody s d b and moody s and the relationship between donnelly d b  moody s  moody s d b and d b  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
overview of the lawsuit in july  iri filed a complaint  subsequently amended in  in the us district court for the southern district of new york  naming as defendants a company then known as the dun bradstreet corporation and now known as rh donnelley referred to in this form k as donnelley d b  ac nielsen company a subsidiary of acnielsen and ims international  inc a subsidiary of the company then known as cognizant corporation 
at the time of the filing of the complaint  each of the other defendants was a wholly owned subsidiary of donnelley d b the amended complaint alleges various violations of united states antitrust laws under sections and of the sherman antitrust act 
iri s antitrust claims allege that defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine iri s ability to compete within the united states and foreign markets in north america  latin america  asia  europe and australia new zealand through a series of anti competitive practices  including unlawfully tying bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which acnielsen competed with iri  entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny iri s access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data  predatory pricing  acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding iri s efforts to expand  disparaging iri to financial analysts and clients  and denying iri access to capital necessary for it to compete 
iri is seeking damages in excess of million  which iri also asked to be trebled 
iri has filed with the court the report of its expert who has opined that iri suffered damages of between million and million from the defendants alleged practices 
iri also sought punitive damages in an unspecified amount  which the company believes are precluded as a result of the dismissal of one of iri s claims 
on december   the court entered in limine order no 
 which bars iri from arguing that nielsen s pricing practices or discounts were illegal or anti competitive unless it can prove they involved prices below short run average variable cost  calculated without the inclusion of nielsen s fixed operations costs 
on december   iri issued a press release  which said  in relevant part  without this evidence  iri believes that little would be left of iri s case to take to trial 
iri has asked the court to enter a final judgment against it so that it can take an immediate appeal to the second circuit 
defendants did not object to this request 
on february   the court entered a final judgment dismissing iri s claims and on february   the court entered iri s notice of appeal to the court of appeals for the second circuit 
the court of appeals for the second circuit has ordered that the appeal be argued no earlier than the week of june  the indemnity and joint defense agreement in connection with the distribution  cognizant now nmr  acnielsen and donnelley d b entered into an indemnity and joint defense agreement the original jda  pursuant to which they agreed to allocate potential liabilities that may relate to  arise out of or result from the iri lawsuit iri liabilities  and conduct a joint defense of such action 
vnu s and d b s involvement in the lawsuit in  acnielsen was acquired by vnu 
vnu assumed acnielsen s obligations under the original jda 
under the terms of the distribution  d b assumed all potential liabilities of donnelley d b arising from the iri action and agreed to indemnify donnelly d b in connection with such potential liabilities 
under the terms of the distribution  d b undertook to be jointly and severally liable with moody s d b for d b s obligations to donnelley d b under the distribution  including for any liabilities arising under the original jda and arising from the iri action itself 
however  as between us and moody s d b  we agreed that under the distribution  each of us and moody s d b will be responsible for of any payments required to be made by moody s d b with respect to the iri action under the terms of the distribution  including legal fees or expenses related to the iri action 
the amended and restated jda on july   the vnu parties  donnelley d b  d b  moody s d b and ims entered into an amended and restated indemnity and joint defense agreement the amended jda 
pursuant to the amended jda  any and all iri liabilities incurred by donnelley d b  d b  moody s d b or ims relating to a judgment even if not final or any settlement being entered into in the iri action will be jointly and severally assumed and fully discharged exclusively by the vnu parties 
under the amended jda  the vnu parties have agreed to  jointly and severally  indemnify donnelley d b  d b  moody s d b and ims from and against all iri liabilities to which they become subject 
as a result  the cap on acnielsen s liability for the iri liabilities  which the original jda provided for  no longer exists and all such liabilities are the responsibility of the vnu parties pursuant to the amended jda 
in addition  the amended jda provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment  then the vnu parties shall obtain the bond required for the appeal and shall pay the full cost of such bond 
in connection with entering into the amended jda  donnelley d b  d b  moody s d b and ims agreed to amend certain covenants of the original jda to provide operational flexibility for acnielsen going forward 
in addition  the amended jda includes certain amendments to the covenants of acnielsen which  under the amended jda  are now also applicable to acn us  which we understand holds acnielsen s operating assets  which are designed to preserve such parties claim paying ability and protect donnelley d b  d b  moody s d b and ims 
among other covenants  acnielsen and acn us agreed that neither they nor any of their respective subsidiaries will incur any indebtedness to any affiliated person  except indebtedness which its payment will  after a payment obligation under the amended jda comes due  be conditioned on  and subordinated to  the payment and performance of the obligations of such parties under the amended jda 
vnu has agreed to have a process agent in new york receive on its behalf service of any process concerning the amended jda 
d b s potential exposure in the lawsuit as described above  the vnu parties have assumed exclusive responsibility for the payment of all iri liabilities 
however  because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because the rights and obligations relating to the amended jda are based on contractual relationships  the failure of the vnu parties to fulfill their obligations under the amended jda could result in the other parties bearing all or a share of the iri liabilities 
joint and several liability for the iri action means that even where more than one defendant is determined to have been responsible for an alleged wrongdoing  the plaintiff can collect all or part of the judgment from just one of the defendants 
this is true regardless of whatever contractual allocation of responsibility the defendants and any other indemnifying parties may have made  including the allocations described above between the vnu parties  donnelly d b  d b  moody s d b and ims 
accordingly  and as a result of the allocations of liability described above  in the event the vnu parties default on their obligations under the amended jda  each of moody s d b and d b will be responsible for the payment of of the portion of any judgment or settlement ultimately paid by donnelley d b which is a defendant in the iri action  which can be as high as all the iri liabilities 
while  as described above  the iri lawsuit has been dismissed  iri has filed an appeal 
accordingly  we are unable to predict the outcome of the iri action including the appeal or the financial condition of any of the vnu parties or the other defendants at the time of any such outcome and hence we cannot estimate their ability to pay the iri liabilities pursuant to the amended jda or the judgment or settlement in the iri action 
however  provided that the vnu parties fulfill their obligations under the amended jda  we believe that the resolution of this matter would not materially affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
accordingly  no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
if  however  iri were to prevail in whole or in part in this action and if d b is required to pay  notwithstanding such contractual obligations  a portion of any significant settlement or judgment  the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on d b s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
hoover s initial public offering litigation on november   a putative shareholder class action lawsuit was filed against hoover s  certain of its then current and former officers and directors the individual defendants  and one of the investment banks that was an underwriter of hoover s july initial public offering ipo 
the lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york and purports to be a class action filed on behalf of purchasers of the stock of hoover s during the period from july  through december  a consolidated amended complaint  which is now the operative complaint  was filed on april  the purported class action alleges violations of sections and of the securities act of  as amended  the act and sections b  rule b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  against hoover s and individual defendants 
plaintiffs allege that the underwriter defendant agreed to allocate stock in hoover s ipo to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional purchases of stock in the aftermarket at predetermined prices above the ipo price 
plaintiffs allege that the prospectus for hoover s ipo was false and misleading in violation of the securities laws because it did not disclose these arrangements 
the action seeks damages in an unspecified amount 
the defense of the action is being coordinated with more than other nearly identical actions filed against other companies 
on july   hoover s moved to dismiss all claims against it and the individual defendants 
on october   the court dismissed the individual defendants from the case based upon stipulations of dismissal filed by the plaintiffs and the individual defendants 
on february   the court denied the motion to dismiss the complaint against hoover s 
on october   the court certified a class in six of the approximately other nearly identical actions and noted that the decision is intended to provide strong guidance to all parties regarding class certification in the remaining cases 
plaintiffs have not yet moved to certify a class in the case involving hoover s 
hoover s has approved a settlement agreement and related agreements that set forth the terms of a settlement between hoover s  the plaintiff class and the vast majority of the other approximately issuer defendants 
among other provisions  the settlement provides for a release of hoover s and the individual defendants for the conduct alleged in the action to be wrongful 
hoover s would agree to undertake certain responsibilities  including agreeing to assign away  not assert  or release certain potential claims hoover s may have against its underwriters 
the settlement agreement also provides a guaranteed recovery of billion to plaintiffs for the cases relating to all of the approximately issuers 
to the extent that the underwriter defendants settle all of the cases for at least billion  no payment will be required under the issuers settlement agreement 
to the extent that the underwriter defendants settle for less than billion  the issuers are required to make up the difference 
it is anticipated that any potential financial obligation of hoover s to plaintiffs pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement and related agreements will be covered by existing insurance 
hoover s currently is not aware of any material limitations on the expected recovery of any potential financial obligation to plaintiffs from its insurance carriers 
its carriers are solvent  and hoover s is not aware of any uncertainties as to the legal sufficiency of an insurance claim with respect to any recovery by plaintiffs 
therefore  we do not expect that the settlement will involve any payment by hoover s 
if material limitations on the expected recovery of any potential financial obligation to the plaintiffs from hoover s insurance carriers should arise  hoover s maximum financial obligation to plaintiffs pursuant to the settlement agreement is less than million 
on february   the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement  subject to certain modifications consistent with its opinion 
the court ruled that the issuer defendants and the plaintiffs must submit a revised settlement agreement that provides for a mutual bar of all contribution claims by the settling and non settling parties and does not bar the parties from pursuing other claims 
there is a conference scheduled with the judge on march  to discuss the status of the revised settlement agreement 
the underwriter defendants will have an opportunity to object to the revised settlement agreement 
there is no assurance that the parties to the settlement will be able to agree to a revised settlement agreement consistent with the court s opinion  or that the court will grant final approval to the settlement to the extent the parties reach agreement 
as previously noted  if the settlement is ultimately approved and implemented in its current form  hoover s reasonably foreseeable exposure in this matter  if any  would be limited to amounts that would be covered by existing insurance 
if the settlement is not approved in its current form  we cannot predict the final outcome of this matter or whether such outcome or ultimate resolution of this matter could materially affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
no amount in respect of any potential judgment in this matter has been accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
pension plan litigation in march  a lawsuit seeking class action status was filed against us in federal court in connecticut on behalf of specified former employees relating to our retirement plans 
as noted below  during the fourth quarter of most of the counts in the complaint were dismissed 
the complaint  as amended in july the amended complaint  sets forth the following putative class current d b employees who are participants in the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account and were previously participants in its predecessor plan  the dun bradstreet master retirement plan  current employees of receivable management services corporation rmsc who are participants in the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account and were previously participants in its predecessor plan  the dun bradstreet master retirement plan  former employees of d b or d b s receivable management services rms operations who received a deferred vested retirement benefit under either the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account or the dun bradstreet master retirement plan  and former employees of d b s rms operations whose employment with d b terminated after the sale of the rms operations but who are not employees of rmsc and who  during their employment with d b  were eligible employees for purposes of the dun bradstreet career transition plan 
the amended complaint estimates that the proposed class covers over  individuals 
there are four counts in the amended complaint 
count claims that we violated erisa by not paying severance benefits to plaintiffs under our career transition plan 
count claims a violation of erisa in that our sale of the rms business to rmsc and the resulting termination of our employees constituted a prohibited discharge of the plaintiffs and or discrimination against the plaintiffs for the intentional purpose of interfering with their employment and or attainment of employee benefit rights which they might otherwise have attained 
count claims that the plaintiffs were materially harmed by our alleged violation of erisa s requirements that a summary plan description reasonably apprise participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plans and that  therefore  undisclosed plan provisions in this case  the actuarial deduction beneficiaries incur when they leave d b before age and elect to retire early cannot be enforced against them 
count claims that the interest rate the rate is actually used to actuarially reduce early retirement benefits is unreasonable and  therefore  results in a prohibited forfeiture of benefits under erisa 
in the amended complaint  the plaintiffs sought payment of severance benefits  equitable relief in the form of either reinstatement of employment with d b or restoration of employee benefits including stock options  invalidation of the actuarial reductions applied to deferred vested early retirement benefits  including invalidation of the plan rate of the actual rate is used to actuarially reduce former employees early retirement benefits  attorneys fees and such other relief as the court may deem just 
we deny all allegations of wrongdoing and are aggressively defending the case 
in september  we filed a motion to dismiss counts  and of the amended complaint on the ground that plaintiffs cannot prevail on those claims under any set of facts  and in february  the court heard oral argument on our motion 
with respect to count  the court requested that the parties conduct limited expert discovery and submit further briefing 
in november  after completion of expert discovery on count  we moved for summary judgment on count on the ground that an interest rate of is reasonable as a matter of law 
briefing on that motion is being completed 
meanwhile  on november  the court issued a ruling granting our motion to dismiss counts and shortly after that ruling  plaintiffs counsel stipulated to dismiss count which challenged the sale of the rms business as an intentional interference with employee benefit rights  but which the motion to dismiss did not address 
plaintiffs counsel also stipulated to a dismissal of count  the severance pay claim  agreeing to forego any appeal of the court s dismissal of that claim 
plaintiffs counsel did file a motion to join party plaintiffs and to amend the amended complaint to add a new count challenging the adequacy of the retirement plan s mortality tables 
the court granted the motion and we have filed our objections 
we are unable to predict at this time the final outcome of this matter or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in our consolidated financial statements

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations how we manage our business through december   we reported our business on a geographical basis with two segments north america which consists of operations in the united states and canada contributed   and of our total revenue in   and  respectively  and contributed   and of our core revenue in   and  respectively  and international which consists of operations in europe  asia pacific  and latin america contributed   and of our total revenue in   and  respectively  and contributed   and of our core revenue in   and  respectively 
on january   we began managing our operations in canada as part of our international segment 
results by segment are discussed herein under the reporting structure in place during we will report financial results in the new segment structure beginning with the first quarter of and conform historical amounts to reflect the new segment structure 
the following customer solution sets are sold in our segments risk management solutions our largest customer solution set  contributed   and of our total revenue in   and  respectively  and contributed   and of our core revenue in   and  respectively  sales marketing solutions our second largest customer solution set  contributed   and of our total revenue in   and  respectively  and contributed   and of our core revenue in   and  respectively  supply management solutions contributed   and of our total revenue in  and  respectively  and contributed of our core revenue in each of   and  and e business solutions which represents the results of our hoover s business acquired in march  contributed and of our total revenue in and  respectively and contributed and of our core revenue in and  respectively 
these customer solution sets are discussed in greater detail in item business 
the divested businesses contributed   and of our total revenue in   and  respectively 
within our risk management solutions and sales marketing solutions  we monitor the performance of our older  more traditional products and our newer value added products 
our traditional risk management solutions generally consist of reports derived from our database which our customers use primarily to make decisions about new credit applications 
our traditional risk management solutions constituted in   and  respectively   and of our risk management solutions revenue    and of our total revenue  and   and of our core revenue 
our value added risk management solutions generally support automated decision making and portfolio management through the use of scoring and integrated software solutions 
our value added risk management solutions constituted in   and  respectively   and of our risk management solutions revenue  of our total revenue  and of our core revenue 
our traditional sales marketing solutions generally consist of marketing lists  labels and customized data files used by our customers in their direct mail and direct marketing activities 
our traditional sales marketing solutions constituted in   and  respectively   and of our sales marketing solutions revenue    and of our total revenue  and   and of our core revenue 
our value added sales marketing solutions generally include decision making and customer information management products 
our value added sales marketing solutions constituted in   and  respectively   and of our sales marketing solutions revenue    and of our total revenue  and   and of our core revenue 
for internal management purposes  we use total revenue excluding the revenue of divested businesses  which we refer to as core revenue  to manage and evaluate the performance of our business segments and to allocate resources  because this measure provides an indication of the underlying direction of changes in revenue in a single performance measure without reported revenue of divested businesses which will not be included in future revenue 
divested business revenue for the three years of results included in this form k includes the revenue from our operations in korea sold in the fourth quarter of  israel sold in the third quarter of  the nordic region sweden  denmark  norway and finland  all sold in the first quarter of  india and other distribution channels in pakistan and the middle east sold in the first quarter of  central europe germany  austria  switzerland  poland  hungary and the czech republic  all sold in the second quarter of  iberia spain and portugal  both sold in the fourth quarter of  and france sold in the fourth quarter of 
these divested businesses have been classified as other divested businesses in note to our consolidated financial statements 
management believes that this measure provides valuable insight into our revenue from ongoing operations and enables investors to evaluate business performance and trends by facilitating a comparison of results of ongoing operations with past reports of financial results 
we also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because  while we take steps to manage our exposure to foreign currency  we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another  both with and without the effects of foreign exchange 
as a result  we monitor our core revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange 
core revenue growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange is referred to as revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange 
we also separately analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components  organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions 
we analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides an important insight into the underlying health of our business 
core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition 
we evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange  and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance 
specifically  for management reporting purposes  we evaluate business segment performance before non core gains and charges such as restructuring charges because they are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations 
additionally  transition costs period costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary employees  relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy are reported as all other expenses and are not allocated to our business segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding our segments 
similarly  when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole  we focus on results such as operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate and diluted earnings per share before non core gains and charges because they are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations 
it should not be concluded from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges will not occur in the future 
another component of how we manage our business is free cash flow 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software other intangibles 
free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment  acquisitions  stock repurchases and additions to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments 
free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure of net cash flows provided by operating activities 
therefore  we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 
the adjustments to our generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap results discussed herein are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods  to allocate resources  to evaluate business performance and for compensation purposes 
however  these financial measures results before non core gains and charges and free cash flow are not prepared in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue  operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate  diluted earnings per share  or net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly or at all  the presentation of these financial measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies 
see results of operations  below  for a discussion of our results reported on a gaap basis 
our flexible business model and restructuring as part of our blueprint for growth strategy  we continually seek opportunities to reallocate our spending to activities that drive revenue growth while  at the same time  improving our profitability during our transformation 
this is a structured process we call creating financial flexibility 
since october  we have implemented a series of financial flexibility programs 
our financial flexibility process is discussed in more detail under item business our aspiration and our strategy create financial flexibility 
with each program  we have incurred a restructuring charge  which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations 
these charges are incurred as a result of eliminating  consolidating  standardizing  automating and or outsourcing operations of our business 
we have also incurred transition costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary workers  relocation costs and stay bonuses to implement our financial flexibility programs 
we believe the success of our flexible business model is illustrated by a comparison of our financial results from the year the blueprint for growth strategy was launched through over the five year period  we incurred restructuring charges totaling million and transition costs totaling million  averaging in total approximately million per year 
even after incurring these charges and the loss of operating income associated with the sales of businesses  our operating income increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
see results of operations  below  for a more complete discussion of our financial results  including these restructuring charges 
in addition  the financial flexibility program provided us with the funds to invest in our core business and make selective acquisitions 
this allowed us to significantly increase our organic and core revenue over this period  with the result that our total revenue declined only slightly from  million in to  million in notwithstanding the loss of revenue associated with the sale of non core businesses and the divestiture of businesses in furtherance of our international market leadership strategy 
our critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances reflected therein  we have applied the significant accounting policies described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
of those policies  we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require management s subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the actual results become known and could have a material impact on such period 
we have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations we offer substantially all of our us based employees coverage in a defined benefit plan called the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account the us qualified plan 
the defined benefit plan covers active and retired employees including retired individuals from spin off companies see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of spin off companies 
pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the internal revenue code 
we also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the united states the us non qualified plans to provide additional retirement benefits to certain key employees 
these plans are unfunded  pay as you go plans 
the us qualified plan and the us non qualified plans account for approximately and of our pension obligation  respectively  at december  our employees in certain of our international operations are also provided retirement benefits through defined benefit plans  representing the remaining balance of our pension obligations 
in addition to providing pension benefits  we provide various health care and life insurance benefits for retirees 
us based employees who retire after age with years of vesting service are eligible to receive benefits 
postretirement benefit costs and obligations are determined actuarially 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  our pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
other postretirement benefits ie  health care are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and are also dependent on the application of our assumptions by our outside actuaries 
the key assumptions we have made for our us plans  which we evaluate annually  include expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on current and expected asset allocations as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments 
discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations 
it is based on investment yields available at year end on aa rated corporate long term bonds and the citigroup pension curve 
rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators 
health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  though changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
the factor with the most immediate impact on our financial statements is a change in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets for the us qualified plan 
for  we will lower this assumption to from the assumption we used to calculate pension income in and the assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the us qualified plan  after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plan s asset allocation 
as of december   the plan was invested in publicly traded equity securities  invested in debt securities and invested in real estate investments 
we expect this one quarter percentage point decrease in the long term rate of return will reduce our annual operating income by approximately million by reducing our net periodic pension income 
changes in the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income 
these rates are adjusted yearly  based on the factors noted above 
for example  as of december   for all of our us pension plans  we lowered the discount rate to from used at december  we expect that this one quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate applied with respect to the us qualified and non qualified plans will reduce our annual operating income by approximately million by reducing our net periodic pension income 
as of december   we also lowered the discount rate for our postretirement benefit plan to from used at december  we do not expect this three quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate will have a significant impact on our annual operating income 
differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
these gains and losses are aggregated and amortized over the average future service periods of employees to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor as defined in sfas no 
the purpose of the corridor is to average the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above  on a plan by plan basis 
for all of our pension plans  total unrecognized actuarial losses as of december  were million  of which million was attributable to the us qualified plan  million was attributable to the us non qualified plans  and the remainder was attributable to the non us pension plans 
we expect to recognize such losses in our net periodic pension cost of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for the us qualified plan  us non qualified plans and non us plans  compared to million  million and million  respectively  in the increased actuarial loss related to the us qualified plan of million  which will be included in our pension income in  is primarily due to unrecognized actuarial losses exceeding the corridor threshold under sfas no 
at january   while the balance at january  was within the corridor threshold 
differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost 
we recorded net periodic income for our pension plans of million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
this income was driven principally by the expected return on plan assets  which was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost 
in and  we recorded investment gains of million and million  respectively  in our pension plans  of which million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us qualified plan 
at january   the market related value of our us qualified plan was  million  which excludes million of unrecognized investment losses from prior periods that will reduce the market related value in future years 
if these unrecognized losses are not recovered in future years  our market related value of assets will decrease  causing our expected return on plan assets and our net periodic pension income to fall 
changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in a significant future charge to our equity 
under the requirements of sfas no 
 if the plan asset value falls below the related accumulated benefit obligation  we would be required to record a minimum pension liability for the different amount and reverse our prepaid pension cost 
this charge would be recorded against a component of shareholders equity net of applicable deferred taxes 
we recognized charges of million  million and million  net of applicable taxes  to equity for minimum pension liabilities related to our us non qualified plans and us plans for  and  respectively 
the us qualified plan  our principal plan  is currently over funded 
the excess of the fair value of plan assets over the related accumulated benefit obligation was million at december   compared with million at december  the prepaid pension cost associated with this plan was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
a change in the discount rate assumption could result in a change in the funded status of our pension plans by changing the amount of the accumulated benefit obligation 
for the us qualified plan  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our accumulated benefit obligation by approximately million 
for the non qualified plans  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our accumulated benefit obligation by approximately million 
for information on pension and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements  please see future liquidity sources and uses of funds pension plan and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements in the contractual cash obligations table 
also see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs of  and assumptions for  our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs 
contingencies and litigation we establish reserves in connection with tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments concerning potential actions by third parties and regulators 
this is an inherently subjective and complex process  and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts

there were two main drivers of the growth 
the first was our self awareness solutions  which allows our small business customers to establish  improve and protect their own credit 
the second driver was the subscription plan we introduced in the united states in the fourth quarter of for customers that are willing to purchase more data from d b 
this new plan provides expanded access to our risk management solutions in a way that provides more certainty over related costs and generally results in customers increasing their spending on our products 
these drivers benefited both our traditional and our value added risk management solutions 
our traditional risk management solutions grew by increase before the effect of foreign exchange  and our value added risk management solutions increased by increase before the effect of foreign exchange 
a million  or  increase in sales marketing solutions increase before the effect of foreign exchange 
this increase was primarily driven by double digit growth in north america s customer information management cim products and our migration of customers from traditional lists and labels to our more automated value added solutions in north america 
as a result of this migration and continued weakness in certain of our traditional list and labels business  traditional sales marketing solutions declined by decrease before the effect of foreign exchange 
the decline in our traditional sales marketing solutions revenue was offset by the increase increase before the effect of foreign exchange in value added sales marketing solutions 
a million  or  decline in supply management solutions  our smallest solution set decline before the effect of foreign exchange 
this decline was primarily due to product delivery and customer renewal issues 
a million  or  increase in e business solutions  representing the results of hoover s  inc the increase was primarily due to continued growth in subscription revenue  the benefit of our marketing efforts which have driven increased traffic to the hoover s web site and strong ad sales 
additionally  this increase includes twenty percentage points of growth from the purchase accounting adjustments on the results 
in addition  investments in dunsright tm quality process  our unique value proposition that powers all our customer solution sets  also benefited our core revenue results

during the year  within our risk management solutions we added product development resources  increased our sales force  and improved our post sale delivery service 
the growth in the customer solution set was driven by both our north america and international segments 
traditional risk management solutions revenue was up increase before the effect of foreign exchange compared with we continued our intentional migration of customers from the bir and related products to our value added solutions to assist them in re engineering their processes

we had net pension income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in pension income in and compared with was primarily due to the one percentage point decrease in the long term rate of return assumption used in and for our us qualified plan 
we lowered this rate from in to in and additionally  the increased actuarial loss included in pension income as required by sfas no 
contributed to the decrease in our pension income 
we expect pension expense will be approximately million in the increase in pension cost in is primarily driven by the increased actuarial loss included in pension cost as required by sfas no 
 the one quarter percentage point decrease in the long term rate of return for the us qualified plan and the one quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate applied to the us qualified and non qualified plans 
in addition  we recognized curtailment charges of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the curtailment charges were a result of our financial flexibility programs in   and and a plan amendment in related to the uk pension plan 
we had postretirement benefit income of million in and postretirement benefit costs of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in postretirement benefit income or decrease in cost in was due to the employer contribution cap that we put in place effective in january  specifically  in the fourth quarter of  we amended our postretirement benefit plan 
starting january   we began to limit the amount of our insurance premium contribution based on the amount d b contributed in per retiree 
this change is expected to reduce our annual postretirement benefit costs by approximately million a year for five to six years  starting in the adoption of the medicare reform act in the third quarter of also contributed to the decreased postretirement benefit cost 
we expect postretirement benefit income will be approximately the same in as in we recognized a million curtailment gain in related to our postretirement benefit plan as a result of our financial flexibility program 
we consider net pension income and postretirement benefit costs to be part of our compensation costs and  therefore  they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs 
see the discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates pension and postretirement benefit obligations  above  and note to our consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  in from and million  or  in from the decrease in from was largely driven by our business model changes which have enabled us to reduce the capital requirements of our business through continuous reengineering  leveraging partners in key markets and outsourcing capital intensive activities 
also contributing to the decrease was the sale of our building in high wycombe  england  in july the decrease in from was partially offset by the acquisition of the three italian real estate data companies and the impact of foreign exchange 
the decrease in from was largely driven by the sale of our facility in high wycombe  england in and the sale of our facilities in berkeley heights and murray hill  new jersey in  lower capitalized spending in  and the impact of our outsourcing of certain technology functions to computer sciences corporation csc 
the lower capitalized spending is a result of our delivering more products over the web  resulting in investment projects becoming less capital intensive

million of revenue from e business solutions 
we first began offering our hoover s solution to customers in europe in the fourth quarter of core revenue growth in international also benefited from our investments in our dunsright tm quality process  our unique value proposition that powers all our customer solution sets 
in addition  international core revenue growth benefited from our international market leadership strategy  through which we have developed partnerships with strong local players who have enhanced our dunsright tm quality process  resulting in an improved value proposition for our customers 
the following factors affecting international create particular challenges to our revenue growth in most international markets  we do not have market leadership positions 
this makes us particularly susceptible to competitive pressures 
our competition is primarily local  and our customers may have greater loyalty to our local competitors 
credit insurance is a significant credit risk mitigation tool in certain markets  thus reducing the demand for information based credit risk mitigation tools  such as those offered by us 
in many local markets  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources  thus reducing our data collection advantage 
prior to the launch of our blueprint for growth strategy  our investment decisions were made at the country level and not in a coordinated fashion 
while we have made significant investments to mitigate this situation  we are still faced with uneven data quality in some local markets 
international s operating income increased million  or  from the prior year  primarily due to the increase in core revenue  as well as reduced operating expenses as a result of divested businesses  the benefits of our reengineering initiatives  and the positive effect of foreign exchange 
in addition to the foregoing challenges to revenue growth in our international segment  recent tax legislation in italy is expected to significantly increase the costs of operating our italian real estate information business by up to approximately million in this business  which we entered into in see note acquisitions and other investments  represented approximately of international s total revenue in of million and of international s core revenue in of million 
the primary customers for our real estate information business are banks  which use real estate information in making credit decisions 
on february   regulations implementing new tax legislation became effective in italy that is expected to significantly increase the cost of conducting our italian real estate information business in specifically  the regulations increase data acquisition costs for italian real estate information and require that we pay a fee each time we resell or license that data 
our plan is to fully address these incremental costs through price increases to our customers to mitigate the impact to our operating income in italy 
accordingly  we began implementing these price increases in february at this time  we cannot predict with certainty the final impact that this tax legislation and related regulations will have on our reported results because we cannot forecast customer acceptance of the price increases  the impact that such price increases may have on customers utilization of our real estate and other products during the year  the full nature and impact of actions that we may take to mitigate the operating income impact of the legislation and the actions of our competitors 
our previously announced guidance for as furnished in our form k dated february   does not include the impact of the new italian tax legislation and related regulations 
we expect to provide an update on this matter and its impact on our business in our form l q for the quarter ended march  as we continue to implement our international market leadership strategy  we will continue to use different approaches to improve our competitive position from market to market worldwide 
in some markets  we are investing to strengthen our position  either through organic growth or by acquisition 
in other markets  we are establishing strategic relationships to strengthen our global data coverage and our customer value propositions 
additionally  we will continue to leverage our dunsright tm quality process to establish leadership positions in our international markets 
vs 
international total revenue increased million  or  in from  reflecting a million  or increase increase before the effect of foreign exchange in core revenue and a million increase in revenue from our divested businesses 
ten percentage points of core revenue growth came from our acquisitions of data house in the third quarter of and the additional italian real estate data companies in the second quarter on a customer solution set basis  the million increase in core international revenue reflects a million  or  increase in risk management solutions increase before the effect of foreign exchange  including thirteen percentage points of growth due to the acquisitions of data house and the italian real estate data companies 
traditional risk management solutions increased by increase before the effect of foreign exchange  including fourteen percentage points of growth due to the acquisitions 
within our traditional products  we experienced competitive pricing pressures on our low end products 
we also experienced a shift in our customers spending from higher priced comprehensive reports to low priced  less detailed reports 
these competitive and pricing pressures were partially offset by the continued success of our new monitoring product  e portfolio 
value added risk management solutions increased by increase before the effect of foreign exchange  driven by the customers preference to continue to automate their decisioning process through products such as global decision maker tm  and integrate existing systems using our toolkit solutions 
a million  or  increase in sales marketing solutions increase before the effect of foreign exchange 
traditional sales marketing solutions increased by decrease before the effect of foreign exchange  and our value added sales marketing solutions increased increase before the effect of foreign exchange 
the decline in our traditional sales marketing solutions was indicative of economic pressures in the eurozone  compounded by low growth forecasts in larger markets 
we also continued to see competitive pricing pressures in our traditional list and label business 
the improvement in our value added sales marketing solutions can be attributed to specific management actions that occurred in the third quarter of those actions included i the addition of sales leadership in five major markets  each with a dedicated sales team  ii the continued increased focus by our sales teams on value added products  iii expanded demand generation programs  and iv growth in linkage products resulting from our customers movement from cd to web based solutions 
a million  or  increase in supply management solutions increase before the effect of foreign exchange  primarily due to the continued growth in our data rationalization products 
international s operating income increased million  or  in from  primarily due to the positive effect of foreign exchange 
to a lesser extent  our acquisitions  our reengineering initiatives  and reduced operating expenses as a result of our divested businesses also contributed to the increase in operating income 
market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of our investments 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
we use short term foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans  investments and certain third party and intercompany transactions and  from time to time  we have used foreign exchange option contracts to reduce our international earnings exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates 
in addition  we use interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding fixed rate notes  as discussed under interest rate risk  below 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk our objective in managing exposure to interest rates is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings  cash flows and financial position  and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a policy that floating rate debt be managed within a minimum and maximum range of our total debt exposure 
to achieve our policy objectives  we may use fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and or interest rate swaps 
in  we issued million in principal of five year  fixed rate notes that mature in march see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with that note issuance  we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements in the third quarter of with notional principal amounts totaling million see note to our consolidated financial statements  and designated these swaps as fair value hedges against the long term  fixed rate notes 
the arrangement is considered a highly effective hedge and  therefore  the accounting for these hedges has no impact on earnings 
the changes in the fair value of the hedge and the designated portion of the notes are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   we had no floating rate debt outstanding 
foreign exchange risk we have offices in countries and conduct operations through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local players in more than additional countries 
our international operations generated approximately of total revenue in as of december   approximately of our assets were located outside north america  and no country outside north america  other than the united kingdom  had a significant concentration of our aggregate cash balances 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of our international operations 
we follow a policy of hedging substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries 
from time to time  we may also hedge the value of our foreign currency denominated earnings and investments 
we use short term foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies 
typically  these contracts have maturities of twelve months or less 
these contracts are executed with creditworthy institutions and are denominated primarily in the british pound sterling and the euro 
as in prior years  we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts 
in addition  we used foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions 
the option contracts expired as of december  the underlying transactions and the corresponding forward exchange and option contracts are marked to market at the end of each quarter  and are reflected within our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  with net unrealized losses of million 
if exchange rates on average were to increase from year end levels  the unrealized loss would be approximately million 
if exchange rates on average were to decrease from year end levels  the unrealized loss would be approximately million 
however  the estimated potential gain and loss on these contracts is expected to be offset substantially by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions 
liquidity and financial position in accordance with our blueprint for growth strategy  we have used our cash for three primary purposes first  we have invested in our current business  such our proprietary dunsright tm quality process and new products and solutions such as our enterprise risk assessment manager  e portfolio  global decision maker tm  data integration toolkit tm and cim 
second  over the past three years we have made acquisitions such as data house  hoover s  and a controlling interest in three italian real estate data companies and ribes spa third  during  we spent million to repurchase  shares as part of the million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors 
this investment is in addition to  shares we repurchased for million to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued in connection with our stock incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan 
in january  our board of directors approved a new two year  million share repurchase program 
we believe that cash flows generated from our operations and supplemented as needed with readily available financing in the commercial paper markets are sufficient to meet our short term and long term needs  including the cash cost of our restructuring charges  transition costs  contractual obligations and contingencies see note to our consolidated financial statements  excluding the legal matters identified therein for which the exposures are not estimable 
we have the ability to access the commercial paper market from time to time to fund working capital needs and share repurchases if needed 
such borrowings would be supported by our bank credit facilities 
cash flow for the years ended december   and cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

if we fail to comply with certain covenants under our five year notes  the maturity of the notes could be accelerated 
we have been in compliance with these covenants since we issued the notes  and we believe that the likelihood is remote that we would fail to meet these covenants 
the cash proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to repay a million obligation resulting from the purchase of an unrelated partner s interest in a limited partnership 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a new multi year credit agreement  which will expire in september  and terminated our previous multi year and day credit agreements

payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter amounts in millions long term debt operating leases obligations to outsourcers pension and other postretirement benefits payments contributions spin off obligation our million debt obligation under our fixed rate notes is repayable in march most of our operations are conducted from leased facilities  which are under operating leases that expire over the next years  with the majority expiring within five years 
we also lease certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that expire over the next three years 
these leases are frequently renegotiated or otherwise changed as advancements in computer technology present opportunities to lower costs and improve performance 
in july  we outsourced certain technology functions to csc under a year agreement  which we may terminate for a fee at any time effective after july and under certain other conditions 
under the terms of the agreement  csc is responsible for the data center operations  technology help desk and network management functions in the united states and in the united kingdom and for certain application development and maintenance through july  in  we incurred million under this contract and have a remaining commitment of approximately million 
in december  we signed a three year agreement with ict group  inc ict  effective january  to outsource certain marketing calling activities 
we may terminate this agreement for a fee at any time 
under the terms of the agreement  ict will be responsible for performing certain marketing and credit calling activities previously performed by d b s own call centers in north america 
the obligation under the contract is based upon transmitted call volumes  but shall not be less than million per contract year 
in  we incurred million under this contract and have a remaining commitment of approximately million 
on october   we entered into a seven year outsourcing agreement with ibm 
under the terms of the agreement  we will transition certain portions of our data acquisition and delivery  customer service  and financial processes to ibm 
in addition  we can terminate at our discretion  subject to payment of termination fees that decline over the term  or for cause 
in  we incurred million under this contract and have a remaining commitment of approximately million 
pension and other postretirement benefits payments contributions represents projected contributions to our non us defined benefit plans as well as projected benefit payments related to our unfunded plans  including the us non qualified plans and our postretirement benefit plan 
we do not expect to make any contributions to our us qualified plan 
the expected benefits are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at the end of and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service 
a closed group approach is used in calculating the projected benefit payments  assuming only the participants who are currently in the valuation population are included in the projection and the projected benefits continue for approximately years 
as part of our spin off from moody s d b in  moody s and d b entered into a tax allocation agreement dated as of september  the taa 
under the taa  moody s d b and d b agreed that moody s d b would be entitled to deduct compensation expense associated with the exercise of moody s d b stock options including moody s d b options exercised by d b employees and d b would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with the exercise of d b stock options including d b options exercised by employees of moody s d b 
put simply  the tax deduction goes to the issuing company of the stock option 
the taa provides  however  that if the irs issues rules  regulations or other authority contrary to the agreed upon treatment of the tax deductions thereunder  then the party that becomes then entitled to take the deduction may be required to indemnify the other party for the loss of such deduction 
the irs issued rulings discussing an employer s entitlement to stock option deductions after a spin off or liquidation that appears to require that the tax deduction belongs to the employer of the optionee and not the issuer of the option 
accordingly  under the taa  we received the benefit of additional tax deductions and under the taa we may be required to reimburse moody s d b for the loss of income tax deductions relating to and of approximately million in the aggregate for such years 
this potential reimbursement is a reduction to shareholders equity and has no impact on eps 
financial flexibility program in  we will continue to implement our flexible business model through the following improving operating efficiency with a focus on evaluating opportunities in our international segment  and leveraging current outsourcing partners and vendors to drive quality and cost efficiencies primarily in the area of technology 
we expect to complete all actions under the financial flexibility program by december on an annualized basis  these actions are expected to create million to million of financial flexibility approximately million in  before any restructuring charges and transition costs and before any reallocation of spending 
to implement these measures and complete our program  we expect to incur transition costs of approximately million to million 
in addition  we expect to incur non core restructuring charges totaling approximately million to million pre tax  of which million to million relate to severance and termination costs and million to million relate to lease termination obligations and other exit costs  in the million to million pre tax charge includes approximately million of restructuring charges to complete the ibm outsourcing 
approximately million to million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures 
share repurchases and dividends in february  we announced that our board of directors authorized a new million two year share repurchase program 
this program is in addition to our existing share repurchase program to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under employee benefit plans 
we expect to fund the program from cash on hand and to execute the program evenly over the next two year period 
through february   we repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
we have not paid cash dividends since we separated from moody s in  and we have decided to continue this policy 
potential payments in tax and legal matters we and our predecessors are involved in certain tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are at various stages of resolution  but could ultimately result in significant cash payments as described in item legal proceedings 
we believe we have adequate reserves recorded in our consolidated financial statements for our share of current exposures in these matters 
pension plan and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements for financial statement reporting purposes  the funded status of our pension plans  as determined in accordance with gaap  was a surplus of million for the us qualified plan  a deficit of million for the us non qualified plans  and a deficit of million for the non us plans at december   compared to a surplus of million  a deficit of million  and a deficit of million  respectively  at december  the deterioration in funded status was due primarily to the higher projected benefit obligation at december  driven by the lower interest rate  other assumption changes and experience loss during the year  partially offset by the gains in the plans equity investments 
this is detailed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
for funding purposes  governed by the internal revenue service regulations  we are not required to contribute to the us qualified plan  the largest of our six plans  in as the plan is considered fully funded under the provisions of the internal revenue code 
if the us qualified plan asset returns are flat and the assets decline by the amount of benefits paid to plan participants  and all other factors affecting when contributions are required remain the same  we would not be required to make contributions to this plan until if plan assets appreciate between now and  the need to make a required contribution would be delayed beyond if plan assets depreciate  we could be required to make contributions sooner than in addition  if the us congress renews the pension funding equity act  we could delay contributions beyond  assuming there is no return on plan assets 
this act includes a provision governing the current liability interest rate to be used beginning in for calculating the additional funding requirement under the internal revenue code 
however  the act provides only two years of relief 
whether or not contributions are required  we may voluntarily make contributions to this plan sooner than  if allowable under internal revenue code funding provisions 
we expect to continue to make cash contributions to our five other pension plans in the expected contribution amount is approximately million  compared with million in in addition  we expect to make benefit payment related to our postretirement benefit plan of approximately million in  compared with million in see the table of contractual cash obligations on page for projected contributions and benefit payments beyond off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions we do not have any transactions  obligations or relationships that could be considered off balance sheet arrangements 
additionally  we have not engaged in any significant related party transactions 
forward looking statements we may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements  including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission  in reports to shareholders and in press releases and investor webcasts 
these forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words like anticipates  aspirations  believes  continues  estimates  expects  goals  guidance  intends  plans  projects  strategy  targets  will and other words of similar meaning 
they can also be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
we cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and whether to invest in  or remain invested in  our securities 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we are identifying in the following paragraphs important factors that  individually or in the aggregate  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by us  any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements 
demand for our products is subject to intense competition  changes in customer preferences and  to a lesser extent  economic conditions 
our results are dependent upon our continued ability to successfully manage our outsource vendors and our strategic partners in our international segment and fully realize expected dunsright tm quality process improvements  effectively communicate and sell the value of our dunsright tm quality process to our customers  improve customer satisfaction and increase penetration into existing customer accounts  reallocate expenses to invest for growth through our financial flexibility program  accurately forecast cost increases associated with increasing revenue growth  accurately forecast the cost of complying with increasing regulatory requirements  such as sarbanes oxley requirements  invest in our database and maintain our reputation for providing reliable data  execute our plan to improve the business model of our international segment and thereby improve our global data quality while realizing improved financial performance  including operating margins  in that segment  manage employee satisfaction and maintain our global expertise as we implement our financial flexibility program  protect against damage or interruptions affecting our database or our data centers  develop new products or enhance existing ones to meet customer needs  sustain growth in the context of our competition  including challenges to our e business in light of the acquisition of onesource by i usa  the launch of competitive products  the potential improvement of other pan european networks in europe  and the efforts by equifax to grow their position in the small business decision making market  and implement pricing programs and policies that enable us to capture the additional value we provide through enhanced data and services 
we are also subject to the effects of foreign economies  exchange rate fluctuations  us and foreign legislative or regulatory requirements  and the adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies 
our results are also dependent upon the availability of data for our database and the ability of our strategic partners to fulfill their contractual obligations to satisfy our customers and promote and protect the d b brand 
in addition  the company s ability to repurchase shares is subject to market conditions  including trading volume in the company s stock 
developments in any of these areas could cause our results to differ materially from results that have been or may be projected 
with respect to the ultimate resolution or settlement of our tax legacy matters  the final amounts payable by us may differ from the estimates reflected in our current reserves due to a number of factors  including judicial  legislative and or regulatory developments  the terms of any final settlement agreements  final interest computations  the terms of the tax sharing agreements  and the other parties having a contractual obligation to pay a portion of this liability paying their allocable share on a timely basis 
we elaborate on the above list of important factors throughout this document and in our other filings with the sec  particularly in the discussion of our prominent trends  risks and uncertainties  below 
it should be understood that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors 
consequently  the above list of important factors or the trends  risks and uncertainties discussed below should not be considered to be a complete discussion of all our potential trends  risks and uncertainties 
we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement we may make from time to time 
trends  risks and uncertainties we may be unable to achieve our revenue and earnings per share growth targets 
we have established revenue and earnings per share growth targets for and aspirations for the long term 
while we made progress towards our goals and believe our initiatives to transform our business have established a platform to reach these goals  we have not yet achieved our aspiration to attain our revenue growth goals on a sustainable basis 
in order to reach our aspiration  we are undertaking a number of initiatives to both increase and maintain our revenue in each of our product lines  including scaling high growth products  such as our self awareness solution 
while we believe that our initiatives in each product line will be sufficient to achieve and maintain our desired revenue growth  no assurance can be made as to when or if we will be successful 
a failure to reach and maintain our desired revenue growth or to continue to reach our earnings per share growth could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
we may be unable to reduce our expense base through our financial flexibility program  and the related reinvestments from savings from this program may not produce the level of desired revenue growth 
successful execution of our blueprint for growth strategy will include reducing our expense base through our financial flexibility program  and reallocating our expense base reductions into initiatives that produce our desired revenue growth 
the success of this program may be affected by our ability to implement all of the actions required under this program within the established timeframe  to enter into or amend agreements with third party vendors to renegotiate terms beneficial to the company  and to complete agreements with our local works councils and trade unions related to potential reengineering actions in certain international markets 
while we have been successful at reducing our expense base to date  our reallocations into initiatives have not yet resulted in a sustained level of revenue growth over a multi year period 
if we fail to continue to reduce our expense base  or if we do not achieve our desired level of revenue growth  the market value of our common stock may suffer 
we are dependent upon third parties for certain services 
as part of our financial flexibility programs  we have outsourced various functions  including certain of our data center operations and development functions  as well as certain portions of our data acquisition and delivery  customer service and financial processes 
if one of the third party providers were to experience financial or operational difficulties  their services to us may suffer 
data suppliers might withdraw data from us  leading to our inability to provide products and services 
we obtain much of the data that we use from third parties  direct contact with businesses through our call centers  and by purchasing data from public record sources 
as we implement business model changes in various countries in our international segment  we are entering into agreements with a single provider for all of our local data requirements from those countries 
we could suffer a material adverse effect if owners or providers of the data we use were to withdraw the data  cease making the data available  or not adhere to our data quality requirements 
if a substantial number of data providers were to withdraw their data  cease making it available  or not adhere to our data quality standards  our ability to provide products and services to our customers could be materially adversely impacted  which could result in decreased revenue  net income and earnings per share 
we may be unable to adapt successfully to changes in our customers preferences for our products 
our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products to our customers preferences 
advances in information technology and uncertain or changing economic conditions are changing the way our customers use business information 
as a result  our customers are demanding lower prices and more from our products  such as decision making tools like credit scores and electronic delivery formats 
for example  our customers have been switching from our traditional products such as the business information report  or bir  which generally offer raw information  to other lower priced products that offer credit ratings and decisions 
if we do not successfully adapt our products to our customers preferences  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we face competition that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 
we are subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
we compete directly with a broad range of companies offering business information services to customers 
we have faced increased competition from consumer credit companies that offer consumer information products to help their customers make credit decisions regarding small businesses 
we discuss further competitive conditions within our segments under item competition above 
we also face competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and other business information services  other information and professional service providers  and credit insurers 
in addition  business information products and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information products and services 
weak economic conditions can result in customers seeking to utilize free or lower cost information that is available from alternative sources such as the internet and european commission sponsored projects like the european business register 
intense competition could harm us by causing  among other things  price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we are undertaking various initiatives in our international segment that are critical to achieving our aspiration  which may not be successful 
the success of our initiatives in our international segment is important to our ability to achieve our aspiration 
these initiatives are primarily focused on improving our competitive position while improving our operating margins in our international segment  both by increasing revenue and lowering our expense base 
examples of initiatives we are undertaking are implementing specific process re engineering projects designed to improve efficiency and productivity in our business  and optimizing revenue and profits realized by the sale of data collected by partner organizations in certain markets 
there can be no assurance that these or other initiatives we may undertake will be successful in attaining a consistent and sustainable level of improved international financial performance 
for example  we may not reduce costs of our operations through re engineering to the extent expected due to challenges in implementing new technology plans  or our efforts by partner organizations to increase the value of the data they provide us may not result in significant improvements in data quality 
if we fail to improve the financial performance of our international segment  the market value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
our operations in the international segment are subject to various risks associated with operations in foreign countries 
our success depends in part on our various operations outside the united states 
our international segment accounted for of our total revenue in our international businesses are subject to many challenges  the most significant being we do not have market leadership positions in all countries in which we operate  making us particularly susceptible to competitive pressures  our competition is primarily local  and our customers may have greater loyalty to our local competitors  credit insurance is a significant credit risk mitigation tool in certain markets  thus reducing the demand for information based credit risk mitigation tools  such as those offered by us  in some markets  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources  thus reducing our data collection advantage  and prior to the launch of our blueprint for growth strategy in october  our investment decisions were made at the country level and not in a coordinated fashion 
while we have made significant investments to mitigate this situation  we are still faced with uneven data quality in some local markets 
our international strategy includes forming strategic relationships in certain markets with third parties to improve our data quality 
while we are applying methodical processes to ensure these alliances will create a competitive advantage for d b  there are no assurances that these alliances will be successful 
the issue of data privacy is an increasingly important area of public policy in various european markets  and we operate in an evolving regulatory environment that could adversely impact aspects of our business 
our operating results could also be negatively affected by a variety of other factors affecting our foreign operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include currency fluctuations  economic  political or regulatory conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements 
additional risks inherent in international business activities generally include  among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles  the costs and difficulties of managing international operations and alliances  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights  and the need to comply with a broader array of regulatory and licensing requirements  the failure of which could result in fines  penalties or business suspensions 
our results of operations may suffer if the economy weakens 
demand for some of our products is influenced by economic trends 
if the economy weakens  we may experience a reduction in the demand for certain of our products as customers look for ways to reduce their expenses 
economic weakness may also result in certain of our customers going out of business or combining with other companies 
when companies combine  their post consolidation spending on our products is invariably less than their aggregate pre consolidation spending 
in addition  companies may streamline their credit departments  thus reducing the number of users of our products 
customers may also take longer to make spending decisions  causing us to expend greater resources and divert sales resources from other opportunities  negotiate harder on price  and seek cheaper alternatives to our products 
in challenging economic times  price competition may increase  which adversely impacts our revenue and profit margins 
we could be harmed by a failure in the integrity of our database 
the reliability of our products is dependent upon the integrity of the data in our global database 
we have in the past been subject to customer and third party inquiries  complaints and lawsuits regarding our data  including claims based on theories of negligence and libel 
a failure in the integrity of our database could harm us by exposing us to customer or third party claims or by causing a loss of customer confidence in our products 
also  we have licensed  and we may license in the future  proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by the business partners to whom we grant non exclusive licenses  they may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
in addition  it cannot be assured that these licensees will take the same steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our solutions or technologies 
we rely on annual contract renewals 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from annual customer contracts 
if we are unable to renew a significant number of these contracts  our revenue and results of operations would be harmed 
we may not be able to grow the e business component of our strategy 
one component of our blueprint for growth strategy was to become an important player on the web 
to implement this component  we acquired a web based business hoover s and transitioned our business to a web based business model 
there are risks associated with a web based business model 
for example  our business will suffer if we are unable to successfully utilize marketing to acquire  retain and grow web based customers  successfully accelerate the overall growth of the hoover s business  successfully develop new features to justify higher price points for hoover s services  develop products that are understandable and easy to use over the web  minimize disruptions in our service and other system failures that reduce customer satisfaction  develop features and sales channels in support of increasing market penetration of enterprise customers  minimize difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of our web based products  and successfully expand the use of hoover s into international markets 
we may lose key business assets  including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links or power sources 
our operations depend on our ability  as well as that of third party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions  to protect our data centers and related technology against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or other disasters 
the on line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers 
we believe reasonable precautions are in place to protect our data centers and telecommunications links from events that could interrupt operations 
nonetheless  any damage to our data centers or any failure of our telecommunications links that causes interruptions in operations could materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements  which could result in decreased revenue  net income and earnings per share 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings that could have a material effect on us 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business 
as discussed in greater detail under item legal proceedings above  certain of these matters could have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
acquisitions may disrupt or otherwise have a negative impact on our business 
as part of our strategy  we may seek to acquire other complementary businesses  products and technologies 
acquisitions are subject to the following risks acquisitions may cause a disruption in our ongoing business  distract our management and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures  we may not be able to integrate successfully the services  content  products and personnel of any acquisition into our operations  and we may not derive the revenue improvements  cost savings and other intended benefits of any acquisition 
changes in the legislative  regulatory and commercial environments may adversely affect our ability to collect  manage  aggregate and use data 
certain types of information we gather  compile and publish are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in certain markets in which we operate  particularly in europe 
in addition  there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public regarding marketing and privacy matters  particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests and the ubiquity of the internet 
these concerns may result in new laws and regulations 
compliance with existing laws and regulations has not to date seriously affected our business  financial condition or results of operations 
nonetheless  future laws and regulations with respect to the collection  management and use of information  and adverse publicity or litigation concerning the commercial use of such information  could affect our operations 
this could result in substantial regulatory compliance or litigation expense or a loss of revenue 
italian tax legislation as further described above in the section segment results international  on february   regulations implementing new tax legislation became effective in italy that are expected to significantly increase the cost of conducting our italian real estate data information business by up to approximately million in specifically  the regulations increase data acquisition costs for italian real estate information and require that we pay a fee each time we resell or license that data 
our plan is to fully address the increased costs through price increases to our customers to mitigate the impact to our operating income  however  for the reasons stated herein  it is too early to predict the final impact that this new legislation and related regulations will ultimately have on our italian real estate data information business 
changes in the legislative or regulatory environments may adversely affect our benefits plans 
last year  the united states district court for the southern district of illinois affirmed its earlier ruling that ibm s cash balance pension plan violated the age discrimination provisions of erisa 
ibm has announced  however  that it will appeal this decision  and the treasury department recently proposed legislation to clarify that cash balance plans do not violate the age discrimination rules if they meet certain criteria 
therefore  it is not possible at this time to determine whether the ibm ruling will ultimately have any material effect on our cash balance plan or our financial position
