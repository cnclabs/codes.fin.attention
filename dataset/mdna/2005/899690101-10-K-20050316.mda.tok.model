item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those listed under risks and uncertainties 
overview we are a recognized leader in providing secure internet communication solutions for enterprises and government customers of all sizes 
with our products  organizations can block security threats  protect information  safely conduct business online  and reduce their cost of doing business 
our operating results during showed improvement relative to in revenue  deferred revenue  net loss  and operating cash flow 
our growth in revenue and growth in deferred revenue were driven by a number of factors including increased customer adoption of our email firewall products  increased sales of the securetransport product acquired in the valicert acquisition  revenue from the anti spam appliance product acquired in the corvigo  inc corvigo acquisition  and growth in our targeted customer sectors in the financial services  health care  and government industries 
our reduction in net loss of was due to our growth in revenues and our continuing focus on generating cost efficiencies including our development center in bulgaria  which allowed us to augment our research and development and services offerings at a lower cost structure 
the percentage improvement in net loss was less than the percentage improvement in revenue primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing expenses driven by decisions to increase sales and marketing headcount and marketing programs to expand our sales presence  increase our marketing resources  and grow our revenues 
these decisions included the acquisitions of valicert  incubator  limited incubator  and corvigo 
we had positive cash flow from operations of  in outlook we believe that our success in will depend on our ability to increase customer adoption of our mailgate email security  securetransport  and validation authority products  the ability to successfully expand our sales through distribution by third party resellers  our ability to further implement the processes related to selling hardware appliance products  such as supply chain effectiveness  and our ability to maintain control over expenses and cash 
we believe that key risks include overall economic conditions and the overall level of information technology spending  economic and business conditions within our target customer sectors in the financial services  health care  and government industries  timing of the closure of customer contracts  growing our sales internationally  and competitive factors in our rapidly changing industry 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly given that we operate in rapidly evolving markets  have completed several acquisitions and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties 
please refer to the risks and uncertainties section for additional information

the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in determining the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  customer arrangements  collectibility of accounts receivable  valuation of assets  and contingencies and litigation 
when making estimates  we consider our historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent areas where significant judgments and estimates have been used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from three sources i product revenue  which includes license fees for products sold as software or on appliances  subscription based license fees  and transaction based license fees  ii service revenue  which includes support and maintenance fees  consulting fees  and training fees  and iii intellectual property and other revenue which includes patent license agreement fees and the sale of distribution rights 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period based on the judgments and estimates made by our management 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products  we must evaluate whether i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we apply these criteria as discussed below 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we require a written contract  signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement with us prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 

table of contents delivery has occurred 
we deliver software to our customers physically or electronically 
for physical deliveries  our standard transfer terms are typically fob shipping point 
for electronic deliveries  delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes or keys that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software on its hardware 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard payment terms require the arrangement fee to be due within days 
where these terms apply  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and we recognize revenue upon delivery assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the payment terms do not meet this standard  which we refer to as extended payment terms  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees  which we do on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for new customers  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay 
if we determine that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue when cash is collected 
we allocate revenue on software transactions referred to as an arrangement in the accounting literature involving multiple elements to each undelivered element based on their respective fair values 
the residual is allocated to the product license 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
we must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable  including review of historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  aging of the balance and estimated collectibility percentages for different aging ranges  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 

table of contents we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with sfas if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired  we make an assessment of the impairment of the goodwill using the two step method prescribed by sfas any such impairment charge could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges on our goodwill during or  respectively 
during the six months ended june   tkk experienced a sustained decline in operations 
as a result  we reevaluated our future prospects in japan and decided to transition to an indirect sales distribution model in japan 
as of june   we determined that our goodwill related to tkk was impaired and wrote off the million remainder of the goodwill balance as impairment of goodwill in our consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we had goodwill of million 
accrual for anticipated operating lease losses during we recognized a charge of  related to potential losses on an operating lease in slough  united kingdom that was included in our consolidated statement of operations as merger related and other costs 
the charge was estimated to include required dilapidations  remaining lease liabilities  and brokerage fees  offset by estimated sublease income 
during we recognized an additional charge of  on this same lease that was included in our consolidated statement of operations as merger related and other costs due to a revised estimate of the term of expected subleases on the building 
during we recognized a charge of  related to potential losses on an operating lease in palo alto  california that was included in our consolidated statement of operations as merger related and other costs 
the charge was estimated to include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees  offset by estimated sublease income 
this office space was subleased in december for the remainder of the lease term with sublease rental income less than tumbleweed s rent payments due to a weak office rental market in and around palo alto 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with a sublessee  sublease rates  and brokerage fees 
each reporting period we review these estimates  and to the extent that our assumptions change and or actual charges are incurred  the ultimate charge for the loss on these operating leases could vary from our current estimates 
risks and uncertainties we have a history of losses and may experience losses in the future 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses  delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies engaged in rapidly evolving technology markets like ours 
we incurred net losses of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as of december   we had incurred cumulative net losses of million 
our success may depend in large part upon the adoption and utilization of our products and technology  as well as our ability to effectively maintain existing relationships and develop new relationships with customers and strategic partners 
if we do not succeed in doing so  we may not achieve or maintain profitability on a timely basis or at all 
in particular  we intend to expend significant financial and management resources on product development  sales and marketing  strategic relationships  technology and operating infrastructure 
as a result  we may incur additional losses and continued negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
if we do not successfully optimize our marketing and distribution capacity  our business could be harmed 
if we do not optimize our methods of marketing and selling our products  it could significantly limit our ability to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and rapidly changing  in part because third parties such as hackers and spammers whose timing and methods are somewhat unpredictable can have a significant impact on customer demand 
vendors in our markets use different methods of marketing and distribution in order to meet expected customer demand 
for 
table of contents example  our competitors in the anti spam market include multiple software only vendors  appliance only vendors  and service providers  as well as vendors that offer a combination of some or all of the foregoing 
moreover  vendors offerings range from single function point products and services to more sophisticated and scalable multi functional offerings 
in addition  pricing and other terms and conditions of sales contracts also vary considerably among our competition 
because it is difficult to predict demand in our rapidly changing markets  we may not be able to manage our marketing and sales efforts in an optimal way  which may disadvantage our business in comparison to competitors 
additional competitive factors in our industry include product performance and integration  platform coverage  worldwide sales infrastructure and global technical support 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources than we do  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base 
additionally  some of these competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with product lines we market and distribute 
we expect that the market for email and data security products will become more consolidated with larger companies being better positioned to compete in such an environment in the long term 
as this market continues to develop  a number of companies with greater resources than ours could attempt to increase their presence in this market by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors or business partners 
our success will depend on our ability to adapt to these competing forces  to develop more effective products more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors  and to educate potential customers as to the benefits of licensing our products rather than developing their own products 
competitors could introduce products with superior features  scalability and functionality at lower prices than our products and could also bundle existing or new products with other more established products in order to compete with us 
in addition  because there are relatively low barriers to entry for the software market  we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
our success depends on our ability to grow and develop our indirect distribution channels and the inability to do so could adversely affect future operating results 
our failure to increase revenue through our indirect distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we must increase the number of strategic and other third party relationships with vendors of internet related systems and application software  resellers and systems integrators 
our existing or future channel partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies 
the volume of spam may not continue to grow rapidly  which may adversely affect the market for anti spam solutions 
although the volume of spam has grown rapidly during the last several years  it may not continue to do so because of recently enacted anti spam legislation  enforcement efforts under that legislation  and collaborative efforts by leaders of the email provider industry  as well as the potential development of new and successful anti spam technologies 
accordingly  the market for anti spam solutions may not continue to grow rapidly and may in fact decline  which may adversely affect our business 
contractual issues may arise during the negotiation of license agreements that may delay the anticipated closure of a transaction and our ability to recognize revenue as anticipated 
because we focus on selling enterprise wide software products to enterprises and government entities  the process of contractual negotiation is critical and may be lengthy 
additionally  many factors may require us to defer recognition of license revenue for a significant period of time after entering into a license agreement 

table of contents many customers negotiate software licenses near the end of each quarter 
in part  this is because customers are able  or believe that they are able  to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms at that time 
our reliance on a large portion of software license revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of a quarter can result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues 
due to end of period variances  forecasts may not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us 
a limited number of customers account for a high percentage of our revenue  and the failure to maintain or expand these relationships could adversely affect our future revenue 
the loss of one or more of our major customers  the failure to attract new customers on a timely basis or a reduction in revenue associated with existing or proposed customers would harm our future revenue and prospects 
for  and  five customers comprised approximately   and  respectively  of our revenue 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  no single customer comprised or more of our revenue 
the market in which we participate is intensely competitive  and if we do not compete effectively  our operating results could be harmed 
the market for secure internet communications is intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
barriers to entry into this market are relatively low  many of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do  and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants  we expect competition to intensify in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages  such as greater name recognition  larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial  technical and other resources 
in addition  many of our current and potential competitors have access to larger customer bases and have more extensive marketing and distribution arrangements with resellers  distributors and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
furthermore  because of these advantages  even if our products are more effective than the products that our competitors offer  potential customers might accept competitive products in lieu of purchasing our products 
we face competition from businesses that develop their own secure internet communications technology  as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who develop or bundle technology similar to our products with their other products 
our current and potential principal competitors include for our mailgate email security solutions are companies that offer various email content filtering and anti spam products 
some of the companies that sell products that compete with some of the features within our products include clearswift limited  ciphertrust  inc  proofpoint  inc  symantec corp  and zix corporation 
for our securetransport solutions comes from software and service providers that include sterling commerce a division of sbc communications  inc  cyclone commerce  inc  and standard networks  inc 
for our validation authority solution comes primarily from software providers including corestreet ltd  sytrust technologies gmbh  and alacris inc in addition  we may face competition from large enterprise network infrastructure and software vendors such as cisco systems and microsoft as they diversify their product offerings 

table of contents fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may not be predictable and may result in significant volatility in our stock price 
our product revenue has fluctuated and our quarterly operating results may continue to fluctuate based on  among other things  the timing of the execution and termination of customer agreements in a given quarter 
in addition  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in revenue and operating results from quarter to quarter for other reasons  including  but not limited to target customers electing to adopt and implement our technology  the substantial decrease in information technology spending in general  and among our target customers in particular  customers choosing to delay their purchase commitments or purchase in smaller amounts than expected due to a general downturn in the economy  our ability to continue to license our patents  the timing of such licenses  and the costs necessary to defend our patents  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to our business  operations and infrastructure  our ability to accurately estimate and control costs  our ability to timely collect fees owed by customers  the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products and services in the secure content management  content security  secure online communications  or document delivery markets  and acquisitions that we complete or propose 
as a result of these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that these comparisons may not be accurate indicators of future performance 
we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue or expenses 
because our staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels  and because a high percentage of our costs are fixed  small variations in the timing of the recognition of specific revenue could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  many of our customers delay purchases of our products until the end of each quarter 
if we are unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  any significant revenue shortfall would likely have an immediate negative effect on our operating results 
moreover  we believe the challenges and difficulties that we face  as outlined above with respect to financial forecasts  also apply to securities analysts that may publish estimates of our financial results 
our operating results in the past have  and in future quarters may  fail to meet our expectations or those of securities analysts or our investors due to any of a wide variety of factors  including fluctuations in financial ratios or other metrics used to measure our performance 
if this occurs  we would expect to experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our stock 
economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to maintain and increase revenue 
our revenue and profitability or loss depends on the overall demand for our products  our intellectual property  and our services  particularly within the industries in which we offer specific versions of our products 
because our sales are primarily to customers in the financial services  health care  and government industries  our business depends on the overall economic conditions and the economic and business conditions within these industries 
any weakening of the global economy  the information technology industry in particular  and the weakening of the business conditions within the above industries could cause a decrease in our license revenues 
a softening of demand for information technology spending caused by a continued weakening of the economy  domestically or internationally  may result in a decrease in revenues and continued losses 

table of contents in addition  the financial  political  economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the united states and the united states involvement in iraq have led to a further weakening of the global economy  and have created an uncertain economic environment 
we cannot predict the impact of these events  any subsequent terrorist acts or any related military action  on our customers or business 
subsequent terrorist acts and or the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the united states or other countries could adversely affect spending on information technology and on our software license revenue  as well as have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions  which may involve substantial costs  may substantially dilute our existing investors  and may fail to yield anticipated benefits 
we are continuously evaluating investments in complementary technologies and businesses 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products  including our acquisitions of valicert  incubator  and corvigo  entail numerous risks  including potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration  the inability to recognize revenue from target acquisitions in accordance with our expectations  diversion of management s attention  loss of key employees of acquired operations  coordinating sales and pricing efforts to effectively communicate the value and capabilities of the combined company  integrating technologies and product lines  the difficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the correct assessment of the relative percentages of in process research and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to the amount which must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers of either an acquired company or our business  and the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired business 
as a result of acquisitions  we may acquire significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions 
changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets 
companies changes to their procurement cycles in response to the sarbanes oxley act of  may delay sales of our products 
many companies have recently instituted changes to their corporate governance practices  internal control policies and audit committee procedures in response to the sarbanes oxley act of these changes  in turn  may require increased oversight by these companies of their procurement practices 
to the extent our potential customers must direct additional management attention and resources to their procurement processes  our sales cycle could lengthen and our revenue could be adversely affected 

table of contents our stock price could be adversely affected if we are unable to favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if our auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of and beginning with our annual report on form k for the year ending december   our management is required to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
our management has favorably assessed  and our independent registered public accounting firm has provided an unqualified report on  our internal controls over financial reporting as of december  the rules governing the standards that must be met are new and complex  and require significant documentation  testing  and possible remediation 
the process of reviewing  documenting and testing our internal controls over financial reporting  has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased expenses and the devotion of significant management and other internal resources 
in the future  we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  in the future  in connection with the attestation process by our independent registered public accounting firm  we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation 
if we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report on our assessment  investor confidence and our stock price could be adversely affected 
the terms of any financing we may obtain could result in substantial dilution of existing stockholders 
in the future  we may be required or elect to seek additional financing to fund our operations 
factors such as the commercial success of our existing products and services  the timing and success of any new products and services  the progress of our research and development efforts  our results of operations  the status of competitive products and services  and the timing and success of potential strategic alliances or potential opportunities to acquire or sell technologies or assets may require us to seek additional funding sooner than we expect 
in the event that we require additional cash  we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us  especially in light of uncertainty in the current market environment  and we may not be successful in implementing or negotiating such other arrangements to improve our cash position 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced and the securities we issue might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
if adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms or at all  our ability to achieve or sustain positive cash flows  maintain current operations  fund any potential expansion  take advantage of new opportunities  develop or enhance products or services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage or prevent an acquisition of us  which could depress our stock price 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  may discourage or prevent an acquisition or disposition of our business 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit changes of control that are not approved by our board of directors 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in particular  our certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors and prohibits stockholder action by written consent 
these provisions require advance notice for nomination of directors and stockholders proposals 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  this law prevents a person who becomes the owner of or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock from engaging in specified business combinations for three years unless specified conditions are satisfied 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval 
this could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in 
table of contents control 
the issuance of preferred stock also could effectively limit the voting power of the holders of our common stock 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be subject to claims of patent infringement  either of which could result in substantial costs to us 
we currently rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks and licenses  together with non disclosure and confidentiality agreements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products 
we hold certain patent rights with respect to some of our products 
our existing patents or trademarks  as well as any future patents or trademarks obtained by us  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information 
although we take precautionary measures to maintain our unpatented proprietary information  others may acquire equivalent information or otherwise gain access to or disclose our proprietary information  and we may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights to our proprietary information 
as a result  our operating results could suffer 
third parties could assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against us and the cost of responding to such assertions  regardless of their validity  could be significant 
we may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of our competitors grows and the functionality of their products and services increasingly overlap with ours 
in addition  we may infringe upon patents that may be issued to third parties in the future 
it may be time consuming and costly to defend ourselves against any of these claims and we may not prevail 
furthermore  parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could block our ability to further develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the united states and abroad 
in the event of a claim of infringement  we may be required to obtain one or more licenses from or pay royalties to third parties 
we may be unable to obtain any such licenses at a reasonable cost  if at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain such license could harm our business 
the enforcement of our intellectual property rights  especially through patent infringement lawsuits we may initiate  could result in substantial litigation costs and ultimately may not result in additional revenue to us or a favorable judicial determination 
since we have aggressively pursued cases of potential infringement by third parties of our patents and other intellectual property rights 
the enforcement process is costly and requires significant management attention 
these costs are expensed during the period incurred  and the costs of pursuing the litigation may not be directly matched with the related patent license agreement revenue  if any 
in addition  our enforcement of our rights may increase the risk of adverse claims  with or without merit  which could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  limit the use of our services  or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
in addition  such counter claims asserted by these third parties may be found to be valid and could result in an injunction or damages against us 
our ability to prevail in this litigation is inherently uncertain  and if we were subject to an adverse judicial determination  our ability to protect our products and to secure related licensing or settlement revenue could be lost 
failure to license necessary third party software incorporated in our products could cause delays or reductions in our sales 
we license third party software that we incorporate into our products 
these licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
some of this technology would be difficult to replace 
the loss of any such license could result in delays or reductions of our applications until we identify  license and integrate or develop equivalent software 
if we are required to enter into license agreements with third parties for replacement technology  we could face higher royalty payments and our products may lose certain attributes or features 
in the future  we might need to license other software to enhance our products and meet evolving customer needs 
if we are unable to do this  we could experience reduced demand for our products 

table of contents the inclusion of appliance products in our product portfolio exposes us to hardware supply chain issues  which  if not managed properly  could harm our revenue and gross margin 
as a result of the product and technology acquired in the corvigo acquisition  we have seen an increase in sales of our products sold as hardware appliances  which are manufactured by a third party 
the inclusion of these hardware appliances in our product portfolio subjects us to additional risks  including  but not limited to the inability to deliver appliance products to customers in a timely manner  harming our ability to win time sensitive customer contracts and or recognize revenue  product shortages that could result in increased product costs  price increases from suppliers that may not be able to be passed on to customers  oversupply of inventory  which may result in the need to reduce our prices and or write down inventory  and product quality issues 
managing these risks may subject us to additional costs that may not be justified in light of the market opportunity 
we are a defendant in two purported securities class action lawsuits that could divert management attention and resources or eventually expose us to liability 
in june  we were served with a summons and first amended complaint  captioned liu v 
credit suisse first boston  et alia  alleging the violation of federal and state securities laws  purportedly on behalf of persons who acquired our common stock other than purchasers of our initial public offering from august  to october  the case is now pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york

an adverse outcome in this case could harm our business and operating results 
moreover  the costs in defending this lawsuit could harm future operating results 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include a reserve for any potential loss  as we do not consider a loss to be probable at this time

in june  valicert accepted a settlement proposal presented to all issuer defendants in this case 
under the proposed settlement  the plaintiffs will dismiss and release all claims against the valicert defendants in exchange for a contingent payment guaranty by the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the issuers in all the consolidated cases  and the assignment or surrender of control to the plaintiffs of certain claims the issuer defendants may have against the underwriters 
under the guaranty  the insurers will be required to pay the amount  if any  by which billion exceeds the aggregate amount ultimately collected by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants in all of the cases 
if the plaintiffs fail to recover billion and payment is required under the guaranty  valicert would be responsible to pay its pro rata portion of the shortfall  up to the amount of the deductible retention under its insurance policy  which is  the timing and amount of payments that valicert could be required to make under the proposed settlement will depend on several factors  principally the timing and amount of any payment required by the insurers pursuant to the billion guaranty 
the proposed settlement is subject to approval of the court  which cannot be assured 
failure of the court to approve the settlement followed by an adverse outcome could harm our business and operating results 
moreover  the costs in defending this lawsuit could harm future operating results 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include a reserve for any potential loss  as we do not consider a loss to be probable at this time 

table of contents if we lose the services of executive officers or other key employees  our ability to develop our business and secure customer relationships will suffer 
we are actively seeking a new chief executive officer in connection with the january announcement that jeffrey c 
smith  our current chief executive officer  had notified tumbleweed that he would like to step down as chief executive officer at such time as tumbleweed secures a qualified successor 
we are actively engaged in the search process and currently anticipate we will hire a new chief executive officer in we are substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
the loss of services of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could significantly harm our business and prospects 
our international business exposes us to additional risks that may result in future additional costs or limit the market for product sales 
products and services provided to tumbleweed s international customers accounted for   and of our revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
conducting business outside of the united states subjects us to additional risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  evolving privacy laws  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  and difficulties in authenticating customer information 
managing these risks may subject us to additional costs that may not be justified in light of the market opportunity  and the inability to comply with or manage foreign laws and related risks may preclude or limit sales in foreign jurisdictions 
we rely on public key cryptography and other security techniques that could be breached  resulting in reduced demand for our products and services 
a requirement for the continued growth of electronic commerce is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
we rely on public key cryptography  an encryption method that utilizes two keys  a public and private key  for encoding and decoding data  and on digital certificate technology  to provide the security and authentication necessary for secure transmission of confidential information 
regulatory and export restrictions may prohibit us from using the strongest and most secure cryptographic protection available  and thereby may expose us or our customers to a risk of data interception 
a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or interrupt our or our customers operations 
any compromise or elimination of our security could result in risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and reduce demand for our products and services 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in bulgaria  japan  the netherlands  switzerland  or the united kingdom denominated in the respective local currency 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 

table of contents we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed rate equal to the then prevailing interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in commercial paper and money market funds 
in general  our investments are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   none of our cash equivalents were subject to market risk
