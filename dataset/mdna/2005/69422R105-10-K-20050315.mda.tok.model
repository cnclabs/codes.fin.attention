for the periods prior to july   the date of our initial public offering  the financial data and results of operations for pps  pmt  rmps and rpl  are presented on a combined basis and constitute the predecessor 
the financial data included herein reflects i the ownership and results of operations of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems from march   ii the ownership and results of operations of the assets comprising the pacific terminals storage and distribution system for the period from july   iii the ownership and results of operations of the rangeland system for the period from may   and iv the ownership of the mapl pipeline for the period from june  each of these acquisitions closed on the date indicated 
overview we are a publicly traded partnership engaged principally in the business of gathering  transporting  storing and distributing crude oil and related products in california and the rocky mountain region of the us and in alberta  canada 
we conduct our business through two regional business segments the west coast business unit and the rocky mountain business unit 
we generate revenue primarily by charging tariff rates for transporting crude oil on our pipelines and by leasing storage capacity 
we also buy  blend and sell crude oil  activities that are complementary to our pipeline transportation business 
we are managed by our general partner  pacific energy gp  lp  which is in turn managed by its general partner  pacific energy management llc 
see recent developments below 
our west coast business unit consists of i line  ii the line system  iii the pacific terminals storage and distribution system and iv the pmt gathering and blending system 
we transport crude oil produced in california s san joaquin valley and the california outer continental shelf ocs to refineries and terminal facilities in the los angeles basin and in bakersfield 
in addition  we own and operate storage and distribution assets servicing the los angeles basin 
our west coast business unit also buys  blends and sells crude oil  in large measure as a means of generating additional volumes on our pipelines 
we are developing a deepwater petroleum import terminal at pier and terminal island in the port of los angeles pola 
our rocky mountain business unit consists of i certain undivided interest in the western corridor system  ii the salt lake city core system  iii rpl s interest in frontier pipeline company  and iv beginning in may  the rangeland system 
in june  we acquired the mid alberta pipeline the mapl pipeline and integrated it with rangeland 
we are transforming rangeland from being primarily a gathering pipeline  serving conventional production areas in central and southern alberta  into a main line transporting system with access in edmonton  alberta  to the growing synthetic oil production as well as the existing conventional oil production of alberta 
the combination of the rangeland and mapl assets with our existing rocky mountain business unit allows us to transport crude oil produced in canada and the us rocky mountain region to refineries in montana  wyoming  colorado and utah  either directly through our pipelines or indirectly through connections with third party pipelines 
cash distributions our principal business objective is to generate stable and increasing cash flows by being a leading provider of pipeline transportation and other midstream services to the north american energy industry 
we seek to achieve our objective by executing the following strategies use our strategic position in our core market areas to maximize throughput on our pipelines and utilization of our storage facilities 
control our operating and capital costs while maintaining the safety and operational integrity of our assets 
pursue strategic and accretive acquisitions and new projects that enhance and expand our core business 
minimize our exposure to commodity price volatility 
our ability to execute this acquisition and development strategy successfully is dependent on the price we pay for the acquisitions or the cost of development relative to the future cash flows the new assets generate 
our cash distributions to unitholders may vary over time with the cash flow from our operating activities 
our operating cash flow is impacted by the revenue and cost variables described below 
our cash distributions may also vary over time with the level of sustaining capital expenditures 
these expenditures are required to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity or efficiency of our assets and extend their useful lives 
during the subordination period  the common units are entitled to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of per unit  plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters  to the extent we have sufficient cash from our operations after payment of fees and expenses  including payments to our general partner and establishment of cash reserves  before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units 
the existence of the subordinated units increases the likelihood that during the subordination period there will be available cash to distribute the minimum quarterly distribution to the holders of the common units 
see item market price of and distributions on the registrant s common equity and related unitholder matters regarding subordinated units and the subordination period 
recent developments sale of the anschutz corporation s interest in the partnership on march   the anschutz corporation completed the sale of its interest in us to lb pacific  lp lbp  an entity formed by lehman brothers merchant banking group lbmb 
the acquisition by lbp the lb acquisition included the purchase of a ownership interest in pacific energy gp  inc predecessor of pacific energy gp  lp  which owned i a general partner interest in us and the incentive distribution rights  and ii  subordinated units of the partnership representing a limited partner interest in us 
immediately prior to the closing of the lb acquisition  pacific energy gp  inc was converted to pacific energy gp  llc  a delaware limited liability company  and immediately after the closing of the lb acquisition  pacific energy gp  llc was converted to pacific energy gp  lp  a delaware limited partnership 
the general partner of pacific energy gp  lp is pacific energy management llc  a delaware limited liability company  which is owned by lbp 
immediately following the closing of the lb acquisition  our general partner distributed the  subordinated units of the partnership to lbp 
in connection with the conversion of our general partner to a limited partnership  our general partner ceased to have a board of directors  and is now managed by its general partner  pacific energy management llc  a delaware limited liability company pem  which is owned by lbp 
pem has a board of directors the board of directors or board that manages the business and affairs of pem and  thus  indirectly manages the business and affairs of our general partner and the partnership 
the board of directors is comprised of six of the directors who served on the board of directors of our general partner prior to the lb acquisition  together with four directors appointed by lbp 
for further discussion of the board of directors  see item directors and executive officers 
all of the officers and employees of our general partner were transferred to fill the same positions with pem  and the board established the same committees as had been maintained by our general partner prior to the lb acquisition 
pem also adopted our general partner s compensation structure and its employee benefits plans and policies 
canadian acquisitions rangeland system acquisition 
on may   we completed the acquisition of the rangeland system from bp canada energy company bp 
the rangeland system is located in alberta  canada 
the purchase price for the rangeland system was cdn million plus approximately cdn million for linefill  working capital and transaction costs for an aggregate purchase price of us million 
the purchase was funded through a combination of proceeds from our march equity offering and a cdn million borrowing from a new cdn revolving credit facility in canada 
mapl pipeline acquisition 
on june   we completed the acquisition of the mapl pipeline  located in alberta  canada  from imperial oil 
the purchase price for the mapl pipeline was cdn million  of which cdn million is payable on june  in addition  we acquired linefill for cdn million 
the aggregate purchase price  including assumed liabilities  linefill and transaction costs  was approximately us million  most of which was funded from our canadian credit facility 
integration and transition 
the rangeland system and the mapl pipeline have each historically been operated on a proprietary basis 
we have integrated the mapl pipeline into the rangeland system 
we are making significant changes to the revenue generating capability of these assets by combining and integrating fully all of our canadian and us rocky mountain pipeline assets under common management  by expanding the throughput capacity of the rangeland system by establishing connections with other pipelines  and by constructing a pump station and receiving terminal in edmonton  alberta 
this new pump station and receiving terminal will be able to access multiple sources of canadian crude oil  which will allow us to participate in the projected increase in production of synthetic crude oil 
the construction of the new connections on the rangeland system and the new pump station and receiving terminal is expected to cost approximately cdn million  and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of pier in february  we completed an initial feasibility study for the development of a deepwater petroleum import terminal at pier and terminal island in the port of los angeles pola to handle marine receipts of crude oil and refinery feedstocks 
we are developing the pier terminal to participate in the marine import business  which is growing as a result of a decline in imports from alaska and the local production decline 
the pacific terminals storage and distribution assets also benefit by the increase in the marine import business 
we initiated the environmental review and permitting for the pier project in june and expect to have the permits necessary for construction to begin by early we entered into a project development agreement with two subsidiaries of valero energy corporation valero that defines the facilities that we are to construct in the pola 
we and valero have also signed a terminaling services agreement with a year   bpd volume commitment from valero to support the terminal 
these agreements are subject to the satisfaction of various conditions 
if the pier terminal receives the necessary governmental approvals and is successfully developed  a deepwater berth  high capacity transfer infrastructure and storage tanks will be constructed at pier and terminal island in the pola and a pipeline distribution system will be constructed to connect the terminal s storage tanks to valero s wilmington refinery and to our customers facilities in the los angeles basin through our pacific terminals storage and distribution system 
we would construct the transfer infrastructure  including a large diameter pipeline system for receiving bulk petroleum liquids from marine vessels  and the storage tanks 
final construction of the pier project is subject to the completion of a land lease agreement with the pola  receipt of environmental and other approval  securing additional customer commitments  updating engineering and project cost estimates  ongoing feasibility evaluation  and financing 
a final decision to proceed is expected to be made in the fourth quarter of we expect construction of the pier terminal to be completed and placed in service in we capitalized approximately million on the pier project in and million in these expenditures include million for emission reduction credits  an asset that is re saleable if the project does not proceed 
we anticipate funding pre construction costs through late from a portion of the proceeds from our march equity offering 
construction of the pier terminal is expected to be financed through a combination of debt and proceeds from the issuance of additional partnership units  including common units 
salt lake city expansion project we also recently expanded our pipelines serving salt lake city by establishing a new delivery connection from frontier pipeline to the salt lake city core system at a cost of approximately million 
existing pipelines into salt lake city were previously prorated  or limited by capacity  during the summer season 
this connection increases delivery capacity to salt lake city refineries by approximately  bpd 
equity and debt offerings on march   we issued and sold  common units in an underwritten public offering at a price of per common unit before underwriting fees and offering expenses 
on april   the underwriters exercised a portion of the over allotment option and purchased an additional  common units to cover over allotments at a price of per common unit before underwriting fees and offering expenses 
net proceeds received from the offering  including our general partner s contribution of million  totaled approximately million after deducting underwriting fees and offering expenses 
we used million of the net proceeds to finance the acquisition of the rangeland system and the balance of the net proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under our us revolving credit facility 
on june   we completed the sale of million of senior notes due in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and to non us persons under regulation s of the securities act 
the senior notes were issued at a discount of million  resulting in an effective interest rate of 
net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were million after deducting the million discount and offering expenses of million 
the net proceeds were used principally to repay our million term loan and to repay million of indebtedness outstanding under our us revolving credit facility 
on september   we filed a registration statement on form s to register the senior notes 
on september   we commenced an exchange offer  which allowed the holders of the unregistered senior notes to exchange the senior notes for new notes with materially identical terms that had been registered under the securities act 
the exchange offer expired on october   and all of the unregistered senior notes were exchanged for registered senior notes 
the senior notes are not listed on any securities exchange 
in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of million to receive interest at a fixed rate of and to pay interest at an average variable rate of six month libor plus set in advance or in arrears depending on the swap transaction 
the net impact on our interest expense of the notes offering  the related interest rate swap and the term loan repayment is that we expect our interest expense to remain largely unchanged 
business fundamentals pipeline transportation we generate pipeline transportation revenue by charging tariff rates for transporting crude oil on our common carrier pipelines 
the fundamental items impacting our pipeline transportation revenue are the volume of crude oil  or throughput  we transport on our pipelines and our tariff rates 
throughput on our pipelines fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil available for transport on our pipelines  the demand for refined products  refinery downtime and the availability of alternate sources of crude oil for the refineries we serve 
our shippers determine the amount of crude oil we transport on our pipelines  but we influence these volumes through the level and type of service we provide and the rates we charge 
our rates need to be competitive to transportation alternatives  which are mostly other pipelines 
the availability of crude oil for transportation on our pipelines is dependent in part on the amount of drilling and enhanced recovery activity in the production fields we serve in our west coast operations and in parts of our rocky mountain operations 
with the passage of time  production of crude oil in an individual well naturally declines  which can in the short term be offset in whole or in part by additional drilling or the implementation of recovery enhancement measures 
in the san joaquin valley and in the california ocs  total production is generally declining 
in the third quarter of  producers began the development of the rocky point field in the california ocs with the drilling of the first of eight planned wells 
the first well began production at the end of the third quarter of  thereby increasing the supply of crude oil available to be transported by us into the los angeles basin 
we anticipate that a significant portion of any incremental ocs production will be transported on our pipelines 
shell oil company recently announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its bakersfield refinery 
shell had previously intended to close the refinery 
while we would benefit from a closure of the shell refinery  we are also positioned to benefit from its sale to a third party and its continued operation through our delivery of additional volumes of crude oil to the refinery and from the deliveries of partially refined feedstocks from the refinery south to the los angeles basin 
in the rocky mountains  our pipelines are connected to canadian sources of crude oil  and in we completed the acquisitions of pipeline systems giving us greater access to significant supplies of canadian crude oil  including synthetic crude oil  which we believe will replace any us rocky mountain production decline and meet growing demand in the us rocky mountain region 
the tariff rates we charge on line and the line system are regulated by the california public utilities commission the cpuc 
tariffs on line are established based on market considerations  subject to certain contractual limitations 
tariffs on line  which are cost of service based tariffs  are based upon the costs to operate and maintain the pipeline  as well as charges for the depreciation of the capital investment in the pipeline and the authorized rate of return 
the tariff rates charged on our us rocky mountain pipelines are regulated by either the ferc or the wyoming public service commission  generally under a cost of service approach 
in canada  the rangeland system is operated as a propriety pipeline system  not subject to rate regulation 
on may   we increased the tariff rates on line by approximately  based on a contractually agreed index of cost changes 
this index is reviewed annually 
effective november   we increased the tariff rates on our line system by 
this increase was the first for line since these tariff increases mitigate the impact of declining throughput 
storage and distribution we provide storage and distribution services to refineries in the los angeles basin 
the fundamental items impacting our storage and distribution revenue are the amount of storage capacity we have under lease  the lease rates for that capacity and the length of each lease 
demand for crude oil storage capacity tends to be more stable over time and leases for crude oil storage capacity are usually long term more than one year 
demand for storage capacity for other dark products is less stable than for crude oil storage and varies depending on  among other things  refinery production runs and maintenance activities 
leases for dark products storage capacity are usually short term less that one year 
one of our business goals is to convert a number of dark products tanks to more flexible crude oil service which can also accommodate other dark products  we currently await permit approvals for one such tank conversion and plan to convert a second tank in while pt s rates are regulated by the cpuc  the cpuc has authorized pt to establish its rates based on market conditions through negotiated contracts 
pipeline buy sell transportation revenue throughput on our rangeland system  which was acquired in the second quarter of and which includes the rangeland and mapl pipelines  varies with many of the same factors described in pipeline transportation above 
in addition  following completion of our edmonton initiation station  scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of  throughput will vary with our success in attracting new supplies of synthetic crude oil to our system 
the rangeland system operates as a proprietary system and  therefore  we take title to the crude oil that is gathered and transported 
pursuant to a transportation service agreement between rmc and rpc  rmc controls the entire capacity of rangeland pipeline 
customers who wish to transport product on rangeland pipeline must either i sell product to rmc at the inlet to the pipeline without repurchasing product from rmc  or ii sell product to rmc at an inlet point and repurchase such product at agreed upon delivery points for the price paid at the inlet to the pipeline plus an established location differential 
substantially all of the pipelines that comprise the rangeland system are subject to the jurisdiction of the alberta energy utilities board eub 
the canadian portion of the segment of the rangeland system owned by apc that connects to the western corridor system at the us canadian border is subject to the canadian national energy board neb 
neither the eub nor the neb will generally review rates set by a crude oil pipeline operator unless it receives a complaint 
effective december   we increased the location differentials on the rangeland pipeline 
gathering and blending we purchase  gather  blend and resell crude oil in our pmt operations 
our pmt gathering and blending system in california s san joaquin valley is a proprietary intrastate operation that is not regulated by the cpuc or the ferc 
it is complementary to our west coast pipeline transportation business 
the gathering network effectively extends our pipeline network to capture additional supplies of crude oil for transportation on our trunk pipelines to los angeles 
the contribution of our pmt gathering and blending operations is  for several reasons  a variable part of our income 
first  it varies with the price differential between the cost of the varying grades of crude oil and natural gasoline pmt buys for use in its blending operations and the price of the blended crude oil it sells 
costs and sales prices are impacted by crude oil prices generally  as well as by local supply and demand forces  including regulations affecting refined product specifications 
second  it varies with the price differential between crude oil purchased on one price basis and sold on a different price basis 
finally  it varies with the volumes gathered and blended 
we seek to control these variations through our risk management policy  which provides specific guidelines for our crude oil marketing and hedging activities and requires oversight by our senior management 
our blending margins are a function of the cost of the heavy and light crude oils and natural gasoline that we buy and blend  relative to the price of the blended crude oil we sell 
blending margins exceeded their historical averages in the first eight months of  however  since september  blending margins have been below their historical averages 
foreign imports of crude oil into the los angeles basin were highly discounted relative to west texas intermediate wti prices  which reduced demand for and prices of local california crude oil  including crude oil gathered and blended by us in the san joaquin valley 
as the demand for and price of our blended crude oil has fallen  we have taken action to cancel certain purchase contracts beginning in the fourth quarter  and to reduce the volume we gather  blend and sell 
in addition  margins on one particular contract declined as the difference between purchases made on a wti price basis and sales made on a west coast price basis deviated from historical norms 
this situation is expected to continue through this contract s maturity at the end of the first quarter of acquisitions and new projects we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions and new projects for development of additional midstream assets  including pipeline  storage and terminal facilities 
we also intend to expand  principally by acquisition  into the refined product and natural gas storage and transportation businesses 
we expect the acquisitions and new projects will be accretive to our cash flow and complement our existing business 
we expect to fund acquisitions and new projects with a combination of debt and additional partnership units  including common units 
we expect to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately percent over time 
operating expenses a substantial portion of the operating expenses we incur  including the cost of field and support personnel  maintenance  control systems  telecommunications  rights of way and insurance  varies little with changes in throughput 
certain of our costs  however  do vary with throughput  the most material being the cost of power used to run pump stations along our pipelines 
major maintenance costs can vary depending on a particular asset s age and also with regulatory requirements  such as mandatory inspections at defined intervals 
unanticipated costs can include the costs of cleanup of any release of oil to the extent not covered by insurance 
employees we do not have any employees  except in canada 
our general partner provides employees to conduct our us operations 
we and our general partner collectively employ approximately individuals who directly support our operations 
we consider employee relations to be good 
none of these employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
our general partner does not conduct any business other than with respect to the partnership 
all expenses incurred by our general partner are charged to us 
impact of foreign exchange rates assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period 
revenues  expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
the reported cash flow of our canadian operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in canadian dollars 
the results of our canadian operations and distributions from our canadian subsidiaries to the partnership may vary in us dollar terms based on fluctuations in currency exchange rates irrespective of our canadian subsidiaries underlying operating results 
in addition  the amount of monies we repatriate from canada will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates and may impact the cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
such estimates and judgments are evaluated and modified as necessary on an ongoing basis 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note  significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements and estimates  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity we routinely apply the provisions of purchase accounting when recording our acquisitions 
application of purchase accounting requires that we estimate the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the valuation of the fair value of the assets involves a number of judgments and estimates 
in our major acquisitions to date  we have engaged an outside valuation firm to provide us with an appraisal report  which we utilized in determining the purchase price allocation 
the allocation of the purchase price to different asset classes impacts the depreciation expense we subsequently record 
the principal assets we have acquired to date are property  pipelines  storage tanks and equipment 
we depreciate the components of our property and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated 
when necessary  the assets useful lives are revised and the impact on depreciation is treated on a prospective basis 
we accrue an estimate of the undiscounted costs of environmental remediation for work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated it is probable that cleanup costs are or will be required and may be reasonably estimated 
in making these estimates  we consider information that is currently available  existing technology  enacted laws and regulations  and our estimates of the timing of the required remedial actions 
we use outside environmental consultants to assist us in making these estimates 
in addition  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america require us to establish liabilities for the costs of asset retirement obligations when the retirement date is determinable 
we will record such liabilities only when such date is determinable 
from time to time  a shipper or group of shippers may initiate a regulatory proceeding or other action challenging the tariffs we charge or have charged 
in such cases  we assess the proceeding on an ongoing basis as to its likely outcome in order to determine whether to accrue for a future expense 
we use outside regulatory lawyers and financial experts to assist us in these assessments 
our inventory of crude oil for our pmt gathering and blending operations  our canadian operations and any inventory earned through our tariffs for the transportation of crude oil in our common carrier pipelines is carried in our accounts at the lower of cost or market value 
any significant quantity of inventory is hedged 
on any unhedged portion  we are exposed to the potential for a write down to market value 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary net income for the year ended december  was million or per diluted limited partner unit compared to million or per diluted limited partner unit for the year ended december  net income includes the operations of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system following its acquisition on july  and the operations of the rangeland system after its acquisition on may  and its expansion by acquisition of the mapl pipeline on june  internally  in our analysis of operating results  we consider the impact of unusual items that we believe affect comparability between periods 
we also believe that providing a discussion and analysis of our results that is comparable year over year  provides a more accurate and thorough analysis of our results of operations 
following is a discussion of each of the unusual items that impacted the results of our operations 
share of frontier s rate case and litigation expense 
in  frontier incurred an expense for a contract dispute and two tariff rate related matters 
these matters related to early and prior years  so there is no impact on frontier s current rates or revenues 
write down of idle property 
in  we recorded an million write down of idle property associated with the pending sale of an idle pacific terminals property 
write off of deferred financing cost and interest rate swap termination expense 
in  we recorded an expense related to the unamortized portion of deferred financing costs of million for a term loan which was repaid in and incurred million of expense to terminate related interest rate swaps 
the following table is a summary that shows our net income adjusted for the items mentioned above year ended december  change percent in thousands  except per unit information net income    add share of frontier s rate case and litigation expense  write down of idle property write off of deferred financing cost and interest rate swap termination expense  the increase in net income  adjusted for the unusual items mentioned above  reflects the benefit of i the operations  since july  of pacific terminals storage and distribution system  ii higher volumes and revenue on the rocky mountain pipelines  and iii the operations of the rangeland system acquired in may these increases were partially offset by lower volumes and revenue from the west coast pipelines and lower gathering and blending margins 
there were approximately more limited partner units outstanding in the twelve months ended december  due to the sale of additional common units to partially fund the acquisitions of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system  the rangeland system and the mapl pipeline 
segment information year ended december  west coast change percent in thousands operating income    operating data pipeline throughput bpd for the year ended december   operating income was million  after the million impairment expense  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a full year benefit of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system  which was acquired on july  pmt experienced lower gathering and blending margins in the third and fourth quarters of  as well as reduced demand for pmt s blended crude 
we consider this gathering and blending activity to be complementary to our pipeline transportation operations 
pipeline volumes for the year ended december  were lower than in the year ended  primarily due to ocs production declines  as well as increased crude runs by bakersfield refineries  which reduced the volumes available to move south to los angeles 
helping to offset lower volumes were increased tariff rates on line in may and line in november  and a more favorable tariff mix 
year ended december  rocky mountains change percent in thousands operating income    operating data bpd rangeland pipeline system sundre north sundre south western corridor system salt lake city core system frontier pipeline for the year ended december   operating income was million compared to million for the year ended december  the rangeland system was acquired in the second quarter of in addition  strengthened demand at billings  montana refineries in the latter half of the year  as well as increased demand by the salt lake city  utah  refineries  helped drive higher pipeline volumes on all us rocky mountain systems 
the  bpd expansion completed in the second quarter of further increased volumes into salt lake city 
we are currently evaluating a second expansion phase into salt lake city to meet increasing demand

this increase was partially offset by lower west coast pipeline revenues due to natural field production decline  and increased crude runs by bakersfield refineries which reduced the volumes available to move south to los angeles 
helping to offset lower california volumes were increased tariffs and a more favorable tariff mix 
higher storage and distribution revenue in reflects a full year of operations of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system  which was acquired on july  in addition  capacity was expanded  utilization rates increased and storage rates per barrel were also higher 
pipeline buy sell transportation revenues of million relate to the operations of the rangeland system  which was acquired on may  the decrease in net crude oil sales for was primarily the result of lower margin blending activities in our west coast operations  particularly due to lower blending volumes as a result of a change in refined products specifications and competitive pricing pressures as a result of cheaper foreign crude entering the west coast markets 
higher oil prices increased gross sales and purchases values 
we consider this gathering and blending activity to be complementary to our pipeline transportation operations 
year ended december  expenses change percent in thousands operating expenses    transition costs general and administrative expense    depreciation and amortization    the increase in operating expense was related primarily to the acquisition of the pacific terminals storage and distribution assets on july  and the rangeland system on may  we also experienced higher operating costs in the rocky mountains for maintenance and power costs  as well as the use of a flow improvement agent that increases throughput 
transition costs in consisted of employee transition bonus payments related to our purchase of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems in transition costs in were incurred for transition services provided by the sellers of the rangeland system and the mapl pipeline  as well as for consulting and other out of pocket costs incurred in connection with the integration effort 
the increase in general and administrative expense was in part due to the acquisition of the rangeland system in may  increased costs for regulatory compliance and increased personnel costs related to company growth 
the increase in depreciation and amortization includes million for depreciation on the pacific terminals storage and distribution system  reflecting a full year in  and million for depreciation on the rangeland system 
these increases were partly offset by lower depreciation on other assets that have now been fully depreciated

in  we incurred an expense for a contract dispute and two tariff rate related matters 
these matters related to early and prior years  so there is no impact on frontier s current rates or revenues 
the million write down of idle property in is a non cash impairment expense associated with the pending sale of an idle pacific terminals property 
the increase in interest expense was due to borrowings incurred to partially fund the acquisition of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system and the rangeland system 
our weighted average borrowings during the twelve months ended december  were million compared to million in the corresponding period in the effect of this increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with a renegotiation of interest rates in december under our credit facilities as well as lower floating interest rates 
the combination of lower renegotiated interest rates and lower market rates led to a lower weighted average interest rate of for compared to a weighted average interest rate of in other income of million in was million greater than in due to increased rental income from surplus facility space and a foreign currency gain 
write off of deferred financing cost and interest rate swap termination expense relate to the unamortized portion of deferred financing costs of million for a term loan that was repaid in and million of expense incurred to terminate related interest rate swaps

year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary year ended december  change percent in thousands net income    basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit for was and per limited partner unit  respectively 
we completed our initial public offering in july  so there is no directly comparable per unit calculation for net income for includes five months of operations of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system following the acquisition of these assets on july  net income for includes the results of the western corridor and salt lake city core system assets for the ten months following the acquisition of these assets on march  the additional income generated by the pacific terminals storage and distribution system assets and the western corridor and salt lake city core systems was more than offset by a combination of lower west coast pipeline volumes and increased expenses 
the increased expenses include increased general and administrative expense associated with our growth and becoming a public company in july  and increased interest expense associated with our post ipo capital structure 
segment information year ended december  west coast change percent in thousands operating income    operating data pipeline throughput bpd the increase in west coast operating income was primarily due to the acquisition of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in pipeline transportation revenue as average daily pipeline throughput decreased to  bpd for the year ended december   compared to  bpd for the prior year 
california ocs throughput to the los angeles basin was lower during  compared to  primarily due to maintenance downtime at both on shore processing and off shore production facilities 
refinery maintenance activities and increased mid barrel crude oil mbco demand in san francisco reduced throughput to the los angeles basin 
increased demand for light crude oil at refineries in bakersfield also reduced throughput to the los angeles basin 
in addition  the natural decline of ocs and san joaquin valley production reduced available crude supplies 
year ended december  rocky mountains change percent in thousands operating income   operating data bpd western corridor system salt lake city core system frontier pipeline operating income for the period included only ten months of results for the western corridor and salt lake city core systems 
we incurred significant transition costs in the period  but those costs did not recur in the period 
the reduction in transition costs in was offset  however  by increased maintenance expense 
refinery maintenance in the first half of resulted in reduced throughput to salt lake city through our various pipeline systems 
statement of income discussion and analysis year ended december  revenues change percent in thousands pipeline transportation revenue    storage and distribution revenue   crude oil sales  net of purchases crude oil sales    crude oil purchases    crude oil sales  net of purchases   net revenue before operating expenses    rocky mountain pipeline transportation revenue increased by million compared to the corresponding period in due to revenue generated by the western corridor and salt lake city core systems for twelve months in compared to ten months in the increase in rocky mountain pipeline transportation revenue for was more than offset by a decrease in west coast pipeline transportation revenue due to lower throughput 
the acquisition of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system on july   resulted in storage and distribution revenue of million for the period ended december  the increase in crude oil sales and purchases for was primarily the result of higher crude oil prices 
we consider this activity to be complementary to our pipeline transportation operations 
year ended december  expenses change percent in thousands operating expenses    transition costs   general and administrative expense    depreciation and amortization    the increase in operating expense was related primarily to the acquisitions of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system and a full year of operations of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems 
we also experienced higher operating costs as a result of increased requirements for pipeline and storage tank inspections  and increased costs for property taxes and insurance 
operating expense for our rocky mountain business unit increased by million due to a full year of operations of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems compared to ten months of operations for the corresponding period in and a return to a normal level of maintenance activity 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of million in transition costs 
operating expense for our west coast operations increased by million as a result of incurring five months of operating expense relating to the pacific terminals storage and distribution system 
this was partially offset by decreased operating expense for our west coast pipeline and gathering and blending operations due to lower field operating expenses and reduced right of way expense resulting from the relinquishment of certain unused rights of way on line transition costs in consisted only of employee transition bonus payments  whereas transition costs in consisted of payments to the seller of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems for certain interim operations support  financial systems services and employee transition bonuses 
the increase in general and administrative expense includes million of expense for long term incentive awards 
the balance of the increase is attributable to additional costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems and higher costs of being a public company  including costs incurred as a result of new stock exchange and sec rules 
the increase in depreciation and amortization includes million for a full year of depreciation on the western corridor and salt lake city core systems in  compared to ten months in  and million for five months of depreciation on the pacific terminals storage and distribution system 
year ended december  other income and expenses change percent in thousands share of net income loss of frontier income before rate case and litigation expense   rate case and litigation expense   interest expense    our decreased share of frontier net income was attributable to expenses related to a contract dispute and two tariff rate related matters 
tariff revenue per barrel was greater in the first quarter of than in the subsequent periods 
interest expense increased by million  including million attributable to an increase in borrowings during the period to finance the acquisition of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system 
the remaining increase was primarily due to an increase in the interest rate on outstanding borrowings during our interest rate on outstanding borrowings averaged for  as compared to during  reflecting an increase in the percentage of fixed rate debt in our post initial public offering capital structure 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash generated from operations  together with our cash balance and our unutilized borrowing capacity  will be sufficient to meet our planned distributions  our working capital requirements and anticipated sustaining capital expenditures in the next three years 
we expect to extend or replace our revolving credit facilities  which mature in mid the financing plan for the construction of our proposed pier project will likely include both proceeds from debt and the issuance of additional partnership units 
the final structure will depend on market conditions 
on august   the partnership  peg and certain subsidiaries of peg filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the sec to register the issuance and sale  from time to time and in such amounts as determined by the market conditions and needs of the partnership  of up to million of common units of the partnership and debt securities of both the partnership and peg 
the sec declared the registration statement effective on august  at december   we have approximately million of remaining availability under this registration statement 
we intend to draw down on this shelf registration statement  file additional registration statements and use proceeds from borrowings under our existing and planned revolving credit facilities to finance our future acquisitions and development projects  including our pier project 
we expect to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately over time 
we have filed an application with the cpuc to sell surplus pacific terminals properties  which we believe are worth approximately million 
our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations  fund planned capital expenditures  make acquisitions  develop projects and pay distributions to our unitholders will depend upon our future operating performance 
our operating performance is primarily dependent on the volume of crude oil transported through our pipelines and the capacity leased in our storage tanks as described in overview above 
our operating performance is also affected by prevailing economic conditions in the crude oil industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  which could significantly impact future results 
operating  investing and financing activities year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    net cash provided by operating activities net cash from operations was higher in than  primarily because of a full year s operation of our pacific terminals storage and distribution system and the purchase of the rangeland system  which contributed to higher operating income 
in addition  we experienced higher volumes and revenue on our us rocky mountain pipelines 
these increases were partially offset by lower volumes and revenue from the west coast pipelines and lower gathering and blending margins 
net cash from operating activities in was reduced by approximately million for working capital purposes 
the decrease in the net cash from operating activities from to of million  or  was the net result of higher operating income  offset by increased interest expense relating to our post initial public offering capital structure  and an increase in cash used for working capital

impact of inflation inflation in the united states and canada has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   or environmental matters our transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation under federal  state and local environmental laws concerning  among other things  the generation  handling  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials  and we may be  from time to time  subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions 
the accompanying balance sheet includes reserves for environmental costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations 
estimates of ultimate liabilities associated with environmental costs are particularly difficult to make with certainty due to the number of variables involved  including the early stage of investigation at certain sites  the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation at most locations  the number of remediation alternatives available  the uncertainty of potential recoveries from third parties and the evolving nature of environmental laws and regulations 
based on the information presently available  it is the opinion of management that our environmental costs  to the extent they exceed recorded liabilities  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and crude oil price risk 
debt we incur under our credit facilities bears variable interest at either the applicable base or prime rate  a rate based on libor or a rate based on canadian bankers acceptances 
we have used and will continue to use from time to time derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates 
in addition  we have entered into swap agreements to convert a portion of our fixed rate senior notes into floating rate debt based on libor 
we use  on a limited basis  certain derivative instruments principally futures and options to hedge our exposure to market price volatility related to our inventory or future sales of crude oil 
we do not enter into speculative derivative activities of any kind 
the fair market values of derivative instruments are included in other assets  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in our pmt operations we purchase crude oil for subsequent blending  transportation and resale primarily in the los angeles basin 
changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments related to crude oil inventory are recognized in net income 
in  and  crude oil sales  net of purchases were net of  and million in losses  respectively  reflecting changes in the fair value of pmt s derivative instruments for its marketing activities 
in addition  changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments related to the future sale of crude oil that qualify as hedges for accounting purposes are deferred and reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of partners capital  until the related revenue is recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   million relating to the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments was included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of million to receive interest at a fixed rate of and to pay interest at an average variable rate of six month libor plus set in advance or in arrears depending on the swap transaction 
the interest rate swaps mature june  and are callable at the same dates and terms as the senior notes 
we designated these swaps as a hedge of the change in the senior notes fair value attributable to changes in the six month libor interest rate 
changes in fair values of the interest rate swaps are recorded into earnings each period 
similarly  changes in the fair value of the underlying million of senior notes  which are expected to be offsetting to changes in the fair value of the interest swaps  are recorded into earnings each period 
at december  we recorded an increase of million in the fair value of interest rate swaps with an equal offsetting entry to the million of senior notes 
as of december   we measured the hedge effectiveness of this interest rate swap and noted that no gain or loss from ineffectiveness was required to be recognized 
we are subject to risks resulting from interest rate fluctuations as the interest cost on our credit facilities and the million interest swap on the senior notes are based on variable rates 
if the libor or canadian bankers acceptance discount rates were to increase in as compared to the rate at december   our interest expense for would increase million based on our outstanding debt at december  fair value of financial instruments the carrying amount and fair values of financial instruments are as follows december  carrying value fair value carrying value fair value in thousands crude oil hedging futures fair value interest rate swaps   cash flow interest rate swaps   long term debt     as of december  and  the carrying amounts of items comprising current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short term maturities of these instruments 
the carrying amounts of the revolving credit facilities approximate fair value primarily because the interest rates fluctuate with prevailing market rates 
the interest rate on the senior notes is fixed and the fair value is determined from a broker s price quote at december  the carrying amount of derivative financial instruments represents the fair value as these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value under sfas the partnership s fair values of crude oil hedging futures are based on reuters quoted market prices on the nymex 
interest rate swaps fair values are based on the prevailing market price at which the positions could be liquidated
