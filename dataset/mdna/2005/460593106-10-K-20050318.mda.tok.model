item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
enterprise private network initiatives in the enterprise network segment  interphase will invest product development resources into product additions to the existing security acceleration product line 
these security modules are designed to work as co processor resources for servers required to perform compute intensive security encryption and decryption functions 
use of these security modules offloads host central processing units cpus of encryption decryption processing burdens and therefore improves overall system performance 
based upon interest from customers in the currently available ns and ns security products  new additions to this line are expected to offer customers even greater throughput by way of a newer  more powerful co processor chipset 
new generations of these products will be announced in early additionally  interphase has enhanced its slotoptimizer product line  a portfolio of products that enable maximized port density  enabling oems and enterprises alike to consolidate multiple network interfaces on to a single slot 
the end result is conservative usage of system slots for network i o and real estate preservation within the server chassis 
the slotoptimizer line will be expanded to include pmc architectures 
with the addition of a variety of new pmc based designs in and early  maximized slot density solutions were brought to market for use with a broader set of system architectures  including compactpci  versamodule eurocard vme  and proprietary systems 
this move is intended to broaden the list of suitable applications for the slotoptimizer line to include carrier grade and military uses in addition to a wide variety of enterprise networking applications 
telecom segment initiatives interphase continues to build on its existing portfolio of telecom solutions by diversifying into an even broader set of capabilities 
the company continues to target three main carrier segments via oem 
table of contents channels with the greatest opportunity for intelligent communications solutions including wireless  convergence next generation public network equipment  and broadband network telephony access 
expansion of the ispan and inav lines will continue in several ways  described below 
migration to pre integrated frameworks 
interphase has evolved from offering passive line interface modules to intelligent communications controllers in the last few years 
in keeping with the same initiative  interphase has made several pre integrated frameworks available to customers 
these solutions are generally a combination of multiple hardware and software modules which enable customers to spend less time and development resources for integrating their blade level subsystems 
this affords oems a better focus on their true core competencies ie applications development  faster time to market  and a reduction in development costs 
more of these frameworks  using a combination of interphase products and partner components  are expected to become available in the coming year 
advancedtca 
the widely accepted telecom platform form factor  compactpci  is beginning to reach a performance peak  and neps and carriers alike are developing applications that are expected to outgrow the architecture 
vendors seeking to provide solutions with greater bandwidth  processing and board density  cooling abilities  and memory to meet the needs of next generation applications have initiated a new technology standard 
governed by the picmg standards body  the picmg subcommittee has standardized the advanced telecom computing architecture advancedtca or atca specification 
interphase is an active participant in this standards group  and it has developed two advancedtca products to date with numerous products in development 
in keeping with the blade mezzanine solution strategy  interphase is additionally developing atca compliant ptmc cards as well as a new generation of atca specific mezzanine cards known as advancedmcs or amcs 
this new architecture has already begun acceptance by network oems  and full production units are expected to slowly replace compactpci systems in the next two to three years 
appliances 
interphase has maintained a specialty in interworking multiple protocols and gateway on a card technologies for several years and has begun to expand its product line upon this concept 
the company s interworking solutions based on a single card as opposed to previous methods requiring the use of multiple boards have paved the way for compact  specialized appliances for bridging multiple protocols and routing communications traffic 
the first product in this line of appliances  the inav multiprotocol gateway appliance  is designed for bridging atm and ethernet protocols 
based on network processors  the offers numerous advantages to the network equipment oems and carriers alike  including improved performance  a hardware based architecture a substantial improvement in reliability and development time over software based alternatives  reduced footprint  and significantly reduced cycles for applications development due to the pre development of protocol software 
protocol interworking is a widespread practice throughout the public network  because it enables carriers to migrate existing infrastructures to next generation technologies without forklift upgrades 
convergence of voice and video is a common theme today and interphase appliances provide a higher performing  more cost effective solution in specific convergence applications requiring simple protocol conversions 
building on this gateway solution  interphase is developing enhanced specialty appliances for ip routing in broadband access environments where video services are being deployed to the end user 
could be an exciting year for interphase appliances as the telecom carrier video market is in its infancy and projected to be very large 

table of contents industry standards participation the company has been engaged in the development of new products and the refinement of its existing products since its inception 
throughout its history  interphase has been active in the formulation of industry standards sanctioned by groups such as picmg and the advancedtca subcommittee in particular  ieee  ansi  vme international trade association vita  fast ethernet alliance  scsi committee  the laddis group  onc nfs consortium  and storage networking interoperability association snia  and fc open fibre channel consortium 
throughout and into  interphase has been and continues to be a very active member of the picmg standards body particularly for advancedtca 
additionally  the amc mezzanine subcommittee will be hosting a variety of industry interoperability plugfests that interphase will be heavily engaged in 
marketing and customers the company s products are sold to network equipment oems for inclusion in embedded systems designed for use in carrier networks and enterprise data networks 
these purchasers incorporate the company s products into proprietary or standards based systems for resale to either telecom carriers directly  or in cases of enterprise equipment  to distributors  system integrators or value added resellers vars  which may add specially designed software prior to resale to the enterprise end users 
also  the company sells products directly to sophisticated end users such as the military

during  sales to lucent technologies and hewlett packard accounted for million or and million or of the company s consolidated revenues  respectively 
during  sales to hewlett packard and lucent technologies accounted for million or and million or of the company s consolidated revenues  respectively 
no other customers accounted for more than of the company s consolidated revenues in the periods presented 
the company markets its products through its direct sales force  manufacturers representatives and value added distribution partners 
in addition to the company s headquarters in plano  texas  the company has sales offices located in or near boca raton  florida  santa clara  california  minneapolis  minnesota  newark  new jersey  munich  germany  helsinki  finland  sydney  australia  and paris  france 
the company s direct sales force markets products directly to key customers and support manufacturer s representatives and the distribution channel 
in addition  the company has entered into distribution agreements with key national and international distribution partners located in countries in north america  asia and europe 
see note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company s geographic assets and revenues 
manufacturing and supplies manufacturing operations are currently conducted at the company s manufacturing facility located in carrollton  texas 
the company s products consist primarily of various integrated circuits  other electronic components and firmware assembled onto an internally designed printed circuit board 
the company uses internally designed applications or specific integrated circuits asic  some of which are sole sourced  on some of its products  as well as standard off the shelf items presently available from 
table of contents two or more suppliers 
historically  the company has not experienced any significant problems in maintaining an adequate supply of these parts sufficient to satisfy customer demand 
the company believes that it has good relations with its vendors 
the company generally does not manufacture products to stock finished goods inventory  as substantially all of the company s production is dedicated to specific customer purchase orders 
as a result  the company has limited requirements to maintain significant finished goods inventories 
intellectual property and patents while the company believes that its success is ultimately dependent upon the innovative skills of its personnel and its ability to anticipate technological changes  its ability to compete successfully will depend  in part  upon its ability to protect proprietary technology contained in its products 
the company does not currently hold any patents relative to its current product lines 
instead  the company relies upon a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its products 
the development of alternative  proprietary and other technologies by third parties could adversely affect the competitiveness of the company s products 
further  the laws of some countries do not provide the same degree of protection of the company s proprietary information  as do the laws of the united states 
finally  the company s adherence to industry wide technical standards and specifications may limit the company s opportunities to provide proprietary product features capable of protection 
the company is also subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
infringement claims could require the company to expend significant time and money in litigation  pay damages  develop noninfringing technology or acquire licenses to the technology  which is the subject of asserted infringement 
the company has entered into several nonexclusive software licensing agreements that allow the company to incorporate third party software into its product line thereby increasing its functionality  performance and interoperability 
employees at december   the company had full time employees  of which were engaged in manufacturing and quality assurance  in research and development  in sales  sales support  customer service and marketing and in general management and administration 
the company s success to date has been significantly dependent on the contributions of a number of its key technical and management employees 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company believes that its future success will depend in a large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
none of the company s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and there have been no work stoppages 
the company considers its relationship with its employees to be good 

table of contents competition the company s competition includes vendors specifically dedicated to the enterprise i o and telecommunication product markets 
most of the company s major oem customers have chosen to outsource the design  manufacture and software integration of certain communications controllers and protocol processing  and the recent market conditions and reduction in resources have forced some network equipment providers to utilize off the shelf products for their product design 
increased competition and commoditization of network interface technologies could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share 
risk factors potential fluctuations in period to period results interphase has experienced fluctuations in its period to period revenue and operating results in the past and may experience fluctuations in the future 
the company s sales on both an annual and a quarterly basis can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond its control 
the company may have difficulty predicting the volume and timing of orders for products  and delays in closing orders can cause the company s operating results to fall short of anticipated levels for any period 
delays by interphase s oem customers in producing products that incorporate the company s products could also cause operating results to fall short of anticipated levels 
other factors that may particularly contribute to fluctuations in the company s revenue and operating results include success in achieving design wins  the market acceptance of the oem products that incorporate the company s products  the rate of adoption of new products  competition from new technologies and other companies  and the variability of the life cycles of interphase s customers products 
because fluctuations can happen  interphase believes that comparisons of the results of its operations for preceding quarters are not necessarily predictive of future quarters and that investors should not rely on the results for any one quarter as an indication of how interphase will perform in the future 
investors should also understand that  if the company s revenue or operating results for any quarter are less than the level expected by securities analysts or the market in general  the market price for the company s common stock could immediately and significantly decline 
technological change and new product introductions the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent introduction of products based on new technologies 
as these products are introduced  the industry standards change 
additionally  the overall telecommunications and networking industry is volatile as the effects of new technologies  new standards  new products and short life cycles contribute to changes in the industry and the performance of industry participants 
the company s future revenue will depend upon the company s ability to anticipate technological change and to develop and introduce enhanced products of its own on a timely basis that comply with new industry standards 
new product introductions  or the delays thereof  could contribute to quarterly fluctuations in operating results as orders for new products commence and orders for existing products decline 
moreover  significant delays can occur between a product introduction and commencement of volume production 
a typical time period from design in of one of our products to actual production is to months 
the inability to develop and manufacture 
table of contents new products in a timely manner  the existence of reliability  quality or availability problems in its products or their component parts  or the failure to achieve market acceptance for its products could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
competition the telecommunications  signaling and networking business is extremely competitive  and the company faces competition from a number of established and emerging start up companies both public and private 
many of the company s principal competitors have established brand name recognition and market positions and have substantially greater financial resources to deploy on promotion  advertising and research and product development than the company 
in addition  as the company broadens its product offerings  it may face competition from new competitors 
companies in related markets could offer products with functionality similar or superior to that offered by the company s products 
increased competition could result in significant pricing pressures 
these pricing pressures could result in significantly lower average selling prices for the company s products 
the company may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  cost reductions or otherwise 
the company expects that competition will increase as a result of industry consolidations and alliances  as well as the emergence of new competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully with its existing or new competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
dependence on key customers while the company enjoys a very good relationship with its customers  there can be no assurance that the company s principal customers will continue to purchase products from the company at current levels 
orders from our customers are affected by factors such as new product introductions  product life cycles  inventory levels  manufacturing strategies  contract awards  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
customers typically do not enter into long term volume purchase contracts with the company  and customers have certain rights to extend or delay the shipment of their orders 
the loss of one or more of the company s major customers  or the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders or a delay in shipment of the company s products to such customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
design wins a design win occurs when a customer or prospective customer notifies the company that its product has been selected to be integrated with their product 
ordinarily  there are a number of steps between the design win and when customers initiate production shipments 
design wins reach production volumes at varying rates  typically beginning approximately to months after the design win occurs 
a variety of risks such as schedule delays  cancellations of programs and changes in customer markets can delay or prevent the design win from reaching the production phase 
the customer s failure to bring their product to the production phase could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents product liability if the company delivers products with errors  defects or problems  its credibility and the market acceptance and sales of its products could be harmed 
further  if interphase s products contain errors  defects and problems  then the company may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate such problems 
defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against interphase or against its customers 
interphase has agreed to indemnify its customers in some circumstances against liability from defects in its products 
while no such litigation currently exists  product liability litigation arising from errors  defects or problems  even if it resulted in an outcome favorable to interphase  would be time consuming and costly to defend 
existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate any limitation of liability provisions that are included in the company s license agreements 
a successful product liability claim could seriously harm the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
interphase maintains insurance coverage for product liability claims 
although management believes this coverage is adequate  it is not assured that coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover product liability claims against the company 
in addition  product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted against the company 
dependence on third party suppliers certain components used in the company s products are currently available to the company from one or a limited number of sources 
there can be no assurance that future supplies will be adequate for the company s needs or will be available on prices and terms acceptable to the company 
the company s inability in the future to obtain sufficient limited source components  or to develop alternative sources  could result in delays in product introduction or shipments  and increased component prices could negatively affect the company s gross margins  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
dependence on internal manufacturing the company manufactures its products at its carrollton  texas facility  and is currently in negotiations to establish alternative manufacturing capabilities through a third party in the event of a disaster in its current facility 
if the company is successful in establishing an alternative third party contract manufacturer  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to retain their services at the same costs that the company currently enjoys 
in the event of an interruption in production  the company may not be able to deliver products on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenue and operating results 
although the company currently has business interruption insurance and a disaster recovery plan to minimize the effect of the interruption  no assurances can be given that such insurance or recovery plan will adequately cover the company s lost business as a result of such an interruption 

table of contents dependence on proprietary technology the company s success depends partly upon certain proprietary technologies developed in its software 
to date  the company has relied principally upon trademark  copyright and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technologies 
the company generally enters into confidentiality or license agreements with its customers  distributors and potential customers and limits access to and distribution of the source code to its software and other proprietary information 
the company s employees are subject to the company s employment policy regarding confidentiality 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technologies or to provide an effective remedy in the event of a misappropriation by others 
although management believes that the company s products do not infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted  possibly resulting in costly litigation in which the company may not ultimately prevail 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of the company s proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities  require that the company seek licenses from third parties or prevent the company from manufacturing or selling its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
it may be necessary for the company to obtain technology licenses from others due to the large number of patents in the computer networking industry and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and new standards or to obtain important new technology 
there can be no assurance that these third party technology licenses will be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss of or inability to obtain any of these technology licenses could result in delays or reductions in product shipments 
such delays or reductions in product shipments could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
dependence on employees the company s success depends on the continued contributions of its personnel and on its ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
changes in personnel could adversely affect the company s operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
foreign currency the company is exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because it conducts business on a global basis and in some cases in foreign currencies 
the company s operations in france are measured in the local currency and converted into us dollars based on published exchange rates for the periods reported and are therefore subject to risk of exchange rate fluctuations see item a foreign currency risk 
the company has incurred significant losses in the past although the company posted net income of approximately million for the year ended december   the company has incurred net losses of approximately  for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december 
table of contents  as part of a broader strategic refocusing  the company developed a strategy to end of life many of its legacy products in an effort to focus its resources on its new product lines 
this strategy resulted in increased sales of legacy products in  however legacy product revenues have consistently declined since 
management does not expect significant revenues from its legacy product lines in future periods 
in order to sustain its profitability  the company will need to generate higher revenues while containing costs and operating expenses 
management cannot be certain that the company s revenues will continue to grow or that the company will achieve sufficient revenues to maintain profitability on a long term  sustained basis 
the company may need more working capital to fund operations and expand the business management believes the company s current financial resources will be sufficient to meet the present working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
however  the company may need to raise additional capital before this period ends to further fund research and development of new products beyond what is expected in  expand the company s product and service offerings beyond what is contemplated in if unforeseen opportunities arise  respond to unforeseen competitive pressures 
the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the success of the existing and new product and service offerings and potentially competing technological and market developments 
however  any projections of future cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if current cash  marketable securities  lines of credit and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy the liquidity requirements  the company may seek to sell additional equity securities  issue debt securities or increase the company s working capital line of credit 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to the company s shareholders 
from time to time  management expects to evaluate the acquisition of  or investment in businesses and technologies that complement the company 
acquisitions or investments might impact the company s liquidity requirements or cause the company to sell additional equity securities or issue debt securities 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
if adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms  the company s ability to develop or enhance products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures would be limited 
this limitation could negatively impact the results of operations  financial condition and cash flows of the company 
the market price of the company s common stock is likely to continue to be volatile the trading price of the company s common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter fluctuations in operating results  general conditions in the computer and communications industries and other events or factors 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market price of the securities of many high technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company s common stock has historically had relatively

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains forward looking statements about the business  financial condition and prospects of the company 
these statements are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the actual results of the company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties  including without limitation  our reliance on a limited number of customers  failure to see spending improvements in the telecommunications and computer networking industries  significant changes in product demand  the availability of products  changes in competition  various inventory risks due to changes in market conditions and other risks and uncertainties indicated in the company s filings and reports with the securities and exchange commission 
all the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control  and in many cases  the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements 
when used in this report  the words believes  plans  expects  intends  and anticipates and similar expressions as they relate to the company or its management are intended to identify forward looking statements 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the board of directors and audit committee 
revenue recognition revenues consist of product and service revenues and are recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
product revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided fees are fixed and determinable  a customer purchase order is obtained when applicable  and collection is probable 
revenues from reseller agreements are recognized when the product is sold through to the end customer unless an established return history supports recognizing revenue upon shipment  less a provision for estimated sales returns 
deferred revenue consists primarily of revenue from reseller arrangements  service revenue and certain arrangements with extended payment terms 
revenue from extended payment terms is recognized in the period the payment becomes due if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue derived from the development and installation of highly customized software packages under a professional services contract is recognized on a percentage of completion basis measured by the relationship of hours worked to total estimated contract hours and the costs incurred as of the date of measurement 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends upon estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 

table of contents revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition and net income  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and net income 
if estimates were to indicate that a loss would be incurred on a contract upon completion  a provision for the expected loss would be recorded in the period in which the loss became evident 
warranty reserve the company offers to its customers a limited warranty that its products will be free from defect in the materials and workmanship for a specified period 
the company has established a warranty reserve  as a component of accrued liabilities  for any potential claims 
the company estimates its warranty reserve based upon an analysis of all identified or expected claims and an estimate of the cost to resolve those claims 
changes in claim rates and differences between actual and expected warranty costs could impact the warranty reserve estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts management is required to estimate the collectibility of the company s trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
management evaluates all accounts periodically and a reserve is established based on the best facts available to management and reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
the reserves also are determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories based on historical results 
allowance for returns the company estimates its allowance for returns based upon expected return rates 
the estimates of expected return rates are generally a factor of historical returns 
changes in return rates could impact allowance for return estimates 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market involves an inherent level of risk and uncertainty due to technology trends in the industry and customer demand for our products 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  management is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserve requirements generally increase as projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
the company has experienced significant changes in required reserves in the past due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines as well as declining market conditions 
it is possible that significant changes in this estimate may continue to occur in the future as market conditions change 
long lived assets property and equipment and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable generally accepted accounting principles gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
all impairments are recognized in operating results when a permanent reduction in value occurs
