accordingly  management believes that the financial statements presented in item below which form the basis of this discussion and analysis fairly present  in all material respects  the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented 
overview rti international metals  inc conducts its operations in two segments the titanium group and the fabrication distribution group 
the titanium group  with primary operations in niles  ohio and canton  ohio  has overall responsibility for the production of primary mill products including  but not limited to  bloom  billet  sheet and plate 
this group also focuses on the research and development of evolving technologies relating to raw materials  melting and other production processes and the application of titanium in new markets 
f d  with operations located throughout the us  europe and canada and representative offices in germany  italy and china  concentrates its efforts on maximizing its profitability by offering value added products and services such as engineered tubulars and extrusions  fabricated and machine components and sub assemblies  as well as engineered systems for energy related markets  accessing the titanium group as its primary source of mill products 
approximately of the titanium group s sales in were to f d 
while of rti s sales in were directed to the commercial aerospace market  approximately of all us titanium production is shipped to this segment 
in  the world economies began to improve  air traffic demand rose significantly in the commercial aircraft segment and defense spending continued to grow  leading to a rebound from in the demand for titanium and speciality metal products 
an agreement with the united steelworkers of america uswa expired on october  at the company s niles  ohio facility where the union represents hourly and clerical workers 
after two extensions and a union rejection vote on october  a work stoppage commenced and non represented employees began operating the facility 
non represented employees operated the facility until a new month agreement was reached on december  the diversification offered by f d has allowed management to de emphasize commodity titanium products and move the company up the value chain  as well as pursue growth opportunities through acquisitions 
supply chain management is a capability that is becoming more important in f d s targeted markets and rti intends to enhance this core competency 
much of the deployed capital within rti relates to inventory  primarily work in process  necessitated by the nature of processing titanium to demanding metallurgical and physical specifications 
however  significant investments in raw materials  such as titanium sponge and master alloys  have also been made in order to insure uninterrupted supply and to accommodate surges in demand 
as a result  management has put in place various goals aimed at optimizing inventory levels  thereby freeing cash resources to be invested in other areas of the company 
in conjunction with the close monitoring of our working capital position  an emphasis is also made on capital expenditures 
it is not the intent of management to match these with depreciation expense but rather identify those opportunities that will result in the highest return to our shareholders 
over the past few years  capital outlays have been less than depreciation however  in the company acquired rti claro for the sum of million plus  shares of rti stock 
the cash position at the year end stood at million against million at as for the ultimate disposition of this cash  the rti board of directors regularly considers such options as dividends  stock repurchases in excess of an approved million program  acquisitions or strategic combinations 
given the uncertainty and competitive pressures in the current marketplace  as well as the company s growth strategy  management believes that a net cash position with no long term debt is currently the most desirable capital structure 
discontinued operations the company disclosed in a news release dated september  that its tube mill operations had stopped soliciting new orders because of a shortage of skelp  which is the key raw material in manufacturing titanium strip 
the decision to halt the solicitation of new orders was to continue until a search for other sources of skelp was concluded 
in december the company terminated its search for other skelp sources and decided to terminate production activity and discontinue the titanium strip product line and utilize the facility for other purposes unrelated to the manufacture of welded tubing 
tube mill operations had been reported within the f d segment 
discontinued operations  which represent operating results of the tube mill operations for which further information is included in note  reported trade sales of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
at december  the company impaired certain tube mill assets and provided for certain contingencies which resulted in an after tax charge of million 
this charge and the required balance sheet adjustments were reflected in the net loss from discontinued operations for the period ended december  results of operations years ended december    and dollars in millions net sales year ended december  titanium group trade inter company total fabrication and distribution group trade inter company total eliminations net sales titanium group sales for the company s titanium group amounted to million  including intercompany sales of million  in the year ended december  compared to million  including intercompany sales of million  in the same period of the increase in sales of million or an increase of was mainly due to an increase in mill product shipments of thousand pounds 
shipments in of mill products were million pounds versus the year ago period of million pounds 
the increase in shipments was due to higher levels of bloom and sheet sales from the year ago period and resulted in increased revenue of approximately million 
increased demand from the steel industry for ferro titanium and increased intercompany shipments of electrodes generated million in increased revenue 
the termination of the company s contract with the us department of energy resulted in reduced revenues of million 
sales for the company s titanium group amounted to million  including intercompany sales of million  in the year ended december  compared to million  including intercompany sales of million  in the same period of the group s net sales decreased as a result of a decrease in mill product shipments  partially offset by higher average realized prices as product mix shifted to higher value added flat rolled products 
shipments of titanium mill products were million pounds in the year ended december   compared to million pounds for the same period in averaged realized prices increased to per pound compared to the same period in of per pound 
the net effect of the reduced mill shipments offset by increased prices was million 
revenue was lower at the groups rmi environmental services business based as a result of reduced remediation activity by million 
fabrication and distribution group sales in f d amounted to million  including intercompany sales of million in the year ended december  compared to million including intercompany sales of million in the same period in the increase of million or reflected increased customer demand for smaller quantity lots and custom sizes from the several distribution centers throughout the country 
small quantity and custom size lots resulted in increased revenue of million 
sales through the group s european outlets were increased million and the company s acquisition of claro precision  inc  added million 
sales from the group s fabrication units primarily through intercompany channels added million in increased revenue from the year ago period 
sales through f d amounted to million  including intercompany sales of million in the year ended december  compared to million including intercompany sales of million in the same period in the decrease of million or was a result of reduced demand from aerospace customers in both the united states and europe 
of the decrease of million approximately was reduced revenue in the united states and in europe 
gross profit loss year ended december  titanium group fabrication distribution group total titanium group gross profit loss decreased to a million loss in from a gross profit of million in or a change of million 
reduced prices on mill products net of mix effects resulted in a reduction in product margins of million 
prices were reduced from the year ago period by over per pound as prices dropped to an average of from the prior period of per pound 
the reduced prices were partially due to the effect of lower price mix of goods sold 
inventory reductions in lifo inventories resulted in increased cost of sales of million  increased metallics costs equaled million and the effect of the contract cancellation with the doe resulted in reduced gross profits of million 
other cost increases of million included increased healthcare and pension costs 
gross profit decreased to million in from a gross profit of million in or a change of million 
the decrease in gross profit was a result of a reduction in mill product shipments of million pounds 
the reduced titanium shipment level necessitated temporary production outages as the company s niles  ohio facility maintained inventory balances in line with lower shipment levels 
the reduced shipment level occurred primarily in heavy shapes as demand for these products from forging companies for use in commercial aircraft and certain industrial applications fell 
fabrication and distribution group gross profit increased to million in from a gross profit of million in or a favorable change of million 
most of the favorable change was a result of increased revenues in the group s distribution businesses as a increase in revenue from these businesses resulted in improved margins of million 
the company made a canadian acquisition in the fourth quarter which increased gross profit by million 
the effect of reduced revenues for energy projects of partially offset the distribution business and canadian improvements 
gross profit decreased to million in from a gross profit of million in or an unfavorable change of million 
the unfavorable change of was due to the group s energy business in concluding work on a major project that provided significantly higher margins in the reduction in energy caused a reduction in gross profits of 
reduced demand from aerospace customers in the united states and europe resulted in a reduction of gross profits by approximately 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended december  titanium group fabrication distribution group total titanium group selling  general and administrative expenses  increased million in from the same period in the increase was primarily due to the company s cost associated with the implementation of the sarbanes oxley act  section sox which amounted to million 
partially offsetting the increased expense was the effect of the elimination of most sg a activities at the group s ashtabula site which had been notified in december of that the doe contract was being terminated by the doe for convenience and reduced legal and rent expenses 
it is not known at this time what role  if any  rmi will play in the balance of the cleanup although discussions are ongoing 
the reduction of the ashtabula sg a expenses equaled million and the legal and rent expenses amounted to million 
selling  general and administrative expenses  decreased million in from the same period in the decrease reflected a reduction in corporate overhead charges that are allocated based on a formula which among several factors includes sales as a percent of the total company 
the larger percentage reduction in sales from to resulted in a lower amount of corporate costs charged to the titanium group and a correspondingly higher amount charged to the fabrication and distribution group 
fabrication and distribution group sg a increased million in from in the f d group 
the increase was primarily due to the implementation of sox resulting in increased expenses in the group of million 
the group  primarily the distribution business  experienced significant growth in sales resulting in the addition of additional personnel  increased compensation and increased overhead equaling million 
the company acquired a canadian company in the fourth quarter of  expanded sales and marketing efforts into mainland china during the year and increased its sales and marketing efforts in energy  and europe resulting in increased expenses of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses  increased million in from the same period in as a result of the allocation issue described in the titanium group 
additionally  the increase was partially offset as certain depreciation expense previously recorded in sg a in was reclassified to cost of sales and bad debt expense was million higher in than in research  technical and product development expenses year ended december  titanium group fabrication distribution group total additional development activities conducted at customer expense not included above totaled  and for  and  respectively 
titanium group there was no change in expenses for the group in  or fabrication and distribution group in the group did not incur expenses related to r d  which represented a decrease of million from the prior year r d expenditures in this group are primarily in the energy business area 
the decrease in represented the completion of an r d project in the energy business in the change in r d expenditures from to represented an energy business project completed in other operating income year ended december  titanium group fabrication distribution group total titanium group other operating income decreased million in from the same period in the decrease was a result of a gain recorded in of million on the sale of certain buildings at the company s ashtabula facility 
in the company sold its site in salt lake city  utah and recorded a gain of million 
other operating income increased million in from the same period in the increase was a result of the net gain on a sale lease back of certain buildings and land at the company s ashtabula  ohio facility 
fabrication and distribution group the group did not have any activity in other operating income for the periods reported 
operating loss income year ended december  titanium group fabrication distribution group total titanium group operating losses increased in to a loss of million from a loss of million in the increase of million in loss was a result of reduced selling prices on product of million  lifo inventory liquidations of million  increased metallics cost of million and the effect of the doe contract cancellation in of million 
additional expenses for healthcare and pension expense resulted in an increase in expenses of million 
sg a expenses were increased by million primarily related to application of sox net of reduced expenses from the doe contract termination and reduced legal and rent expenses 
operating losses in equaled million in compared to a reported income in of million or a change of million unfavorable 
the unfavorable change reflects a decrease in mill product shipments due to a decline in forged mill products demand from the commercial aerospace market  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of one of the company s ashtabula  ohio facilities 
fabrication and distribution group operating losses in equaled million in compared to an income in of million or an unfavorable change of million 
the unfavorable change was due to an increase in sg a expenses of million caused by the expenses associated with the implementation of sox of million  increased compensation of million and the expansion of marketing efforts internationally and the acquisition of a canadian company which totaled million 
offsetting the increased sg a was increased gross profits of million primarily on increased revenues 
operating income equaled million in compared to operating income of million in or an unfavorable change of million 
the change was due to weak demand for products sold to commercial aerospace and a reduction in the profitability of the group s energy business principally due to timing of the completion of long term orders 
other income year ended december  other income other income increased by million in compared to the same period in the increase was caused in part by an increase in the amount received from boeing for liquidated damages on a long term contract 
other income for the year ended december  was million compared to other income of million in or an unfavorable change of million 
the unfavorable change was due to the receipt in of a million common stock distribution in connection with the demutualization of one of the company s insurance carriers 
this amount was partially offset by the increase in the amount received for liquidated damages from boeing of million 
interest income expense  net year ended december  total interest income expense  net interest income expense  net changed million favorable as interest income of million was recorded in compared to interest expense in of million 
the favorable change was the result of interest income earned on cash balances in excess of bank fees incurred on the unused capacity of the company s credit revolver 
interest income expense  net changed million favorable as interest expense of million was recorded in compared to interest expense in of million 
the favorable change was the result of the net effect of interest income earned on cash balances partially offsetting interest expense as a result of unused capacity fees on the company s credit revolver 
income tax benefit expense year ended december  income taxes benefit expense income tax benefit for was million compared to million in expense for the same period in the effective income tax rate in was compared to a rate of in the rate was increased as a result of adjustments of prior year taxes from three sources normal revisions in estimates from filing tax returns  tax reserve adjustments related to a reassessment of potential exposures identified in prior years  and adjustments to certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the release of current liabilities identified in reconciling deferred tax temporary differences 
income taxes decreased by million as a result of a decrease in pretax income and a decrease of in the effective tax rate 
the effective income tax rate in was compared to a rate of in the rate was reduced as a result of the net effect of a reduction in the amount of estimated tax provision for previously recorded federal income taxes 
loss from discontinued operations year ended december  discontinued operations the operations of the company s welded tubing operations were deemed a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of as the operation was unable to source input material to satisfy its customers 
the company recorded a million net of tax expense in compared to breakeven results net of tax in the breakeven results net of tax in is a presentation of the prior years effect of the tubing operations 
the unfavorable change of million was the result of a net of tax loss on disposal of million and an unfavorable change in net of tax income of million 
the favorable change of million in net of tax income as restated reflects the change from a net of tax loss in of million to a breakeven result net of tax in net loss income year ended december  net loss income net income loss changed unfavorably by million in compared to the same period in the net loss of million in represented of sales compared to a net profit of million in or of sales 
net income changed unfavorably by million in compared to the same period in net income of million in or of sales compares to net income of million in or of sales 
outlook overview beginning in  a confluence of events including the weak us and global economies  combined with the terrorist attacks of september  followed by ongoing conflicts in the middle east and the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  had a significant adverse affect on the overall titanium industry  through beginning in however  the world economies began to improve  air traffic demand rose significantly in the commercial aircraft segment  and defense spending continued to grow  leading to a rebound in the demand for titanium and speciality metal products 
according to the us geological survey  us shipments of titanium mill products declined from a high of approximately million pounds in to approximately million pounds in the company believes shipment levels in increased due to an inventory replenishment cycle along with improved demand in all market segments  and expect us shipments to reach approximately million pounds in aircraft manufactures  as well as aerospace forecasters  all predict that the growth in commercial aerospace  and therefore titanium  will continue to increase in and beyond 
the following is a discussion of the company s belief of what is happening within each of the three major markets in which rti participates 
commercial aerospace markets aerospace demand is classified into two sectors commercial aerospace and defense programs 
demand from these two sectors comprises approximately of the worldwide consumption for titanium products and in the us comprises approximately of titanium consumption 
the company s sales to this market represented of total sales in  up from in due to a greater participation in the regional and business jet market with the acquisition of claro precision  inc in canada which was completed in october  due to reduced demand  boeing and airbus reduced their build rates for large commercial aircraft to planes in  a reduction from the prior year 
however  a turnaround began in  with major producers delivering new aircraft 
according to the airline monitor  the combined production of large commercial aircraft by boeing and airbus is forecast to reach aircraft in  aircraft in  aircraft in  and aircraft in airbus is now producing the world s largest commercial aircraft  the a  and boeing has launched a new composite and titanium aircraft  the in addition  airbus has approved another new aircraft  the a  to compete with boeing s model 
all three of these aircraft are expected to use large quantities of titanium  in the second half of this decade 
longer term  the commercial aerospace sector is expected to be a very significant consumer of titanium products over the next years due to the expected long term growth of worldwide traffic and the need to repair and replace aging commercial fleets 
titanium mill products that are ordered by the prime aircraft producers and their subcontractors are generally ordered in advance of final aircraft production by six to eighteen months 
this is due to the time it takes to produce a final assembly or part that is ready for installation in an airframe or jet engine 
rmi entered into a long term agreement with boeing on january  under this agreement  rmi agreed to supply boeing and its family of commercial suppliers with up to million pounds of titanium products annually 
the agreement  which began in  had an initial term of five years and concluded at the end of under the accord  boeing received firm prices in exchange for rmi receiving a minimum volume commitment of million pounds per year 
if volumes fell short of the minimum commitment  the contract contained provisions for financial compensation 
in accordance with the agreement  and as a result of volume shortfalls in    and  boeing settled claims of approximately million in both and and million in the claim for was settled during the first quarter of for approximately million 
boeing ordered million pounds in  the final year of the contract  and accordingly  the company received a payment of million in march when boeing satisfied the final claim under the contract 
beginning in january of  business between the companies not covered by other contracts is being conducted on a non committed basis  that is  no volume commitment by boeing and no commitment of capacity or price by rmi 
rti acquired claro precision  inc  montreal  canada  in october of claro supplies precision machining and complex sub assemblies to the aerospace industry  primarily bombardier 
the acquisition provides rti with additional manufacturing capabilities as well as access to the regional and business jet markets 
rti  through its rti europe subsidiary  entered into an agreement with the european aeronautic defense and space company eads in january to continue to supply value added titanium products and parts to the eads group of companies  including airbus 
the contract is in place through  subject to extension 
the new airbus a is expected to utilize more titanium per aircraft than any commercial plane yet produced 
in  airbus became the world s largest producer of commercial aircraft and this continued in defense markets shipments to military markets represented approximately of the company s revenues and are expected to remain significant as a percent of total sales in as us and other countries defense budgets remain strong 
in fact  the latest us department of defense budget figures for research  development testing and evaluation rdt e and procurement reflect an increase of from through rti believes it is well positioned to supply mill products and fabrications required for any increase in demand from this market 
rti currently supplies titanium and other materials to most military aerospace programs  including the f a  c  f a  f  f  joint strike fighter jsf and in europe  the mirage  rafale and eurofighter typhoon 
lockheed martin  a major customer of the company  was awarded the largest military contract ever on october   for the military s billion jsf program 
the aircraft  which will be used by all branches of the military  is expected to consume  to  pounds of titanium per airplane 
timing and order patterns  which are likely to extend well into the future for this program  have not been quantified  but may be as many as  to  planes over the life of the program 
the company has entered into agreements with lockheed and its teaming partner  bae systems  to be the supplier of titanium sheet and plate for the design and development phase of the program 
the company entered into a new agreement with bae systems in january to provide value added titanium flat rolled products for the eurofighter aircraft through the company was chosen by bae systems ro defence uk to supply the titanium components for the new xm lightweight mm howitzer 
delivery began late in and will continue through initial deliveries will be to the us marine corps  followed by deliveries to the us army and the italian and british armed forces 
it is anticipated that over  guns may be produced 
sales under this contract could potentially exceed million 
industrial and consumer markets of rti s revenues were generated in various industrial and consumer markets where business conditions are expected to experience increased demand over the next twelve months due to the demand for oil and gas products in the deep water and more hostile environments 
revenues from oil and gas markets are expected to be increased in and beyond due to continued activity in deep water projects 
the company s welded tubing operations supplied commercially pure titanium products to various customers for use in industrial operations 
the company s normal supplier advised that it was unable to meet orders due to their inability to obtain raw materials from their suppliers 
the company was unable to find alternate sources of material and had no choice but to declare the welded tubing operations a discontinued business in the physical facilities  previously utilized for the production of welded tube  are being used to support other areas of rti s operations 
in january  rti energy systems was selected by bp to provide titanium stress joints for its shah deniz project located in the caspian sea  azerbaijan 
titanium was chosen because both strength and flexibility will be needed to deal with the strong currents in the development area 
fabrication will begin in and shipments will be made over the next months 
the company operates a facility that produces ferro titanium  an additive to certain grades of steel 
the recent world wide demand for steel has significantly increased demand for ferro titanium 
sales of ferro titanium constituted over of total sales in and demand is expected to be strong again in rti serves a number of other industrial and consumer markets through its distribution businesses 
the products sold and applications served are numerous and varied 
the resulting diversity tends to provide sales stability through varying market conditions 
the company believes demand from these markets will continue to improve in and beyond as economic conditions continue to show improvement 
backlog the company s order backlog for all market segments increased to million as of december   up from million at december   principally from titanium mill product markets 
the increase in the backlog  is primarily due to increased demand from the aerospace industry 
of the backlog at december   million is not likely to be filled in the company includes in its backlog those orders from customers that are represented by a bona fide purchase order or an executable contract 
in most cases  prior to the company incurring production cost to complete an order  a customer may cancel the order without penalty 
if the company has incurred cost for a customer order the customer is liable to reimburse the company for out of pocket expenses 
in the case of certain high dollar energy contracts the contract normally provides for damages and fees based on particular milestones 
liquidity and capital resources dollars in millions the company believes it will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund operations and capital expenditures in in addition  rti has cash reserves and available borrowing capacity to maintain adequate liquidity 
rti currently has no debt  and based on the expected strength of cash flows  the company does not believe there are any material near term risks related to fluctuations in interest rates 
cash provided by operating activities year ended december  cash provided by operating activities the decrease in net cash flows from operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily reflects a decrease in net income of million due to a decline in business operating results as mentioned in the results of operations section of management s discussion and analysis 
the remainder of the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash generated from reductions in working capital and other balance sheet line items 
the most significant items driving the decrease in cash generated from changes in working capital and other balance sheet line items when comparing to are accounts receivable  inventory and the liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
changes in accounts receivable decreased cash generated as billings exceeded cash collections in compared to the increase in billings reflects an improvement in market conditions in the last quarter of compared to changes in inventory levels generated cash as the value of shipments exceeded purchases in changes in the liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings generated less cash in than in as it decreased due primarily to the company fulfilling obligations and recognizing revenue relating to advanced payments on long term orders 
the decrease in net cash flows from operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily reflects a decrease in net income of million due to decline in business operating results as mentioned in the results of operations section of management s discussion and analysis 
the remainder of the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash generated from reductions in working capital and other balance sheet line items 
the most significant items driving the decrease in cash generated from changes in working capital and other balance sheet line items when comparing to are accounts receivable  inventory and the liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
changes in accounts receivable generated cash as cash collections exceeded billings in the decrease in billings reflected the general decline in the commercial aerospace industry though the decrease was greater in changes in inventory levels also generated cash as the value of shipments exceeded purchases in both and  as a result of management s efforts to match inventory levels to the decline in business  though the decrease was greater in changes in the liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings generated less cash in than in as it increased due to the company receipt of cash payments in advance of work completed on additional long term orders 
the company s working capital ratio was to and to at december  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities year ended december  cash used in investing activities gross capital expenditures for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million in and million in in all periods  capital spending primarily reflected equipment additions and improvements as well as information systems projects 
partially offsetting the capital expenditures in were proceeds of 
million relating to the sale of property and equipment at the company s salt lake city  utah facilities 
during the years ended december   and  the company s cash flow requirements for capital expenditures were funded with cash provided by operations 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures for will total approximately million and will be funded with cash generated by operations 
acquisitions net of cash acquired amount to million 
million related to the acquisitions of claro precision  inc  the remaining million being the acquisition of the outstanding minority interest in galt alloys 
at december   the company had a borrowing capacity equal to million 
cash provided by used in financing activities year ended december  cash provided by used in financing activities the favorable change in cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily reflects an increase in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of million in compared to million in the favorable change in cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily reflects an increase in proceeds from exercise of employee stock options of million in contractual obligations  commitments and post retirement benefits following is a summary of the company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  dollars in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total operating leases      capital leases total contractual obligations      commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration per period thereafter total long term supply agreements     purchase obligations   standby letters of credit   total commercial commitments     post retirement benefits thereafter total post retirement benefits        see note to the company s financial statements 
amounts represent commitments for which contractual terms exceed twelve months 
amounts primarily represent purchase commitments under purchase orders 
amounts represent standby letters of credit primarily related to commercial performance and insurance guarantees 
the company does not fund its other post retirement employee benefits obligation but instead pays amounts when incurred 
however  these estimates are based on current benefit plan coverage and are not contractual commitments in as much as the company retains the right to modify  reduce  or terminate any such coverage in the future 
amounts shown in the years through are based on actuarial estimates of expected future cash payments 
the company is not forecasting or required to make a pension contribution in as in past years  the company may make voluntary contributions when there is an economic advantage to contribute to the fund 
future contributions to the fund  if required  will be provided based on actuarial evaluation 
credit agreement the company amended its former million  three year credit agreement on june  the amendment provides for million of standby credit through may  the company has the option to increase the available credit to million with the addition of another bank  without the approval of the existing bank group 
the terms and conditions of the amended facility remain unchanged with the exception that the tangible net worth covenant in the replaced facility was eliminated 
under the terms of the amended facility  the company  at its option  will be able to borrow at a a base rate which is the higher of pnc bank s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus per annum  or b libor plus a spread ranging from to determined by the ratio of the company s consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the credit agreement contains restrictions  among others  on the minimum cash flow required  and the maximum leverage ratio permitted 
at december  the company had million of standby letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
environmental matters the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations as well as various health and safety laws and regulations that are subject to frequent modifications and revisions 
during the years ended december   and  the company spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  for environmental remediation  compliance  and related services 
the company estimates environmental related expenditures  including capital items and compliance costs  will total approximately million for and million for while the costs of compliance for these matters have not had a material adverse impact on the company in the past  it is impossible to predict accurately the ultimate effect these changing laws and regulations may have on the company in the future 
the company continues to evaluate its obligations for environmental related costs on a quarterly basis and makes adjustments in accordance with provisions of statement of position no 
 environmental remediation liabilities 
the company is involved in investigative or cleanup projects under federal or state environmental laws at a number of waste disposal sites  including the fields brook superfund site and the ashtabula river area of concern 
given the status of the proceedings with respect to these sites  ultimate investigative and remediation costs cannot presently be accurately predicted  but could  in the aggregate be material 
based on the information available regarding the current ranges of estimated remediation costs at currently active sites  and what the company believes will be its ultimate share of such costs  provisions for environmental related costs have been recorded 
given the status of the proceedings at certain of these sites  and the evolving nature of environmental laws  regulations  and remediation techniques  the company s ultimate obligation for investigative and remediation costs cannot be predicted 
it is the company s policy to recognize environmental costs in its financial statements when an obligation becomes probable and a reasonable estimate of exposure can be determined 
at december   the amount accrued for future environmental related costs was million 
of the total amount accrued at december   million is expected to be paid out during and is included in the other accrued liabilities line of the balance sheet 
the remaining million is recorded in other non current liabilities 
the company has included in other non current assets million as expected contributions from third parties 
this amount represents the contributions from third parties in conjunction with the company s most likely estimate of its accrued amount of million 
based on available information  rmi believes that its share of potential environmental related costs  before expected contributions form third parties  is in a range from to million in the aggregate 
as these proceedings continue toward final resolution  amounts in excess of those already provided may be necessary to discharge the company from its obligations for these sites

critical accounting policies rti s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the amounts recorded for assets and liabilities and resulting revenue and expenses 
management estimates are based on historical evidence and other available information  which in management s opinion provide the most reasonable and likely result under the current facts and circumstances 
under different facts and circumstances expected results may differ materially from the facts and circumstances applied by management 
of the accounting policies described in note of the company s financial statements and others not expressly stated but adopted by management as the most appropriate and reasonable under the current facts and circumstances  the effect upon the company of the policy of goodwill and intangible assets  long lived assets  income taxes  employee benefit plans  environmental liabilities and certain valuation accounts described below would be most critical if management estimates were incorrect 
generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying values of valuation accounts receivable  duty drawback property  plant and equipment  goodwill  pensions  post retirement benefits  workers compensation  environmental liabilities and income taxes 
goodwill and intangible assets 
in the case of goodwill and long lived assets  if future product demand or market conditions reduce management s expectation of future cash flows from these assets  a write down of the carrying value of goodwill or long lived assets may be required 
intangible assets were valued at fair value with the assistance of outside experts 
in the event that demand or market conditions change and the expected future cash flows associated to these assets is reduced  a write down or acceleration of the amortization period may be required 
intangible assets are amortized over years 
management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of the reporting units are determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on historical and projected financial information 
the carrying value of goodwill at december  was million and million at december   representing and total assets  respectively 
management relies on its estimate of cash flow projections using business and economic data available at the time the projection is calculated 
a significant number of assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the discounted cash flow model to forecast operating cash flows  including overall conditions  sales volumes and prices  costs of production  and working capital changes 
the discounted cash flow evaluation is completed annually in the fourth quarter  absent any events throughout the year which would indicate an impairment 
if an event were to occur that indicates a potential impairment  the company would perform a discounted cash flow evaluation prior to the fourth quarter 
at december  the results of management s assessment did not indicate an impairment 
results of the test in did indicate that the difference between carrying value and discounted cash flows had been reduced from prior years for one of the company s reportable units 
no events occurred during that would indicate a potential impairment exists 
long lived assets 
management evaluates the recoverability of property plant  and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such asset may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in circumstances may include technological changes  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions  or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other items  our assumptions about the estimated undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  the company will recognize an impairment loss 
management applies its best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets  and the fair value of the asset 
income taxes 
in the case of deferred tax assets  management has provided under current facts and circumstances what it believes to be adequate allowances for reduced value 
similar to goodwill and long lived assets  should the future benefit of deferred tax assets become impaired because of the possibility of reduced utilization  an increase to the valuation allowance and corresponding charge to expense may be required 
the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences was million at december  and million at december  the company has provided a valuation allowance to fully offset deferred tax assets at one of its foreign entities as it became uncertain that those assets  consisting principally of net operating losses  would be utilized see note 
deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a part of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income or equity  as appropriate  in the period in which the determination were made 
employee benefit plans 
included in the company s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans are assumptions on future discount rates  expected return on assets and rate of future compensation changes 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  as well as longer term assumptions in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension expense or income recorded in the future 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
in general  the company s liability increases as the discount rate decreases and decreases as the discount rate increases 
the company considers a variety of sources that provide rates on high quality aaa aa corporate bonds and other sources in order to select a discount rate that best matches its pension investment profile 
the company reduced its discount rate at december  and to determine its future benefit obligation 
the discount rate at december  was and at december  was 
the discount rate is a significant factor in determining the amounts reported 
a one quarter percent change in the discount rate of at december  would have the following effect in millions of dollars effect on total projected benefit obligation pbo in millions effect on subsequent years periodic pension expense in millions decreases in the level of plan assets have a direct impact on the amount of periodic pension expense the company records 
during the value of the company s plan assets increased as improved returns occurred particularly on equities held by the fund 
the company assumed an expected rate of return to record expense during  which was the same as the company is expected to use in at december   the estimated accumulated benefit obligation related to plan assets exceeded the value of those assets 
the reduction in the discount rate from to and a decrease on the return of plan assets from to resulted in an adjustment to equity to reflect an increase in the additional minimum liability of million  net of deferred taxes 
pension expense in will increase million 
the company currently does not have any minimum funding obligations under erisa but continually evaluates whether the best use of its cash may include a contribution to the pension plans 
if the company chooses to make a contribution prior to the funding deadline  the increase in pension expense for will likely decrease 
environmental liabilities 
the company provides for environmental liabilities when these liabilities become probable and can be reasonably determined 
the company regularly evaluates and assesses its environmental responsibilities 
should facts and circumstances indicate that a liability exists or that previously evaluated and assessed liabilities have changed  the company will record the liability or adjust the amount of an existing liability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk and price fluctuations related to the purchases of certain materials and supplies used in its manufacturing operations 
the company obtains competitive prices for materials and supplies when available 
the majority of the company s raw material purchases for titanium sponge are made under long term contracts with negotiated prices 
the company s long term credit arrangement is based on rates that float with libor based rates or bank prime rates and the carrying value approximates fair value 
at december   the company had no outstanding obligations under this credit arrangement 
the company is subject to foreign currency exchange exposure for purchases of materials  equipment and services  including wages  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as non dollar denominated sales 
from time to time the company may use forward exchange contracts to manage these risks  although they are generally considered to be minimal 
the majority of the company s sales are made in us dollars  which minimizes exposure to foreign currency fluctuation
