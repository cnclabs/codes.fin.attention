company wide focus on technology 
albertsons utilizes technology to better serve customers  connect with consumers and to improve operating efficiencies 
in  albertsons established an information technology plan  which called for the replacement or upgrade of over three quarters of the company s current systems by as the five year strategy continues to be executed  the company is leveraging technology as a strategic asset throughout the company  from supply chain  merchandising and customer service to human resources 
the company believes that its investment in technology systems and processes will help to create an industry leadership position and a competitive advantage 
a robust governance council manages the strategic roadmap  ensuring that projects are on track and on time 

table of contents energized associates 
the albertsons leadership team is charged with creating an uplifting atmosphere for associates and inspiring positive attitudes throughout the company 
albertsons believes that a team of energized associates who share a positive attitude will help to create a competitive advantage for the company 
associates are energized by a culture of lifelong learning  the ability to participate in career development and advancement opportunities  diversity networks and affinity groups and a performance management process that requires goal setting  tracking and measuring

competitive compensation programs are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they are meeting the needs of associates and the company 
consistent  frequent communication from leaders is well established through a series of weekly and monthly satellite broadcasts  a weekly online message from the ceo  and regularly scheduled town hall meetings 
the company s focus on these five strategic imperatives is designed to address the intense competitive landscape of the retail food and drug industry 
today  direct competition comes from a variety of sources  including supermarket chains  independent and specialty grocers  specialty retailers and large scale drug retailers 
increasing competition also exists from convenience stores  prepared food retailers  internet and mail order retailers 
the biggest competitive impact on the food retailing industry  however  has been the growth of low price retailers  primarily supercenters and discount stores 
the rapid growth of this format has shown that while convenience  quality  product assortment and customer service remain important factors in creating a competitive advantage  price is increasingly a significant driver of consumer choice in the food retailing industry 
rapid growth of the supercenter format has been most evident in markets such as the northwest and southwest portions of the united states 
competition from discount formats is now increasing in other geographic areas 
also impacting the retail food and drug industry is the overall economy of the united states 
while most key economic indicators impact the company s operations to some degree  there are higher correlations to food inflation  fuel prices and consumer confidence 
as the low price retail format continues to grow  the ability of the company to pass along price increases in times of food inflation is challenging  which negatively impacts gross margin 
similarly  when fuel prices increase and consumer confidence remains low  the price sensitivity of the already price conscious consumer increases 
notwithstanding these competitive and economic forces  the company believes that its relentless focus on its five strategic imperatives will enable it to eventually achieve its vision becoming the world s number one food and drug retailer in the areas of market value  scale and profitability 
certain amounts in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of february  included herein differ from those amounts reported in the company s preliminary unaudited balance sheet included in the earnings release dated march  these differences arose from a change in tax balances and goodwill related to the company s acquisition of shaw s  specifically in prepaid and other current assets  goodwill  other current liabilities and other long term liabilities and deferred credits

the company is contingently liable for certain operating leases that were assigned to third parties in connection with various store closures and dispositions 
if any of these third parties fails to perform its obligations under the lease  the company could be responsible for the lease obligations 
in the company was notified that certain of these third parties had become insolvent and were seeking bankruptcy protection 
at january   approximately store leases for which the company was contingently liable were subject to the bankruptcy proceedings of such third parties and of those had been rejected by the applicable third party 
the company recorded pre tax charges of in  which represents the remaining minimum lease 
table of contents payments and other payment obligations under the rejected leases  less estimated sublease income and discounted at the company s credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
as of february   approximately store leases remained for which the company is contingently liable 
terminations and payments made on these leases in resulted in a reduction of the company s contingent liability of as of february   the company had remaining guarantees on approximately stores with leases extending through assuming that each respective purchaser became insolvent  an event the company believes to be remote because of the wide dispersion among third parties and the variety of remedies available  the minimum future undiscounted payments  exclusive of any potential sublease income  are the company enters into a wide range of indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business 
these include tort indemnities  tax indemnities  indemnities against third party claims arising out of arrangements to provide services to the company  indemnities in merger and acquisition agreements and indemnities in agreements related to the sale of company securities 
also  governance documents of the company and substantially all of its subsidiaries provide for the indemnification of individuals made party to any suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that the individual was acting as an officer  director or agent of the relevant company or as a fiduciary of a company sponsored welfare benefit plan 
the company also provides guarantees and indemnifications for the benefit of many of its wholly owned subsidiaries for the satisfaction of performance obligations  including workers compensation obligations 
it is difficult to quantify the maximum potential liability under these indemnifications  however at february  the company was not aware of any material liabilities arising from these indemnification arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements at february   the company had no significant investments that were accounted for under the equity method in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
investments that were accounted for under the equity method at february  had no liabilities associated with them that were guaranteed by or that would be considered material to albertsons 
accordingly  the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities 
capital expenditures the company is committed to keeping its stores up to date 
in the last three years  the company has opened or remodeled stores  representing of the company s retail square footage as of february  the following summary of historical capital expenditures includes capital leases  excluding the shaw s and bristol farms acquisitions new and acquired stores remodels retail replacement equipment  technology and other distribution facilities and equipment total capital expenditures total capital expenditures include capitalized lease obligations incurred of in  in and in the company s financial position provides the flexibility for the company to grow through its store development program and future acquisitions 
the company s capital expenditure budget for is estimated between  to  and includes new capital and operating lease obligations 
related party transactions transactions with related parties were not considered material 
see note related party transactions in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
insurance contingencies the company has outstanding workers compensation and general liability claims with a former insurance carrier that is experiencing financial difficulties 
if the insurer fails to pay any covered claims that exceed deductible limits  creating excess claims  the company may have the ability to present these excess claims to guarantee funds in certain states in which the claims originated 
as of february   the insurance carrier continued to pay the company s claims 
the company currently cannot estimate the amount of the covered claims in excess of deductible limits which will not be paid by the insurance carrier or otherwise 
although the company currently believes that it may recover at least some of these excess claim amounts  the unrecoverable amount could be material 
the company is in discussions with the carrier regarding transfer of primary claim responsibility back to the company in exchange for a payment  which payment may be less than the projected claim liability 
the company is presently unable to determine the outcome of these discussions 
environmental the company has identified environmental contamination sites related primarily to underground petroleum storage tanks and groundwater contamination at various store  warehouse  office and manufacturing facilities related to current operations as well as previously disposed of properties 
the company conducts an ongoing program for the inspection and evaluation of potential new sites and the remediation and monitoring of contamination at existing and previously owned sites 
although the ultimate outcome and expense of environmental remediation is uncertain  the company believes that the costs of required remediation and continuing compliance with environmental laws  in excess of current reserves  will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
environmental remediation costs were not material in  or 
table of contents critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  vendor funds  intangible assets  income taxes  assets held for sale  impairment of long lived assets  self insurance  restructuring  benefit costs  contingencies  litigation and unearned income 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company  based on its ongoing review  will make adjustments to its judgments and estimates where facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are important to understand the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
vendor funds the company receives funds from many of the vendors whose products the company buys for resale in its stores 
these vendor funds are provided to increase the sell through of the related products 
the company receives funds for a variety of merchandising activities placement of the vendor s products in the company s advertising  display of the vendor s products in prominent locations in the company s stores  introduction of new products into the company s distribution system and retail stores  exclusivity rights in certain categories that have slower turning products  and to compensate for temporary price reductions offered to customers on products held for sale at retail stores 
the company also receives vendor funds for buying activities  such as volume commitment rebates and credits for purchasing products in advance of their need 
as of february   the terms of the company s vendor funds arrangements varied in length from short term arrangements that are to be completed within a quarter to long term arrangements that are expected to be completed within eight years 
accounting for vendor funds is discussed in emerging issues task force eitf issue accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  which the company adopted as of the beginning of as a result of this guidance  the company began recognizing the vendor funds for merchandising activities as a reduction of cost of sales when the related products are sold as opposed to the previous method of recognizing these credits as a reduction of cost of sales when the merchandising activity was performed in accordance with the underlying agreements 
vendor funds that have been earned as a result of completing the required performance under the terms of the underlying agreements but for which the product has not yet been sold are recognized as reductions of inventory 
the amount of vendor funds remaining in ending inventory requires management judgment and estimates 
management estimates these amounts based on the average inventory turnover rates by product category for the company s grocery  general merchandise and lobby departments and by average inventory turnover rates by department for the company s remaining inventory 
the amount of vendor funds reducing the company s inventory inventory offset as of february   including those resulting from the acquisitions made during fiscal refer to note business acquisitions in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements was  a decrease of from the beginning of fiscal the vendor funds inventory offset as of january  was  an increase of from the beginning of fiscal long lived asset impairments the company regularly reviews long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
management s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on operational performance 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value of long lived assets is impaired 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable  the fair value of the asset is compared to its carrying value 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of the assets is determined by internal real estate specialists or by independent valuations from subject matter experts 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by factors such as changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment and inflation 
for properties that have closed and are under long term operating lease agreements  the present value of any remaining liability under the lease  discounted using credit risk free rates and net of estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property  is recognized as a liability and charged to operations 
the value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect net recoverable values 
internal real estate specialists estimate the subtenant income and asset recovery values based on their historical experience and knowledge of the market in which the store to be closed is located  the results of the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and the current economic conditions 
the actual cost of disposition for these leases and related assets is affected by factors such as specific real estate markets  the economic environment and inflation 
goodwill the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in upon adoption  the aggregate of the goodwill allocated to the stores in each reporting unit became the reporting units goodwill balance 
in order to determine if a reporting unit s goodwill was impaired  a combination of internal analyses and estimates of fair value from independent valuation specialists were used 
based on these analyses  there was no impairment of goodwill at the adoption date 
subsequently  during the fourth quarter of  and  the company completed its annual impairment review and determined that there was no 
table of contents impairment 
the fair value estimates could change in the future depending on internal and external factors  including the success of strategic sourcing initiatives  labor cost controls and competitive activity 
self insurance the company is primarily self insured for property loss  workers compensation  automobile liability costs and general liability costs 
the company records its self insurance liability  determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
any actuarial projection of ultimate losses is subject to a high degree of variability 
sources of this variability are numerous and include  but are not limited to  future development of previous claims  future economic conditions  court decisions and legislative actions 
for example  workers compensation costs were  and in  and respectively 
excluding the results of shaw s and bristol farms  workers compensation expense remained flat in as compared with the increase in costs from to was primarily attributable to development of prior year claims that were higher than previously estimated while the annual number of workers compensation claims had decreased year to year 
the company s workers compensation liabilities are from claims occurring in various states 
individual state workers compensation regulations have received a tremendous amount of attention from state politicians  insurers  employers and providers  as well as the public in general 
recent years have seen an escalation in the number of legislative reforms  judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting workers compensation 
the changes in a state s political and economic environment increase the variability in the unpaid claim liabilities 
the company s workers compensation reserves do not contemplate any of these potential developments 
legal contingencies the company records reserves for legal contingencies  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  when the information available to the company indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
predicting the outcomes of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposures involve substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates 
in addition  the company regularly monitors its exposure to the loss contingencies associated with these matters and may from time to time change its predictions with respect to outcomes and its estimates with respect to related costs and exposures 
it is possible that material differences in actual outcomes  costs and exposures relative to current predictions and estimates  or material changes in such predictions or estimates  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
pension costs pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are dependent on the company s selection of actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
actual returns on plan assets exceeded return assumptions over an extended period in the past  which kept pension expense and cash contributions to the plans at modest levels 
weaker market performance may significantly increase pension expense and cash contributions in the future 
changes in the interest rates used to determine the discount rate may also cause volatility in pension expense and cash contributions 
actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the company s recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
for example  in the company maintained the existing albertsons defined benefit and defined contribution plans for albertsons associates and  following the acquisition of shaw s  assumed the obligations of the shaw s retirement plans 
in  the discount rate assumption for the albertsons plans was and its long term asset return assumption was 
using these assumptions  the company s pension expense for the albertsons plans was  following expense of in and in if the company had decreased its estimated discount rate to and its expected return on plan assets to  the company s pension expense for the albertsons plans would have been and net earnings would have decreased approximately if the company had increased its discount rate assumption to and its expected return on plan assets to  pension expense for the albertsons plans would have been and net earnings would have increased approximately for the shaw s plans  the company s pension expense was using a discount rate assumption of and a long term asset return assumption of 
if the company had decreased its estimated discount rate to and its expected return on plan assets to for the shaw s plans  pension expense would have been and net earnings would have decreased approximately if the company had increased its discount rate assumption to and its expected return on plan assets to for the shaw s plans  pension expense would have been and net earnings would have increased approximately recently issued and adopted accounting standards in july the fasb issued sfas no
