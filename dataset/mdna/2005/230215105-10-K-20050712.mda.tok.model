item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes attached thereto 
overview the company s fiscal year is the or week period ending on the sunday closest to april the year ended may  included weeks versus weeks for the same period of fiscal the company s operating segments are mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics  with related divisions organized within those segments 
in mattress fabrics  culp home fashions markets a broad array of fabrics used by bedding manufacturers 
in upholstery fabrics  culp decorative fabrics markets jacquard woven fabrics for residential and commercial furniture and yarn for use primarily by the company  with some outside sales 
culp velvets prints markets velvet  printed fabrics and microdenier suedes used primarily for residential furniture 
effective may   the company began allocating selling  general and administrative expenses to its operating segments and began evaluating the operating performance of its segments based upon income loss from operations before restructuring and related charges or credits and certain unallocated corporate expenses 
previously  the company evaluated operating segment performance based upon gross profit 
operating income loss and gross profit for prior periods by segment is presented for comparative purposes 
unallocated corporate expenses represent primarily compensation and benefits for certain executive officers and all costs related to being a public company 
segment assets include assets used in the operation of each segment and consist of accounts receivable  inventories  and property  plant and equipment 
the company no longer allocates goodwill to its operating segments for the purposes of evaluating operating performance 
the company s net sales for fiscal decreased  with sales decreasing substantially in the upholstery fabrics segment and remaining essentially flat in the mattress fabrics segment when compared to fiscal the company reported a net loss of million  or per share diluted  which included restructuring and related charges of million and million of goodwill impairment related to the upholstery fabrics segment 
the overall sales decline was attributable to continued softness in the company s domestically produced upholstery fabrics business  resulting primarily from the current consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and the growing competition from imported fabrics and cut and sewn kits  primarily from china 
in addition to the restructuring and related charges and goodwill impairment that lowered operating income in fiscal  the company s financial performance was further impacted by higher raw material costs  the underutilization of the company s us manufacturing capacity and manufacturing variances related to the restructuring actions in the upholstery fabrics segment  and industry wide pricing pressure in the mattress fabrics segment 
the company is taking aggressive steps to address the challenges facing both of its segments 
during fiscal  the company initiated two major restructuring initiatives in the upholstery fabrics segment  both of which are designed to bring us manufacturing capacity in line with demand  reduce costs  increase asset utilization and improve profits 
in addition  the company has identified opportunities to reduce cost in its mattress fabrics segment by consolidating mattress ticking operations 
in an effort to offset the loss in sales of us produced upholstery fabric products  the company is working on several initiatives to source and market upholstery fabric produced internationally  primarily from asia 
these measures are part of the company s continuing efforts to meet demand from consumers for certain types of fabrics  as well as serve the growing segment of the company s customer base that is establishing or expanding production in international areas 
as a result of the company s offshore efforts  including its china platform  the company is experiencing higher sales of upholstery fabrics products produced outside the company s us manufacturing plants  a trend that is expected to continue

compared with the company s net sales for fiscal decreased to million  and the company reported a net loss of million  or per share diluted  versus net income of million  or per share diluted  in fiscal restructuring and related charges of million and goodwill impairment of million were included in the net loss for fiscal in addition  restructuring credits of million and an early extinguishment of debt charge of million were included in net income for fiscal during fiscal  the company began two major restructuring initiatives 
a detailed explanation of each plan is presented in the restructuring and related charges and goodwill impairment sections below 
the total charges incurred for both restructuring initiatives were million  of which million related to goodwill impairment 
of the total charges  million was recorded in restructuring expense  million was recorded in goodwill impairment  and  was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income loss  and million was recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of income loss 
restructuring and related charges and goodwill impairment october upholstery fabrics in october  management and the board of directors approved a restructuring plan within the upholstery fabrics segment aimed at reducing costs  increasing asset utilization and improving profitability 
due to continued pressure on demand in this segment  management decided to adjust the company s cost structure and bring us manufacturing capacity in line with demand 
the restructuring plan principally involved consolidation of the company s decorative fabrics weaving operations by closing culp s facility in pageland  south carolina  and consolidating those operations into the graham  north carolina facility 
additionally  the company consolidated its yarn operations by integrating the production of the cherryville  north carolina plant into the company s shelby  north carolina facility 
another element of the restructuring plan was a substantial reduction in certain raw material and finished goods stock keeping units  or skus  to reduce manufacturing complexities and lower costs  with the ongoing objective of identifying and eliminating products that were not generating acceptable volumes of margins 
finally  the company made reductions in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
overall  these restructuring actions reduced the number of associates by approximately people  representing approximately percent of culp s upholstery fabrics segment employees 
during fiscal  the total restructuring and related charges incurred for this restructuring initiative were million  of which approximately million related to accelerated depreciation associated with the plant and equipment disposed of  either by sale or by abandonment  and inventory mark downs  million of goodwill impairment  which represented all of the remaining goodwill associated with the upholstery fabrics segment  million related to the dismantling  moving  and relocation of equipment to other company facilities  million related to write downs of buildings and equipment  and  related to employee termination costs 
from this restructuring initiative  the company expects to realize annual savings of approximately million  of which approximately million will be in fixed manufacturing costs  an estimated million in variable manufacturing costs  and approximately million in selling  general and administrative costs 
april upholstery fabrics in april  management and the board of directors approved a restructuring plan within the upholstery fabrics segment designed to reduce costs  increase asset utilization  and improve profitability 
the restructuring plan includes consolidation of the company s velvet fabrics manufacturing operations  additional fixed manufacturing cost reductions in the decorative fabrics operation  and significant reductions in selling  general  and administrative expenses within the upholstery fabrics segment 
another element of the restructuring plan will be a substantial reduction in raw material and finished goods stock keeping units or skus  to simplify manufacturing processes  increase productivity and reduce inventories 
the company is in the process of relocating velvet production equipment from the manufacturing facility in burlington  north carolina  to its other velvet plant in anderson  south carolina  resulting in significant reduction of fixed manufacturing costs 
the burlington facility will then be utilized as an inspection and distribution facility for fabrics imported from offshore sources and for finished goods warehousing of domestically produced upholstery fabrics 
the company has also combined its sales  design  and customer service activities for culp decorative fabrics and culp velvets prints  the two divisions within the upholstery fabrics segment  and has closed its stand alone design center  also in burlington 
as a result  on june  the company sold two buildings  both located in burlington  consisting of approximately  square feet 
once fully implemented  these initiatives will significantly reduce the company s selling  general  and administrative expenses 
overall  this restructuring action will reduce the number of employees by people  representing approximately percent of those in culp s domestic upholstery fabrics segment 
the implementation of this restructuring initiative began in early may  and is on schedule to be completed by august  during fiscal  the total restructuring and related charges incurred for this restructuring initiative were million  of which approximately million related to write downs of building and equipment  million related to employee termination costs   related to accelerated depreciation associated with the plant and equipment scheduled to be disposed of  either by sale or by abandonment  and inventory mark downs  and  related to lease termination costs 
as a result of this restructuring initiative  the company expects to achieve annual savings of million  of which approximately million will come from lower selling  general and administrative costs and million will come from lower fixed manufacturing costs 
mattress fabrics segment net sales for fiscal  the mattress fabrics segment reported sales of million compared with million for fiscal mattress fabrics sales represented approximately of total sales for fiscal  up from in fiscal mattress ticking yards sold during fiscal were million compared with million yards sold last fiscal year  an increase of 
this increase in yards sold is noteworthy because it occurred as the bedding industry completed the transition to selling predominantly one sided mattresses  which utilize about one third less mattress ticking 
this transition at retail began in mid to late calendar year and affected sales on a comparable basis through early calendar the average selling price for mattress ticking was per yard compared to per yard last fiscal year  a decrease of 
the mattress fabrics segment has faced a challenging pricing environment this fiscal year 
this has been due in part to the way customers buy ticking 
there is a current trend among mattress manufacturers toward using common sku s and less expensive fabric for borders  which is the ticking that goes on the side of mattresses and box springs 
in addition  mattress manufacturers are currently incurring higher costs for other mattress components  such as steel  as well as costs associated with flame retardant requirements 
as a result of these increased costs  mattress manufacturers are placing additional pressure on mattress ticking prices  and in some instances manufacturers are moving to lower priced ticking 
operating income for fiscal  the mattress fabrics segment reported operating income of million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  for fiscal during fiscal  operating income was affected by industry wide pricing pressure  as well as higher raw material costs due primarily to the increased cost of petroleum based products 
in addition to these pressures  operating income was affected by lower margins on closeout sales and manufacturing variances related to the relocation of mattress ticking looms 
the company is taking aggressive steps to address the challenges facing its business in this segment 
first  the company has identified opportunities to reduce operating costs by consolidating mattress ticking operations 
this million capital project involves relocation of ticking looms from an upholstery fabric plant to existing ticking facilities in the us and canada and the purchase of new weaving machines that are faster and more efficient than the equipment they will replace 
this transition is well underway and is expected to be completed as planned by august more importantly  this transition is expected to generate million in annual savings 
second  to partially offset higher material costs  the company implemented a price increase of approximately three percent in this segment during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year 
lastly  the company is placing more design emphasis on new products with higher margins 
management believes the steps being taken will help this segment improve operating margins 
segment assets segment assets consist of accounts receivable  inventory and property  plant and equipment 
as of may   accounts receivable and inventory totaled million  compared to million at the end of fiscal also as of may   property  plant and equipment totaled million  compared to million at the end of fiscal included in property  plant and equipment are assets located in the us totaling million and million at may  and may   respectively 
upholstery fabrics segment net sales upholstery fabric sales for fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal upholstery fabric yards sold during fiscal were million versus million in fiscal  a decline of 
average selling price was per yard for fiscal compared with per yard in fiscal the lower sales dollars and yards reflect continued soft demand industry wide for us produced fabrics  as the result of the current consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and the growing competition from imported fabrics and cut and sewn kits  primarily from china 
this paradigm shift in the industry is having a significant impact on the company s product mix  leading to significantly lower sales of domestically produced fabrics and rapidly growing sales of offshore manufactured and sourced products 
given these factors  it is difficult for management to predict demand for upholstery fabric manufactured in the us or the extent to which the trend toward lower demand will continue 
the company has undertaken several initiatives to source and market upholstery fabrics produced internationally  primarily in asia 
these measures are part of the company s continuing efforts to meet consumer preferences for certain types of fabrics  as well as to serve the growing segment of the company s customer base that is establishing or expanding furniture production in international areas 
as a result of the company s production and offshore sourcing efforts  including the china platform  the company is experiencing higher sales of upholstery fabric products produced outside of the company s us manufacturing plants for fiscal for fiscal  these sales increased over the prior year and accounted for approximately million or of upholstery fabric sales in fiscal fabric produced offshore of million accounted for approximately of upholstery fabric sales for fiscal the growth in offshore produced fabrics is a trend that is expected to continue 
a major component of the company s offshore business is its china operation  which began manufacturing operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal this initiative involves a strategy to link the company s existing customer relationships  design expertise and production technology with low cost fabric manufacturing in china  while continuing to maintain high quality standards 
the company is currently leasing two facilities in the shanghai region of china  where fabrics sourced in asia are inspected and tested to assure compliance with the company s quality standards before shipment to its customers 
in most cases  additional value added finishing steps are applied to the fabrics in china before shipment 
the company s offshore business represents a significant growth opportunity in an increasing global furniture and fabrics market place 
the company s us customers have continued to move an increasing amount of their fabric purchases  including cut and sewn kits  to china  and the company is in position to meet their fabric needs 
operating income loss operating loss for fiscal was million or of sales  compared with operating income of million  or of sales  for fiscal this significant decrease in segment operating income as compared to last year was primarily due to further underutilization of the company s us manufacturing capacity and manufacturing variances related to restructuring activities 
additionally  the upholstery fabrics segment has been experiencing higher raw material costs due mainly to the increase in cost of petroleum based products 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  solutia  which was the company s supplier for acrylic fiber  exited the acrylic fiber business 
in response to this event  the company identified certain international suppliers as alternative sources for procuring acrylic fiber 
however  in transitioning away from using solutia  the company incurred higher fiber costs and increased inventory levels 
to partially offset higher raw material prices  the company implemented a price increase of approximately three to four percent on domestically produced upholstery fabrics 
as previously discussed  the company is currently implementing aggressive restructuring initiatives to address the significant decline in operating profit in this segment 
the restructuring initiatives are moving ahead as planned and management believes that the steps taken will improve operating efficiency and will result in higher asset utilization 
however  management will continue to closely monitor trends in demand for upholstery fabrics produced by its domestic mills 
if sales in the upholstery fabrics segment of us produced goods continue to decline and the segment is not able to produce acceptable levels of operating profit  the company will take additional actions to adjust its cost structure and capacity to match demand from its customers 
the company could experience additional write downs of its property  plant and equipment in this business if further restructuring actions or consolidations of assets take place 
segment assets segment assets consist of accounts receivable  inventory and property  plant and equipment 
as of may   accounts receivable and inventory totaled million  compared to million at the end of fiscal also as of may   property  plant and equipment totaled million  compared to million at the end of fiscal included in property  plant and equipment are assets located in the us totaling million and million for may  and may   respectively 
the total of million includes allocations of million for the distribution facility and design center  both of which were sold in june  and various other corporate allocations totaling million 
other corporate expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses of million for fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a expenses decreased to from in fiscal  due mostly to lower incentive compensation expense and significant cost reductions  mainly in the sales and marketing expense areas 
the spending decrease was achieved despite significantly higher professional fees  which included significant expenses incurred to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of interest expense income interest expense for fiscal declined to million from million in fiscal due to lower borrowings outstanding 
interest income decreased to  from  in fiscal due to lower invested balances in fiscal income taxes the effective tax rate taxes as a percentage of pretax income loss for fiscal was compared with for fiscal as of may   the company has net deferred income tax assets of million  an increase of million over net deferred income tax assets of million recorded at the fiscal year ended may  this increase results primarily from the federal and state tax benefits recorded for the loss from us operations for fiscal see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
compared with the company s net sales for fiscal decreased to million  and the company reported net income of million  or per share diluted  versus a net loss before cumulative effect of accounting change of  or per share diluted  in fiscal including the cumulative effect of accounting change  the company reported a loss of per share diluted for fiscal restructuring credits of million and an early extinguishment of debt charge of million were included in net income for fiscal in addition  restructuring and related charges and credits of million were included in net loss for fiscal the company reported substantial improvement in its consolidated balance sheet by reducing long term debt by million during fiscal  and ended the year with million in cash and cash equivalents 
mattress fabrics segment net sales mattress ticking sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal  due principally to overall improved industry demand and continued gains with key customers 
the fiscal year sales gain in this segment was especially noteworthy because it occurred during the bedding industry s transition to selling predominantly one sided mattresses  which utilize approximately less mattress ticking 
mattress ticking yards sold during fiscal were million compared with million yards in the previous year  an increase of 
the average selling price was per yard for fiscal  compared to per yard in fiscal this slight reduction in average selling price was due primarily to greater participation in cash discount terms 
operating income operating income for fiscal was million or of net sales  compared with operating income of million or of net sales for fiscal this decrease in segment operating income compared to last year was primarily due lower average selling prices offset by improved operating efficiencies 
upholstery fabrics segment net sales upholstery fabric sales for fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal  primarily reflecting a decline in sales in the culp decorative fabrics division related to consumer preference for leather and competition from imported fabrics  including cut and sewn kits  primarily from china 
upholstery fabric yards sold during fiscal were million versus million in fiscal  a decline of 
average selling price was per yard for fiscal compared with per yard in fiscal  an increase of  due primarily to higher average selling prices in the culp decorative fabrics division 
operating income operating income for fiscal was million or of net sales  compared with operating income of million or of net sales 
this significant decrease in operating income as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decline in sales in the culp decorative fabrics division related to consumer preference for leather and competition from imported fabrics  including cut and sewn kits  primarily from china 
the company substantially increased its offshore sourcing of fabrics in fiscal  increasing the proportion of upholstery fabrics from offshore to compared to in fiscal a major component of this offshore sourcing effort is the company s china operation  which was announced in march and began operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal as expected  the company experienced moderate operating losses in its china operations in fiscal other corporate expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses were million for fiscal and increased million  or  from fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a expenses increased to from in fiscal this increase over the prior year was due primarily to higher professional fees coupled with lower sales 
additionally  sg a expenses in fiscal included a credit to bad debt expense in the amount of  due to a significant decrease in past due receivable balances 
restructuring credit expense the fiscal million restructuring credit resulted from the adjustment of accrued employee benefit and other plant closing costs related to the shutdown of the company s chattanooga and lumberton operations 
the fiscal million restructuring expense represents million of restructuring expenses related to cdf for lease termination expenses and personnel costs  million of restructuring expenses related to write downs of equipment in connection with the wet printed flock business by cvp  offset by a restructuring credit of  for over accrued employee benefit and plat security costs 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal declined to million from million due to significantly lower borrowings outstanding 
interest income interest income for fiscal decreased to  from  due to lower interest rates earned in fiscal and lower invested balances 
early extinguishment of debt the million charge incurred in fiscal represents premium and fees paid to reduce the million term loan balance 
other expense other expense for fiscal totaled  compared with  in fiscal the decrease was principally due to lower debt issue amortization expenses 
income taxes the effective tax rate taxes as a percentage of pretax income loss for fiscal was compared with for fiscal the higher rate for the prior period reflects the increased tax benefits related to the company s loss in the us resulting from the restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal handling costs the company records warehousing costs in selling  general administrative expenses 
these costs were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
warehousing costs include the operating expenses of the company s various finished goods distribution centers  such as personnel costs  utilities  building rent and material handling equipment lease expense 
had these costs been included in cost of sales  gross profit would have been million  or in fiscal  million  or in fiscal and million  or in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and amounts available under its revolving credit line 
these sources have been adequate for day to day operations and capital expenditures 
the company believes its sources of liquidity continue to be adequate to meet its current needs 
cash and cash equivalents as of may  decreased to million from million at the end of fiscal  primarily reflecting cash flow from operations of million  capital expenditures and payments on vendor financed capital expenditures of million  and payments on long term debt of  working capital accounts receivable as of may  decreased from may   principally due to lower sales volume 
the accounts payable balance as of may  increased from may   primarily due to increased inventory purchases and capital expenditures related to the mattress fabrics capital project 
days sales outstanding totaled days at may  and may  inventories at the end of the fiscal year increased from a year ago 
inventory turns for the year were versus for the year earlier period 
operating working capital comprised of accounts receivable and inventories  less trade accounts payable was million at may  down from million at may  financing arrangements the company s long term debt of million is unsecured and is comprised of million in outstanding senior notes  with a fixed interest rate of payable semi annually in march and september  and a  non interest bearing term loan with the canadian government 
additionally  the company has a million revolving credit line with a bank 
borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at the london interbank offered rate plus an adjustable margin based on the company s debt ebitda ratio  as defined by the agreement 
as of may   there was million in outstanding letters of credit in support of inventory purchases and no borrowings outstanding under the agreement 
the current bank agreement expires in august the first scheduled principal payment on the million senior notes is due march in the amount of million 
the final payment on the canadian government loan is due during the company s third quarter of fiscal the company was in compliance with all financial covenants in its loan agreements as of may  in february  the company amended its bank agreement with its lender to change the interest and leases coverage ratio such that at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning with the third fiscal quarter of fiscal year  the interest and leases coverage ratio shall not be less than to in december  the company amended its bank agreement with its lender to provide for  among other things  a reduced revolving loan commitment of million from an existing commitment of million  including new letters of credits up to million commitments the following table summarizes the company s contractual payment obligations and commitments in thousands thereafter total capital expenditure commitments   accounts payable capital expenditures   operating leases     long term debt       total       note payment obligations by fiscal year ending april includes accrued restructuring expenses for the company s inactive chattanooga manufacturing facility of for fiscal   and  respectively 
capital expenditures capital spending for fiscal was million  including million that is the non cash portion of capital expenditures representing vendor financing 
also included in the million was approximately million in capital spending for the purchase of a building that serves as the company s new corporate offices and as new space for the company s showrooms 
the company expects the annual operating costs of the new building to be significantly lower than the lease and related costs associated with the facilities that have been replaced by this new building 
also included in the million was million in capital spending related to the mattress fabrics capital project 
depreciation for fiscal was million  of which approximately million was related to accelerated depreciation associated with plant and equipment that has been disposed of or is scheduled to be disposed of  either by sale or abandonment  over the next three months 
the company s capital budget for fiscal is million  including approximately million budgeted for the non cash portion of expenditures representing vendor financing  which relates to the mattress fabrics capital project 
inflation the cost of certain of the company s raw materials  principally fibers from petroleum derivatives  and utility energy costs  increased during fiscal as oil and other energy prices increased and had an impact on the company s financial results  although these increases have moderated in recent months 
these increases  however  are often not directly related to general economic inflation  which has not been a material factor in the company s recent financial results 
any significant increase in general economic inflation could have a material adverse impact on the company  however  because competitive conditions have limited the company s ability to pass significant operating cost increases on to its customers 
critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable are due from residential and commercial furniture and bedding manufacturers 
ownership of these manufacturers is increasingly concentrated and certain bedding manufacturers have a high degree of leverage 
as of may   accounts receivable from furniture manufacturers totaled approximately million  and from bedding manufacturers approximately million 
additionally  as of may   the aggregate accounts receivable balance of the company s ten largest customers was million  or of trade accounts receivable 
the company continuously performs credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs including customers financial position  past payment history  cash flows and management capability  historical loss experience  and economic conditions and prospects 
once evaluated  each customer is assigned a credit grade 
credit grades are adjusted as warranted 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used in connection with establishing the reserve for allowance for doubtful accounts 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that the company could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
inventory valuation 
the company operates as a make to order and make to stock business 
although management closely monitors demand in each product area to decide which patterns and styles to hold in inventory  the increasing availability of low cost imports and the gradual shifts in consumer preferences expose the company to write downs of inventory 
management continually examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value 
experience has shown that the most significant indicator of the need for inventory write downs is the age of the inventory 
as a result  the company provides inventory valuation write downs based upon set percentages for inventory aging categories  generally using six  nine  twelve and fifteen month categories 
while management believes that adequate write downs for excess and obsolete inventory have been made in the consolidated financial statements  significant unanticipated changes in demand or changes in consumer tastes and preferences could result in additional excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
long lived assets 
the company follows the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes an impairment accounting model for long lived assets to be held and used  disposed of by sale  or disposed of by abandonment or other means 
management reviews long lived assets  which consists of property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
in fiscal  the company prepared impairment evaluations on its culp decorative fabrics and culp velvets prints divisions due to continued adverse business results requiring further restructuring of both businesses 
the company s assessment indicated that the net undiscounted future operating cash flows of these businesses were sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived assets to be held and used 
the determination of future operating cash flows involves considerable estimation and judgment about future market conditions  future sales and profitability  and future asset utilization 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions  or a decision to dispose of substantial portions of these assets  could result in materially different results 
goodwill 
as of april   culp adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
for the initial application of sfas no 
 an independent business valuation specialist was engaged to assist the company in the determination of the fair market value of culp decorative fabrics  one of the company s two divisions within the upholstery fabric segment  because of the significance of the goodwill associated with the division and due to its operating performance 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a non operating  non cash goodwill impairment charge of million million net of taxes of million  or per share diluted  related to the goodwill associated with the culp decorative fabrics division 
in october  due to lower than expected operating profits and cash flow for the second quarter and year to date for fiscal in the upholstery fabrics segment  management determined that the remaining goodwill associated with this segment should be tested for impairment 
an independent business valuation specialist was once again engaged to assist the company in the valuation 
as a result of this valuation  the company recorded in its second quarter of fiscal a goodwill impairment charge of million million net of taxes  or per share diluted 
as of may   the company s remaining million of goodwill relates to the culp home fashions division 
the determination of fair value involves considerable estimation and judgment 
in particular  determining the fair value of a business unit involves  among other things  developing forecasts of future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
restructuring charges 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under sfas  a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for certain employee termination benefits that qualify under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
the upholstery fabric industry continues to be under significant pressure from a variety of external forces  such as the current consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and the growing competition from imported fabrics and cut and sewn kits  primarily from china 
in an effort to reduce operating expenses and scale us productive capacity in line with demand  the company has undertaken restructuring initiatives during the past several years 
these restructuring initiatives have resulted in restructuring charges related to the remaining lease costs of the closed facilities  the write down of property  plant and equipment  workforce reduction and elimination of facilities 
severance and related charges are accrued at the date the restructuring was approved by the board of directors based on an estimate of amounts that will be paid to affected employees  in accordance with sfas under sfas  asset impairment charges related to the consolidation or closure of manufacturing facilities are based on an estimate of expected sales prices for the real estate and equipment 
other exit costs  which principally consist of charges for lease termination and losses from termination of existing contracts  equipment relocation costs and inventory markdowns that are related to the restructuring are accounted for in accordance with sfas the company reassesses the individual accrual requirements at the end of each reporting period 
if circumstances change  causing current estimates to differ from original estimates  adjustments are recorded in the period of change 
restructuring charges  and adjustments of those charges  are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
the company is required to estimate its actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
at may   the company had deferred tax assets of  all of which are related to us operations and deferred tax liabilities of  resulting in net deferred tax assets of  the us deferred tax liabilities total  all of which reverse in the carry forward period  resulting in net us deferred tax assets of  no valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the company s deferred tax assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
the company s exposure to floating debt interest rate risk was eliminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal after its remaining industrial revenue bonds were paid 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is due primarily to a foreign subsidiary domiciled in canada and firmly committed and anticipated purchases of certain machinery  equipment and raw materials in foreign currencies 
the company s canadian subsidiary uses the united states dollar as its functional currency 
the company generally does not use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with the canadian subsidiary 
however  the company generally enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts as a hedge against its exposure to currency fluctuations on firmly committed and anticipated purchases of certain machinery  equipment and raw materials 
the amount of canadian denominated sales and manufacturing costs is not material to the company s consolidated results of operations  therefore  a change in the exchange rate at may  would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
the company does have exposure to fluctuations in currency rates if china allows their currency to float since it has been essentially fixed in relation to the us dollar 
currently  the risk cannot be hedged 
the amount of sales and manufacturing costs denominated in chinese currency is not material to the company s consolidated results of operations  therefore  a change in the exchange rate at may  would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
