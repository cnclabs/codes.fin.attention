item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a description of a number of factors that could adversely affect our results 
business segments we manage our business with two segments commercial and government 
the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals  and includes three lines of business fully insured medical  administrative services only  or aso  and specialty 
the government segment consists of members enrolled in government sponsored programs  and includes three lines of business medicare advantage  medicaid  and tricare 
we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business 
the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics 
these characteristics include the nature of customer groups  pricing  benefits  and underwriting requirements 
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes 
we allocate all selling  general and administrative expenses  investment and other income  interest expense  and goodwill  but no other assets or liabilities  to our segments 
members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks  enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers 
our segments also share overhead costs and assets 
as a result  the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

table of contents our products the following table presents our segment membership  premiums and aso fees by product for the year ended december  medical membership specialty membership premiums aso fees total premiums and aso fees percent of total premiums and aso fees dollars in thousands commercial fully insured hmo ppo total fully insured administrative services only specialty total commercial government medicare advantage medicaid tricare tricare aso total government total our products marketed to commercial segment employers and members consumer directed products over the last several years  we have developed and offered various commercial products designed to provide options and choices to employers that are annually facing substantial premium increases driven by double digit medical cost inflation 
these consumer directed products  which can be offered on either a fully insured or self funded basis  provided coverage to approximately  members at december   representing approximately of our total commercial medical membership 
these products are often offered to employer groups as bundles  where the subscribers are offered various hmo and ppo options  with various employer contribution strategies as determined by the customer 
paramount to our consumer directed product strategy  we have developed a group of innovative consumer products  styled as smart products  that we believe will be a long term solution for employers 
this new generation of products provides more choices for the individual consumer  transparency of provider costs  and benefit designs that engage consumers in the costs and effectiveness of health care choices 
innovative tools and technology are available to assist consumers with these decisions  including the trade offs between higher premiums and point of service costs at the time consumers choose their plans  and to suggest ways in which the consumers can maximize their individual benefits at the point they use their plans 
we believe that when consumers can make informed choices about the cost and effectiveness of their health care  a sustainable long term solution for employers can be realized 
in late  we introduced a smart product option on a fully insured basis only to small businesses to allow them to experience the same advantages as the larger groups in lowering health benefits costs 
smart products  which accounted for approximately of enrollment in all of our consumer directed plans  only are sold to employers with humana as the sole carrier 

table of contents some employers have selected other types of consumer directed products  such as  a product with a high deductible  a catastrophic coverage plan  or ones that offer a spending account option in conjunction with more traditional medical coverage or as a stand alone plan 
unlike our smart products  these products  while valuable in helping employers deal with near term cost increases by shifting costs to employees  are not considered long term comprehensive solutions to the employers cost dilemma by us  although we view this as an initial interim step 
hmo our health maintenance organization  or hmo  products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians  specialty physicians  and other health care providers who contract with the hmo to furnish such services 
primary care physicians generally include internists  family practitioners  and pediatricians 
generally  the member s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers 
these other health care providers include  among others  hospitals  nursing homes  home health agencies  pharmacies  mental health and substance abuse centers  diagnostic centers  optometrists  outpatient surgery centers  dentists  urgent care centers  and durable medical equipment suppliers 
because the primary care physician generally must approve access to many of these other health care providers  the hmo product is considered the most restrictive form of a health benefit plan 
an hmo member  typically through the member s employer  pays a monthly fee  which generally covers  together with some copayments  health care services received from or approved by the member s primary care physician 
for the year ended december   commercial hmo premium revenues totaled approximately billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
ppo our preferred provider organization  or ppo  products  which are marketed primarily to commercial groups and individuals  include some elements of managed health care 
however  they typically include more cost sharing with the member  through copayments and annual deductibles 
ppos also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider 
in a ppo  the member is encouraged  through financial incentives  to use participating health care providers  which have contracted with the ppo to provide services at favorable rates 
in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider  the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider s fees 
in june  we introduced humanaone  a major medical product marketed directly to individuals 
we introduced this product in select markets where we can both underwrite risk and utilize our existing networks and distribution channels 
this product includes provisions mandated by law to guarantee renewal of coverage 
for the year ended december   commercial and individual ppo premium revenues totaled approximately billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
administrative services only we also offer administrative services only  or aso  products to employers who self insure their employee health plans 
we receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims  offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs  and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self funded employers 
these products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully insured ppo  hmo or consumer directed products described above 
under aso contracts  self funded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits 
however  most aso customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs 
accordingly  we have recorded premiums and medical expenses related to these stop loss arrangements 
for the year ended december   commercial aso fees totaled million  or of our total premiums and aso fees 

table of contents specialty products we additionally offer various specialty products including dental  group and individual life  and short term disability 
at december   we had approximately million specialty members  including million dental members 
for the year ended december   specialty product premium revenues were approximately million  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
our products marketed to government segment members and beneficiaries medicare advantage products medicare is a federal program that provides persons age and over and some disabled persons under the age of certain hospital and medical insurance benefits 
hospitalization benefits are provided under part a  without the payment of any premium  for up to days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating days 
eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b 
beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional medicare are still required to pay out of pocket deductibles and coinsurance 
we contract with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  under the medicare advantage program to provide health insurance benefits to medicare eligible persons under hmo  ppo and private fee for service  or pffs  plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms 
with each of these products the beneficiary generally receives benefits in excess of traditional medicare  typically including a prescription drug benefit  a reduced monthly premium  or reduced cost sharing 
medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicare covered services or for certain extra benefits 
beginning in  medicare beneficiaries will have a prescription drug benefit  and most medicare advantage plans must offer that benefit as part of the basic plan 
for our medicare hmo and ppo plans  we contract with cms to provide health insurance benefits in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member for medicare eligible individuals residing in defined counties 
individuals who elect to participate in these plans receive benefits in excess of traditional medicare 
these benefits typically include a prescription drug benefit  subject to cost sharing and some limitations 
additionally  these benefits may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating in network providers  or in emergency situations 
except in emergency situations  hmo plans provide no out of network benefits 
ppo plans carry an out of network benefit that is subject to higher member cost sharing 
in many cases  these beneficiaries also may be required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan  in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 
for our medicare pffs plans  we contract with cms to offer health benefits to eligible medicare beneficiaries in certain states in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member 
under these plans  we offer a prescription drug benefit  subject to cost sharing and other limitations 
other health care benefits also may be different than traditional medicare 
individuals in these plans pay a monthly premium to receive these enhanced prescription drug benefits 
unlike the hmo and ppo plans  these plans have no preferred network 
medicare uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to managed care plans 
in the last decade  congress has made several changes to how cms must calculate these rates 
the old pre methodology was based on the adjusted average per capita cost methodology  or aapcc 
under aapcc  cms projected average county level fee for service spending for the coming year to set the reimbursement rates for medicare health plans at percent of the full aapcc amount 
under the aapcc system  payment rates per county varied widely 
for example  the capitation rate for beneficiaries and older for part a and part b services ranged from a low of in arthur county  nebraska to a high of in richmond county  staten island  new york 
some states saw differences of more than percent between adjacent counties 
since county fee for service costs were used to estimate county managed care capitation rates  the rates reflected differences among counties and regions in fee for service utilization patterns and cost structures 

table of contents in the balanced budget act of bba  congress created a new rate setting methodology  eliminating the direct link in the aapcc method between managed care rates and local fee for service costs 
congress broke the direct link by requiring that each year a county rate was the highest of three types of rates  each calculated differently than the old aapcc rate 
as a result  the wide disparities in county capitation rates were reduced by bringing both high and low payment rates closer to the national average 
additionally  the bba required cms to implement a risk adjustment payment system for medicare health plans 
risk adjustment uses health status indicators to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for plans to enroll and treat less healthy medicare beneficiaries 
cms initially phased in this payment methodology with a risk adjustment model that based payment on principal hospital inpatient diagnoses  as well as demographic factors such as gender  age  and medicaid eligibility 
from to  risk adjusted payment accounted for only percent of medicare health plans payment  with the remaining percent being based on demographic factors described above 
pursuant to the benefits and improvements protection act of bipa  cms implemented a new risk adjustment model that uses additional diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits 
cms has also redesigned its data collection and processing system to further reduce administrative data burden on medicare health plans 
in  the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to percent  from percent in the phase in of risk adjusted payment will be completed in  the portion of risk adjusted payment will increase to percent in and percent in under the new risk adjustment methodology  humana and all managed care organizations must capture  collect  and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms twice a year 
as a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment methodology described above  our cms monthly payments per member may change materially  either favorably or unfavorably 
over the five year period beginning january  and ending december   our annual increases in per member premiums from cms have ranged from as low as approximately to as high as approximately  with an average of approximately 
during  we experienced average overall increases in per member premiums in the range of to 
we are expecting a similar level of increase during at december   we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately  medicare advantage members for which we received premium revenues of approximately billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees for one such cms contract covered approximately  members in south florida and accounted for premium revenues of approximately billion  which represented of our medicare advantage premium revenues  or of our total premiums and aso fees for additionally  on february  we acquired careplus health plans of florida  adding approximately  medicare advantage hmo members to our south florida operations 
our hmo  ppo and pffs products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed for a one year term each december unless notice of termination is received at least days prior thereto 
no termination notices were received in connection with our currently existing plans 
additionally  in  we have established medicare pffs plans in eleven states and  have recently established medicare ppo plans in many of our existing markets where we have established competitive provider networks 
we continue to evaluate additional states and local markets where we believe we can be competitive with these products  and we anticipate further expansion during medicaid product medicaid is a federal program that is state operated to facilitate the delivery of health care services to low income residents 
each electing state develops  through a state specific regulatory agency  a medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms 
cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable fee for service basis 
states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program 
in either case  the contractual 
table of contents relationship with a state generally is for a one year period 
under these contracts  we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members 
due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints  more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 
we currently have medicaid contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration through june  our other medicaid contracts are in florida and illinois  and are annual contracts 
for the year ended december   premium revenues from our medicaid products totaled million  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
at december   we had approximately  medicaid members in puerto rico  or of total medicaid members  and  medicaid members in florida and illinois  or of total medicaid members 
tricare tricare provides health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents 
currently  three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries 
in addition to a traditional indemnity option  participants may enroll in an hmo like plan with a point of service option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers 
we have participated in the tricare program since under contracts with the united states department of defense 
our current tricare south region contract  which we were awarded in  covers approximately million eligible beneficiaries in florida  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  alabama  tennessee  louisiana  arkansas  texas and oklahoma 
the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense 
the tricare south region contract is for a five year period subject to annual renewals at the federal government s option  with the second option period scheduled to begin april  we have subcontracted with third parties to provide selected administration and specialty services under the contract 
during  we completed a contractual transition of our tricare business 
on july   our regions and contract servicing approximately million tricare members became part of the new north region  which was awarded to another contractor 
on august   our regions and contract became part of our new south region contract 
on november   the region contract  previously administered by the same contractor  with approximately million members  became part of the south region contract 
the members added with the region contract essentially offset the members lost four months earlier with the regions and contract 
for the year ended december   tricare premium revenues were approximately billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
at december   we had  tricare aso members representing active duty beneficiaries  seniors over the age of and beneficiaries in puerto rico for which the department of defense retains all of the risk of financing the cost of their health benefit 
part of the tricare transition during included the carve out of the tricare senior pharmacy and tricare for life program which we previously administered 
on june  and august   administrative services under these programs were transferred to another contractor 
for the year ended december   tricare administrative services fees totaled million  or of our total premiums and aso fees

we have approximately  contracts with health care providers participating in our networks  which consist of approximately  physicians   hospitals  and  ancillary providers and dentists 
these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services  medical equipment services  home health agencies  mental health providers  rehabilitation facilities  nursing homes  optical services  and pharmacies 
our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 
we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members 
these techniques include the coordination of care for our members  product and benefit designs  hospital inpatient management systems and enrolling members into various disease management programs 
the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care physician who  under contract  provides services  and may control utilization of appropriate services  by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers 
some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provisions of quality patient care are met 
our hospitalist programs use specially trained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an hmo member s medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the member s discharge and post discharge care 
we have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure  coronary artery disease  prenatal and premature infant care  asthma related illness  end stage renal disease  diabetes  cancer  and certain other conditions 

table of contents we typically contract with hospitals on either a per diem rate  which is an all inclusive rate per day  a case rate or diagnosis related groups drg  which is an all inclusive rate per admission  or a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services 
outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service  ambulatory payment classifications  or apcs  or at a discounted charge 
apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment 
these contracts are often multi year agreements  with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation index 
outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 
our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year  unless either party gives written notice to the other party of their intent to terminate the arrangement 
most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule  which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 
capitation for of our december  medical membership  we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership 
in transferring this risk  we prepay these providers a monthly fixed fee per member  known as a capitation per capita payment  to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership  including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing 
for these capitated hmo arrangements  we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a medical expense ratio ranging from to 
providers participating in hospital based capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership 
providers participating in physician based capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians  and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 
for of our december  medical membership  we contract with physicians under risk sharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership 
although these arrangements do include capitation payments for services rendered  we process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 
physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis 
we monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers 
however  we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services

we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the 
table of contents health plan employer data information sets  or hedis  which is used by employers  government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance  or ncqa  to evaluate hmos based on various criteria  including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 
physicians participating in our hmo networks must satisfy specific criteria  including licensing  patient access  office standards  after hours coverage  and other factors 
most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms and or the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations  or jcaho 
recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years  depending on applicable state laws 
recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical license  review of their malpractice liability claims history  review of their board certification  if applicable  and review of any complaints  including member appeals and grievances 
committees  composed of a peer group of physicians  review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 
we request accreditation for certain of our hmo plans from ncqa and the american accreditation healthcare commission utilization review accreditation commission  or aahc urac 
accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo 
accreditation specific to the utilization review process also is required in the state of georgia for licensure as an hmo or ppo 
certain commercial businesses  like those impacted by third party labor agreements or those where a request is made by the employer  may require or prefer accredited health plans 
ncqa performs reviews of standards for quality improvement  credentialing  utilization management  and member rights and responsibilities 
we continue to maintain accreditation in select markets through ncqa 
aahc urac performs reviews for utilization management standards and for health plan and health network standards in quality management  credentialing  rights and responsibilities  and network management 
we continue to maintain urac accreditation in select markets and certain operations

sales and marketing individuals become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products  pay for all or part of the premiums  and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees 
we attempt to become an employer s or group s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo  ppo  and specialty products that provide cost effective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of the employees or members 
since june  we also offer commercial health insurance products to individuals 
we use various methods to market our commercial  medicare advantage  and medicaid products  including television  radio  the internet  telemarketing  and direct mailings 
at december   we used approximately  licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately licensed employees to sell our commercial products 
many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products 
we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums  with commissions varying by market and premium volume 
in addition to commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers  we also have programs that pay 
table of contents brokers and agents on other bases 
these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products 
we also pay additional commission based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 
at december   we employed approximately sales representatives  who are each paid a salary and or per member commission  to market our medicare advantage and medicaid products in the continental united states 
we also employed approximately telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare advantage and medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members 
risk management through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria  we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products 
in most instances  employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage 
small group reform laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions 
underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with medicare advantage products because cms regulations require us to accept all eligible medicare applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 
we also are not permitted to employ underwriting criteria for the medicaid product  but rather we follow cms and state requirements 
competition the health benefits industry is highly competitive and contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid or renewed annually 
the number of plans participating in the medicare advantage program is likely to increase due to higher payments from the government  the establishment of regional medicare advantage plans  and the introduction of new medicare ppo plans 
additionally  the impact of the new medicare bidding process  replacing the adjusted community rate acr process in  is uncertain 
our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies  national insurance companies  and other hmos and ppos  including hmos and ppos owned by blue cross blue shield plans 
many of our competitors have larger memberships and or greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete 
our ability to sell our products and to retain customers is  or may be  influenced by such factors as benefits  pricing  contract terms  number and quality of participating physicians and other providers  utilization review  claims processing  administrative efficiency  relationships with agents  quality of customer service  and accreditation results 
government regulation government regulation of health care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
the passing of the medicare modernization act of represents the most sweeping changes to medicare since the bba 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 
these regulatory revisions could affect our operations and financial results 
also  it may become increasingly difficult to control medical costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations 
enforcement of health care fraud and abuse laws has become a top priority for the nation s law enforcement entities 
the funding of such law enforcement efforts has increased dramatically in the past few years and is 
table of contents expected to continue 
the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare advantage  medicaid  and the federal employee health benefits program  or fehbp 
we participate extensively in these programs and have continued our stringent regulatory compliance efforts for these programs 
the programs are subject to very technical rules 
when combined with law enforcement intolerance for any level of noncompliance  these rules mean that compliance efforts in this area continue to be challenging 
we are subject to various governmental audits  investigations  and enforcement actions 
these include possible government actions relating to the employee retirement income security act  as amended  or erisa  fehbp  federal and state fraud and abuse laws  laws regulating anticompetitive and unfair business activities  and other laws relating to medicare advantage  including adjusted community rating development  special payment status  risk adjusted premiums and various other areas 
the cms risk adjustment methodology is described on page adjusted community rating development is the government defined rating formula used to explain the medicare advantage benefits we offer individuals eligible for medicare benefits based on a particular community and certain other factors 
special payment status refers to  among others  medicare advantage beneficiaries who are institutionalized  medicaid eligible  or members who have contracted end stage renal disease 
the medicare advantage plan receives a higher payment for members who qualify for one or more of these statuses 
on may   we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement with the office of the inspector general for the department of health and human services as part of a settlement of a medicare overpayment issue arising from an audit by the office of the inspector general 
we are also subject to substantial regulation by the states in which we do business 
we regularly are audited and subject to various enforcement actions by state departments of insurance 
these departments enforce laws relating to all aspects of our operations  including benefit offerings  marketing  claim payments and premium setting  especially with regard to our small group business 
although any of the pending government actions could result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  and other sanctions against us  including exclusion from participation in government programs  we do not believe the results of any of these actions  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
of our eight licensed and active hmo subsidiaries as of february   six are qualified under the federal health maintenance organization act of  as amended 
to obtain federal qualification  an hmo must meet certain requirements  including conformance with benefit  rating  and financial reporting standards 
federal qualification allows us to participate in the fehbp program 
in certain markets  and for certain products  we operate hmos that are not federally qualified because this provides greater flexibility with respect to product design and pricing than is possible for federally qualified hmos 
as of february   humana medical plan  inc  humana health plan of texas  inc  humana health benefit plan of louisiana  inc  and humana health plan  inc each hold cms contracts under the medicare advantage program to sell medicare hmo products in a total of seven states 
in addition  humana insurance company holds cms contracts under a medicare advantage program to sell a private fee for service product in eleven states and ppo plans in many of our existing markets 
the ppo and hmo plans are considered coordinated care plans and have similar standards 
cms conducts audits of plans qualified under its medicare advantage program at least biannually and may perform other reviews more frequently to determine compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations 
these audits include review of the plans administration and management  including management information and data collection systems  fiscal stability  utilization management and physician incentive arrangements  health services delivery  quality assurance  marketing  enrollment and disenrollment activity  claims processing  and complaint systems 
cms regulations require submission of quarterly and annual financial statements 
in addition  cms requires certain disclosures to cms and to medicare advantage beneficiaries concerning operations of a health plan 
table of contents contracted under the medicare advantage program 
cms s rules require disclosure to members upon request of information concerning financial arrangements and incentive plans between the plan and physicians in the plan s networks 
these rules also require certain levels of stop loss coverage to protect contracted physicians against major losses relating to patient care  depending on the amount of financial risk they assume 
the reporting of certain health care data contained in hedis is another important cms disclosure requirement 
our medicaid products are regulated by the applicable state agency in the state in which we sell a medicaid product and by the health insurance administration in puerto rico  in conformance with federal approval of the applicable state plan  and are subject to periodic reviews by these agencies 
the reviews are similar in nature to those performed by cms 
laws in the commonwealth of puerto rico and each of the states in which we operate our hmos  ppos and other health insurance related services regulate our operations  including the scope of benefits  rate formulas  delivery systems  utilization review procedures  quality assurance  complaint systems  enrollment requirements  claim payments  marketing  and advertising 
the hmo  ppo  and other health insurance related products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 
under state laws  our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance  and our hmos are audited for compliance with health services standards by respective state departments of health 
most states laws require such audits to be performed at least once every three years 
our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and commonwealth of puerto rico regulations 
these regulations generally require  among other things  prior approval and or notice of new products  rates  benefit changes  and certain material transactions  including dividend payments  purchases or sales of assets  intercompany agreements  and the filing of various financial and operational reports 
certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends  loans  or other cash transfers to humana inc  our parent company  require minimum levels of equity  as well as limit investments to approved securities 
the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus 
in most states  prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 
as of december   we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of  million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries 
each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated million 
although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume  product mix  and the quality of assets held  minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level 
certain states rely on risk based capital requirements  or rbc  to define the required levels of equity 
rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity s solvency 
this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels 
if rbc were adopted by all states at december   each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance and we would have million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc 
our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business 
health care reform diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives continue at both the federal and state levels to affect aspects of the nation s health care system 

table of contents federal on december   president bush signed into law the medicare modernization act of  or mma 
mma makes many significant changes to the medicare fee for service and medicare advantage programs  as well as other changes to the commercial health insurance marketplace 
most significantly  mma creates a prescription drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries beginning in  established a new medicare advantage program to replace the medicare choice program  and enacts health savings accounts  or hsas  for non medicare eligible individuals and groups 
beginning in  medicare beneficiaries will be able to sign up for a stand alone drug plan or join a private health plan under medicare advantage that offers drug coverage 
see description of our medicare advantage products beginning on page for additional discussion 
the legislation established a new medicare private health plan program  called medicare advantage  to offer regional ppo options beginning in and a continuance of hmo  point of service  ppo  and private fee for service options in defined  local service areas 
the legislation also includes a provision establishing hsa s  tax advantaged savings accounts that can be used to pay for medical expenses incurred by individuals  their spouse  and their dependents 
the use of individually identifiable data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels 
these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data 
most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa 
hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions  establishing uniform health care provider  payer  and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data 
regulations issued in february set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by april  violations of these rules could subject us to significant penalties 
compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements  training  and administrative effort 
the final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws  but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 
hipaa also could expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates 
state we continue to encounter regulation on health care claims payment practices at the state level 
this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose us to additional liability and penalties 
supplemental legislation includes  among other provisions  claims submission content and electronic submission 
we view electronic submission as a favorable development that will simplify claims interactions 
a few states are considering proposals that place new limits on insurer contacts with hospitals and physicians 
these proposals include provisions to expand payment disclosure  limit implementation of claims payment procedures  and extend an insurer payment liability where intermediaries fail to pay and restrict recoupment 
some states are proposing the creation of small employer pooled purchasing arrangements 
although these pooled purchasing arrangements may affect the small group market  most of the proposals require these purchasing arrangements to comply with the standard small group market regulations 
similar arrangements enacted in the early s had a very limited affect on the small group insurance market 
a limited number of states are considering additional restrictions on the use of health status in small group rating 
mandate free benefit plans are pending in a number of states 
some of these proposals could allow insurers more flexibility in the use of member cost sharing 
there is activity in some states supporting an expansion of disclosure by hospitals  physicians  and other health care providers of quality and charge data either directly to patients or to state agencies that must make it publicly available 

table of contents medical malpractice reform is receiving significant attention 
pending medical malpractice reform proposals differ substantially relative to the entities covered by the reforms 
since the substance of the reforms remains under discussion and the scope of covered entities has not been resolved in most states  management is unable to predict future activity under these laws 
we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted  what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed  when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other captive insurance company we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability  employee workers compensation  and officer and director errors and omissions risks 
professional and general liability risks may include  for example  medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage 
we retain these risks through our wholly owned  consolidated insurance subsidiary 
we reduce exposure to our own general business risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of third party insurance companies 
we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 
in an effort to minimize credit risk  we insure our risks with a number of insurance companies having a long history of strong financial ratings 
since january   we have reduced the amount of coverage purchased from third party insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain due to substantially higher insurance rates 
we provide a detail of the significant assets and liabilities as well as a rollforward of reserve activity related to our captive insurance subsidiary in note to the consolidated financial statements 
centralized management services we provide centralized management services to each health plan and both of our business segments from our headquarters and service centers 
these services include management information systems  product development and administration  finance  personnel  development  accounting  law  public relations  marketing  insurance  purchasing  risk management  internal audit  actuarial  underwriting  claims processing  and customer service 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees  including approximately employees covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we have good relations with our employees 
item properties we own our principal executive office  which is located in the humana building  west main street  louisville  kentucky in addition  as of december   we own buildings in louisville  kentucky  and green bay  wisconsin  and lease facilities in cincinnati  ohio and puerto rico  all of which are used for customer service  enrollment  and claims processing 
our louisville and green bay facilities also house other corporate functions 

table of contents we also own or lease administrative market offices and medical centers 
we no longer operate most of these medical centers but  rather  lease them to their provider operators 
the following table lists the location of properties we owned or leased at december  medical centers administrative offices owned leased owned leased total florida texas kentucky georgia illinois puerto rico louisiana tennessee alabama ohio wisconsin others total item legal proceedings managed care industry purported class action litigation we have been involved in several purported class action lawsuits that are part of a wave of generally similar actions that target the health care payer industry and particularly target managed care companies 
these include a lawsuit against us and originally nine of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of physicians who have treated our members 
as a result of action by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation jpml  the case was consolidated in the united states district court for the southern district of florida  and has been styled in re managed care litigation 
the plaintiffs assert that we and other defendants improperly paid providers claims and downcoded their claims by paying lesser amounts than they submitted 
the complaint alleges  among other things  multiple violations under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act  or rico  as well as various breaches of contract and violations of regulations governing the timeliness of claim payments 
the complaint was subsequently amended to add as plaintiffs several medical societies  including the texas medical association  the medical association of georgia  the california medical association  the florida medical association  and the louisiana state medical society  each of which purports to bring its action against specified defendants 
on september   the court certified a global class consisting of all medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by any defendant from august   to september  the class included two subclasses 
a national subclass consisted of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by a defendant when the doctor had a claim against such defendant and was not required to arbitrate that claim 
a california subclass consisted of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured in california by any defendant when the doctor was not bound to arbitrate the claim 
on september   the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit eleventh circuit agreed with the district court s ruling as to the class for the rico claims  although it suggested that the class should be split so that claims involving capitation and fee for service payments would be handled separately 
however  it reversed the lower court as to state law claims  including breach of contract  unjust enrichment and violations of prompt pay laws 
it found that the state claims were too individualized to be dealt with in a class action 
the california subclass was not specifically challenged and therefore was permitted to remain 
on october   the defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court  asking for review of the eleventh circuit s decision 
the petition was denied on january  
table of contents on december   the court issued an order rescheduling the trial for september  on february   the court ruled that the trial would be bifurcated so that the issue of liability would be tried first  followed by proof of damages  if liability is found 
meanwhile  on september   the plaintiffs filed an amended motion for class certification  seeking a global fee for service class and five subclasses for the time period from january   to the date of certification 
the global class would consist of any medical doctor who provided service on a fee for service basis to any person insured by cigna corporation or any other defendant for claims of rico conspiracy and aiding and abetting 
the motion seeks subclasses for the conspiracy counts for capitation damages and capitation injunctive relief consisting of all medical doctors who provided services on a capitated basis 
the motion also requests a subclass for a direct rico claim consisting of medical doctors who provided services on a fee for service basis to any person insured by humana pursuant to a contract without an arbitration clause or without a contract 
the motion  which has not been ruled on  also seeks two california subclasses  one involving physicians who provided services on a fee for service basis and the other for capitated physicians 
two of the defendants  aetna inc and cigna corporation  have entered into settlement agreements which have been approved by the court 
we intend to continue to defend this action vigorously 
government audits and other litigation and proceedings insurance industry brokerage practices matters we have responded to requests for information from the departments of insurance in the states of ohio and north carolina with respect to an industry wide investigation into certain insurance brokerage practices  including broker compensation arrangements  and bid quoting practices 
in connection with this industry wide review  we may receive requests for information or subpoenas from other regulators or attorneys general 
we intend to cooperate fully with any inquiries 
other in july  the office of the florida attorney general initiated an investigation  apparently relating to some of the same matters that are involved in the managed care industry purported class action litigation described above 
on september   the texas attorney general initiated a similar investigation 
no actions have been filed against us by either state 
these investigations are ongoing  and we have cooperated with the regulators in both states 
on may   we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement  or cia  with the office of inspector general  or oig  of the department of health and human services 
under the cia  we are obligated to  among other things  provide training  conduct periodic audits and make periodic reports to the oig 
in addition  our business practices are subject to review by various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities and federal regulatory authorities 
there has been increased scrutiny by these regulators of the managed health care companies business practices  including allegations of anticompetitive and unfair business activities  claims payment practices  commission payment practices  and utilization management practices 
we have been and continue to be subject to such reviews 
some of these have resulted in fines and could require changes in some of our practices and could also result in additional fines or other sanctions 
we also are involved in other lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of our business operations  including claims of medical malpractice  bad faith  nonacceptance or termination of providers  improper rate setting  failure to disclose network discounts and various other provider arrangements  as well as challenges to subrogation practices 
we also are subject to claims relating to performance of contractual obligations to providers  members  
table of contents and others  including failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the use of certain software products in processing claims 
pending state and federal legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 
in addition  some courts have issued rulings which make it easier to hold plans liable for medical negligence on the part of network providers on the theory that providers are agents of the plans and that the plans are therefore vicariously liable for the injuries to members by providers 
personal injury claims and claims for extracontractual damages arising from medical benefit denials are covered by insurance from our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and excess carriers  except to the extent that claimants seek punitive damages  which may not be covered by insurance in certain states in which insurance coverage for punitive damages is not permitted 
in addition  insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability has become increasingly costly and may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 
the likelihood or outcome of current or future suits  like the purported class action lawsuit described above  or governmental investigations  cannot be accurately predicted with certainty 
in addition  the potential for increased liability for medical negligence arising from claims adjudication  along with the increased litigation that has accompanied the negative publicity and public perception of our industry  adds to this uncertainty 
therefore  such legal actions and government audits and investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows

overview headquartered in louisville  kentucky  humana inc is one of the nation s largest publicly traded health benefits companies  based on our revenues of billion 
we offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and internet based plans for employer groups  government sponsored programs  and individuals 
as of december   we had approximately million members in our medical insurance programs  as well as approximately million members in our specialty products programs 
during  of our premiums and administrative services fees were derived from contracts with the federal government  including related to our tricare contracts and related to one contract in florida with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms 
additionally  of our premiums and administrative services fees in were earned from contracts with employer groups and individuals covering members located in texas  illinois  florida  kentucky and ohio 
we manage our business with two segments commercial and government 
the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals  and includes three lines of business fully insured medical  administrative services only  or aso  and specialty 
the government segment consists of members enrolled in government sponsored programs  and includes three lines of business medicare advantage  tricare  and medicaid 
we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business 
the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics 
these characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing  benefits and underwriting requirements 
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes 
we allocate all selling  general and administrative expenses  investment and other income  interest expense  and goodwill  but no other assets or liabilities  to our segments 
members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks  enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers 
our segments also share overhead costs and assets 
as a result  the profitability of each segment is interdependent 
we are somewhat unique in our industry by having revenues and enrollment approximately split between commercial and government segments  drawing revenues from group  individual  medicare  medicaid and military business lines 
we believe that it is difficult to time market cycles and external influences on various parts of our businesses 
by remaining committed to varied lines of business with a long term view  we may benefit through short term market cycles 
we believe our diversification across segments and products allows us to increase our chances of success 

table of contents our results are impacted by many factors  but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium  aso fee  and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our medical and administrative costs 
medical costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces  including new technologies and medical procedures  increasing capacity and supply of medical services  new prescription drugs and therapies  an aging population  the tort liability system  and government regulations 
our strategy to drive commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of a variety of innovative and consumer directed product designs 
these products are supported by electronic informational capabilities  including education  tools  and technologies provided primarily through the internet 
to that end  we have developed an innovative suite of products styled as smart products 
we believe that these smart products offer the best solution for many employers to the problem of quickly rising health care costs for their employees 
membership in our smart products and other consumer directed health plans exceeded  members at december   more than doubling from a year ago 
we believe that growth in these products  which are offered both on a fully insured and aso basis and may ultimately be competitively priced to produce higher margins  is a key component  among other items  for further improvement in the results of our commercial segment 
additionally  we have increased the diversification of our commercial membership base  not only through our consumer choice products  but also by expanding our aso membership to take advantage of our network discounts in the mid market group segment and launching our humanaone individual product to address an increasing migration of insureds from small group 
while we expect our smart products to become a driver of growth in the years ahead as health care inflation persists  we are enhancing the traditional products which comprise the bulk of our commercial portfolio today by applying our consumer choice innovation 
other important factors which impact our commercial segment profitability are both the competitive pricing environment and market conditions 
with respect to pricing  there is a tradeoff between sustaining or increasing underwriting margins versus increasing or decreasing enrollment 
we have experienced a decline in our membership in the to life group size as a result of pricing actions by some competitors who we perceive as desiring to gain market share in certain markets 
with respect to market conditions  we are impacted by economies of scale on administrative overhead 
as a result of a decline in preference for tightly managed hmo products  medical costs have become increasingly comparable among the larger competitors 
product design and consumer involvement have become more important drivers of medical services consumption  and administrative expense efficiency is becoming a more significant driver of commercial margin sustainability 
consequently  we continually evaluate our administrative expense structure and realize administrative expense savings through productivity gains 
additionally  because our commercial segment shares overhead costs with our government segment  an increase or decrease in the size of our government operations impacts our commercial segment profitability 
in our government segment  after being awarded the south region contract in  we transitioned our tricare business to one of three newly created regions under the government s revised tricare program 
on july   our regions and contract servicing approximately million tricare members became part of a new north region  which was awarded to another contractor 
on august   our regions and contract became part of our new south region contract 
on november   the region contract  previously administered by the same contractor  with approximately million members  became part of the south region contract 
the members added with the region contract essentially offset the members lost four months earlier with the regions and contract 
with the transition complete  we look forward to a more stable level of tricare membership in and the start of the second option year under the south contract on april  as more fully discussed on page  tricare revenues consist of an underwriting fee  healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which  in turn  are reimbursed  and administrative services fees primarily related to claim processing and customer service 
in our medicare business  the passage of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act  or mma  in december demonstrated the federal government s commitment to providing health 
table of contents benefits and options to seniors and has started the resurgence of medicare as a business line that should bring us accelerating growth in and we already have established medicare private fee for service plans in eleven new states  and recently have received approvals from cms establishing local medicare ppo plans in many of our existing markets where we have established competitive networks 
medicare private fee for service plans generally offer additional benefits compared to traditional medicare in exchange for a monthly premium paid by the member 
these plans typically include a prescription drug benefit with no provider network restrictions 
local medicare ppo plans typically will offer an even higher level of benefits to members  including a prescription drug benefit and a lower level of member cost sharing on many benefits while seeking medical services from in network providers 
these products are more fully described beginning on page we continue to evaluate additional states and local markets where we believe we can be competitive with these products and anticipate further expansion during accordingly  we anticipate an organic increase in our medicare advantage enrollment of to during including the february acquisition of careplus health plans of florida  as more fully described below  we anticipate having approximately  to  medicare advantage members at december  although still under evaluation  we believe we are well positioned to participate in medicare regional ppo plans and the medicare prescription drug plan  as established by the mma  beginning in in connection herewith  we have notified cms of our intent to bid on these programs 
as a long time successful participant in the medicare program  we believe that we possess the business competencies and management experience with senior product design  a robust and scalable multi channel distribution system  an established and competitive network including a national retail pharmacy network  and an established brand awareness with seniors  all of which will enable us to compete for market share in this expanding business line over the next several years 
other highlights include the following on april   we acquired ochsner health plan for million in cash  establishing a new market in new orleans  louisiana for our commercial and medicare lines of business and on february   we acquired careplus health plans of florida  increasing our medicare presence in south florida 
these transactions are more fully described below and in note to the consolidated financial statements

the consolidated medical expense ratio in of increased from in while the consolidated sg a expense ratio of in declined from in cash flows from operations of million in decreased from million in the prior year primarily due to the timing of medicare advantage premium remittances more fully discussed in the liquidity section on page during  we repurchased million common shares for million at an average price of per share 
we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain critical accounting principles and estimates impact our financial statements 
recent acquisitions on february   we acquired careplus health plans of florida  or careplus  as well as its affiliated medical centers and pharmacy company for approximately million in cash including the acquisition of 
table of contents approximately million of statutory capital and surplus in excess of the minimum statutory requirements 
careplus provides medicare advantage hmo plans and benefits to approximately  medicare eligible beneficiaries in miami dade  broward and palm beach counties 
this acquisition enhances our medicare market position in south florida 
we financed the transaction with million of cash on hand and million of borrowings under our credit agreement 
the purchase price is subject to a balance sheet settlement process with a nine month claims run out period 
on april   we acquired ochsner health plan  or ochsner  from the ochsner clinic foundation for million in cash 
ochsner  a louisiana health plan  added approximately  commercial medical members  primarily in fully insured large group accounts  and approximately  members in the medicare advantage program 
this acquisition enabled us to enter a new market with significant market share which should facilitate new sales opportunities in this and surrounding markets  including houston  texas

fully insured commercial medical cost trends are expected to rise in the range of to for  including the lowering effect of approximately basis points due to a growing mix of individual membership

this increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt  due to the issuance of million senior notes in august income taxes our effective tax rate in of decreased compared to the effective tax rate in our effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate due primarily to tax exempt investment income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate 
we expect an effective tax rate in of approximately 
this is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of a contingent gain during the first quarter of in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitation on a tax position related to the tax year and tax exempt investment income

table of contents summary net income was million  or per diluted share  in compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the increase in earnings resulted primarily from significant improvement in operating earnings for the commercial segment and a decrease in expenses for asset impairments and other unusual items 
premium revenues and medical membership premium revenues increased  to billion  for compared to billion for higher premium revenues resulted primarily from increases in fully insured commercial premium rates and an increase in tricare premiums 
items impacting premium rates include changes in premium and government reimbursement rates  as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership  the mix of product offerings  and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 
commercial segment premium revenues increased  to billion  for compared to billion for this improvement resulted primarily from increases in per member premiums in the to range for on our fully insured commercial business 
additionally  our fully insured commercial medical membership increased or  members  to  at december  compared to  at december  government segment premium revenues increased  to billion  for compared to billion for this increase primarily was attributable to our tricare business  partially offset by a reduction in our medicare advantage membership 
rates were increased upon annual renewal of our base tricare contract and led to an increase in tricare premium revenues of million  or  compared to medicare advantage membership was  at december  compared to  at december   a decline of  members  or 
this decline resulted as we exited several counties in some of our markets effective january  and general attrition in certain markets as a result of annual changes to benefit designs 
per member medicare premiums increased in the to range for administrative services fees administrative services fees for were million  an increase of million from million for for the commercial segment  administrative services fees increased million  or  to million 
this increase corresponds to the higher level of aso membership at december   which was  members  compared to  members at december  and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member 
administrative services fees for the government segment increased million when comparing to this increase resulted from contractual adjustments related to tricare for life  a program for seniors in which we provided medical benefit administrative services 
investment and other income investment and other income totaled million in  an increase of million from million in this increase resulted primarily from an increase in net realized capital gains due to a million gain from the sale of privately held venture capital investments and lower investment impairment losses  a result of an improving market 
we recorded investment impairment losses of million in compared to million in higher average invested balances offset lower interest rates 
the average yield on investment securities was in  declining from in medical expense the consolidated mer for was  decreasing basis points from for the commercial segment mer for was  decreasing basis points from for the improvement in the mer primarily resulted from per member premium rate increases in excess of medical cost trends for our large group customers and the attrition of groups with higher medical expense ratios 
the government segment medical expense ratio for was  increasing basis points from for this increase primarily was attributable to tricare as a result of having a higher level of revenues from bid price adjustment activity in 
table of contents sg a expense the consolidated sg a expense ratio decreased basis points in primarily because of a decrease in severance and related employee benefit costs of million  the absence of expenses of million associated with a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items  offset by an increase in building impairments of million 
increased operating efficiency led to the consolidation of seven service centers into four and an enterprise wide workforce reduction affecting administrative expenses in both and by recording expenses for severance and related employee benefit costs and building impairments 
severance and related employee benefit costs  more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  amounted to million in and million in the severance amount primarily related to the service center consolidation 
building impairments  more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  amounted to million in and million in during  we recorded million of administrative expenses for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our acquisition of physician corporation of america  or pca 
the million of expenses in resulted from three issues 
first  on january   we settled a dispute with a provider for million primarily regarding old claims of pca subsidiaries dating prior to humana s acquisition 
second  during the fourth quarter of  as a december  trial date approached  efforts intensified to reach settlement of an old pca shareholder dispute for periods prior to humana s acquisition of pca 
as a result  we accrued million because the loss was probable and the amount could be reasonably estimated 
we reversed million of this reserve when the final settlement was paid during the third quarter of third  in connection with an agreement reached in november  we partially wrote off a note receivable of million from the purchaser of our workers compensation business which was sold in the agreement with the purchaser resulted when a significant customer contract was terminated in the fourth quarter of we acquired the workers compensation business in connection with the pca acquisition 
the commercial and government segments sg a expense ratios likewise were impacted by the same items described previously 
depreciation and amortization was million in  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase results from accelerated depreciation of software in of million  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  partially offset by lower amortization related to other intangible assets as costs associated with the government contract acquired with the tricare and transaction became fully amortized in the second quarter of interest expense interest expense was million in  an increase of million from million in this increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt due to the issuance of million senior notes in august offset by lower interest rates 
income taxes our effective tax rate in of increased compared to the effective tax rate in the increase in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from a lower proportion of tax exempt investment income to pretax income 
during  the internal revenue service completed their audit of all open years prior to which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately million 
this was offset by an increase of approximately million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies

table of contents liquidity our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums  administrative services fees  investment income  and proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings 
our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments  administrative expenses  interest expense  and taxes  purchases of investment securities and capital expenditures and payments on borrowings 
cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  from million at december  the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december   and is summarized as follows in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operating activities our operating cash flows in were significantly impacted by the timing of the medicare advantage premium remittance which is payable to us on the first day of each month 
when the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday  we have historically received this payment at the end of the previous month 
as such  the medicare advantage receipts for january of million and january of million were received in december and december  respectively  because january is a holiday 
this timing accounts for a significant portion of the unearned revenues balance on our consolidated balance sheet at december  beginning in  the monthly premium payment schedule includes a change in timing from previous practice 
as a result of this change  the january payment of million originally scheduled to be received on friday  december   was changed to monday  january   or one business day later 
therefore  we received only monthly medicare advantage premium remittances during versus monthly premium remittances during other than the impact from the timing of the medicare advantage premium receipts  the increase in net income and cash generated from changes in working capital increased our operating cash flow in compared to the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and administrative services fees and payments of medical expenses 
we illustrate these changes with the following summary of receivables and medical and other expenses payable 
the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december   and change in thousands tricare base receivable bid price adjustments bpas change orders less long term portion of bpas tricare subtotal commercial and other allowance for doubtful accounts total net receivables reconciliation to cash flow statement change in long term receivables provision for doubtful accounts receivables from acquisition change in receivables in cash flow statement 
table of contents tricare base receivables increased in due to the transition to the reimbursement model under the south region contract beginning on august  under our former tricare contracts with a fixed price  we bore the cost of changes in the underlying pattern of health care for which the government was at risk until subsequently reimbursed in a later period through a bid price adjustment  or bpa process 
the fixed price and bpa process added variability to our revenues  related receivables and operating cash flows because the timing of the settlement was uncertain 
under the new tricare south region contract  the fixed price and bpa process was eliminated and replaced with a new reimbursement model 
under the new reimbursement model  claims paid are reimbursed by the federal government generally within business days 
the delivery of health care services results in a lag between the time the service is provided and ultimately reimbursed by the federal government  typically three months 
thus  tricare receivables are generally collected over a three to four month period 
likewise  tricare medical claims payable are generally paid over the same three to four month period 
tricare base receivables increased in as rates under our base tricare contract increased upon the annual renewal of the contracts for regions and and regions and the detail of medical and other expenses payable was as follows at december   and change in thousands ibnr reported claims in process other medical expenses payable total medical and other expenses payable reconciliation to cash flow statement medical and other expenses payable from acquisition change in medical and other expenses payable in cash flow statement ibnr represents an estimate of medical expenses payable for claims incurred but not reported ibnr at the balance sheet date 
the level of ibnr is primarily impacted by membership levels  medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time  which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received ie a shorter time span results in a lower ibnr 
reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process  which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling 
other medical expenses payable includes capitation and pharmacy payables 
the balance due to our pharmacy benefit administrator fluctuates due to bi weekly payments and the month end cutoff 
medical and other expenses payable increased during and due primarily to medical claims inflation 
changes in other liabilities primarily resulted from the timing of payments for taxes  payments related to our tricare contract including subcontractors and general vendor payables 
cash flow from investing activities during  we paid million to acquire ochsner  net of million of cash acquired 
we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows at an increasing rate over the last several years in investment securities  primarily short duration fixed income securities  totaling million in  million in and million in our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing  billing and collections  
table of contents medical utilization review  and customer service 
total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million in  million in  and million in excluding acquisitions  we expect our total capital expenditures in to be approximately million  most of which will be used for our technology initiatives and improvement of administrative facilities 
proceeds from the sale of property and equipment relate primarily to consolidating our service centers in jacksonville and san antonio including the sale of the jacksonville office tower in for million and a san antonio office building for million in cash flow from financing activities we repurchased million common shares for million at an average price of per share in  million common shares for million at an average price of per share in and million common shares for million at an average price of per share in authorization for additional common share repurchases expired in january during  we issued million senior notes due august  in order to term out our short term debt and take advantage of historically low interest rates 
in addition  during we received proceeds of million in exchange for new swap agreements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our borrowings and swap agreements 
credit agreement on september   we replaced our existing credit agreements with a new year million unsecured revolving credit agreement which will expire in september we previously maintained two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a million  year revolving credit agreement and a million  day revolving credit agreement 
under the agreement  at our option  we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis 
the revolving credit portion of the agreement bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on libor plus a spread 
the spread  which varies depending on our credit ratings  ranges from to basis points 
we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization 
this facility fee  currently basis points  may fluctuate between and basis points  depending upon our credit ratings 
in addition  a utilization fee of basis points is payable for any day in which borrowings under the facility exceeds of the total million commitment 
the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis  at our option 
the year million credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default  including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth  minimum interest coverage  and maximum leverage ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenant requirements 
the terms of this credit agreement also includes standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing  including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow 
we have not experienced a material adverse effect  and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect 
we do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to humana in the future 
we have other relationships  including financial advisory and banking  with some of the parties to the new agreement 
the maximum amount available for borrowing under the credit agreement was million at december   reduced from the million due to securing letters of credit of million under the credit agreement 
no amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit 
on february   we paid approximately million in cash for careplus including approximately million of statutory capital and surplus in excess of the minimum statutory requirement as well as estimated transaction costs 
we financed the transaction with million of cash on hand and million of borrowings under our credit agreement 
after the careplus transaction  we have million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement 

table of contents commercial paper program we maintain and may issue short term debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow 
the program is backed by our credit agreement described above 
aggregate borrowings under both the credit agreement and commercial paper program generally will not exceed million 
in connection with the credit arrangement  the conduit commercial paper program allowing indirect access to the commercial paper market through a third party was cancelled 
at december   we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
shelf registration our universal shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission allows us to register debt or equity securities  from time to time  with the amount  price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale 
after the issuance of our million  senior notes in august  we have up to million remaining from a total of million under the universal shelf registration 
the universal shelf registration allows us to use the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities for our operations and for other general corporate purposes  including repayment or refinancing of borrowings  working capital  capital expenditures  investments  acquisitions  or the repurchase of our outstanding securities 
we believe our financial condition is strong and that our cash balances  investment securities  operating cash flows  access to debt and equity markets and borrowing capacity  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and fund future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures 
however  adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future 
our investment grade credit rating at december  was baa according to moody s investors services  inc  or moody s  and bbb  according to standard poor s corporation  or s p 
a downgrade to ba or lower by moody s and bb or lower by s p would give the counterparties of three of our interest rate swap agreements with a million notional amount  the right  but not the obligation  to cancel the interest rate swap agreement 
if cancelled  we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap agreement 
assuming these swap agreements had been cancelled on december   we would have received million  net 
other than the swap agreements  adverse changes in our credit ratings may not create  increase  or accelerate any liabilities 
in addition  we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry 
our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries  most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions 
our parent company liquidity improved during with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increasing million to million at december  compared to million at december  see schedule to this form k beginning on page for our parent company financial information 
regulatory requirements certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends  loans  or other cash transfers to humana inc  our parent company  require minimum levels of equity  as well as limit investments to approved securities 
the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus 
in most states  prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 
as of december   we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of  million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries 
each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated million 
although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume  product mix  and the quality of assets held  minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level 
certain states rely on risk based capital requirements  or rbc  to define the required levels of equity 
rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to 
table of contents monitor an entity s solvency 
this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels 
if rbc were adopted by all states at december   each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance and we would have million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc 
contractual obligations we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december  as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands debt interest operating leases purchase and other obligations total debt includes million of borrowings under the credit agreement which matures on september  related to the february  careplus acquisition 
debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants 
we believe the likelihood of debt covenant violation is remote 
interest includes the estimated contractual interest payments under our debt agreements net of the effect of the associated swapagreements assuming no change in the variable libor rate as of december  we lease facilities  computer hardware  and other equipment under long term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through we sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments 
an operating lease  accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  is a type of off balance sheet arrangement 
assuming we acquired the asset  rather than leased  we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase and other obligations include agreements to purchase services  primarily information technology related services  or to make improvements to real estate that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the appropriate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
indemnifications and guarantees our operating lease of an airplane  which expires january   provides for a residual value payment of no more than million at the end of the lease term 
at the end of the term we have the right to exercise a purchase option or the airplane can be sold to a third party 
if we decide not to exercise our purchase option  we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of million 
this amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds in excess of million from the sale of the airplane to a third party 
through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities  certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc  our parent company  in the event of insolvency for  member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency   benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged  and  payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency 
our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our tricare subsidiaries 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us  or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract  which may 
table of contents include  for example  litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 
related parties no related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
certain immaterial related party transactions are discussed in our proxy statement for the meeting to be held april  see certain transactions with management and others 
market risk sensitive financial instruments and positions the level of our pretax earnings is subject to risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the short term duration of the fixed income investment portfolio 
we evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of  and basis points over the next twelve month period  as reflected in the following table 
the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt  which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelve month period 
this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income  including  among others  unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio  shifts in the asset mix between taxable and tax exempt securities  and spread changes specific to various investment categories 
in the past ten years  changes in month libor rates during the year have exceeded basis points twice  have not changed between and basis points  have changed between and basis points once and have changed by less than basis points seven times 
libor was at december  our model assumed the maximum possible reduction in libor could not exceed basis points

no termination notices were received in connection with our currently existing contracts 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act  or mma  was signed into law 
we believe mma offers new opportunities in our medicare programs  including our hmo  ppo  and private fee for service products 
we have made additional investments in the medicare advantage program to enhance our ability to participate in these expanded programs 

table of contents our tricare south region contract  which we were awarded in  covers approximately million beneficiaries 
the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense 
the contract is for a five year period subject to annual renewals at the federal government s option with the second option period scheduled to begin april  we currently have medicaid contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration through june  our other medicaid contracts are in florida and illinois  and are annual contracts 
as of december   puerto rico accounted for approximately of our total medicaid membership 
the loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action  including reductions in premium payments to us  or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us  may have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
legal proceedings we are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business  including employment matters  breach of contract actions  tort claims  and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud 
a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under legal proceedings of item in part we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty  and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters 
in addition  recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 
therefore  these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities  goodwill  and long lived assets 
these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events  and accordingly  actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
medical expense recognition medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
ibnr represents a substantial portion of our medical and other expenses payable as follows december  percentage of total december  percentage of total dollars in thousands ibnr reported claims in process other medical expenses payable total medical and other expenses payable estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment 
accordingly  it represents a critical accounting estimate 
changes in this estimate can materially affect  either favorably or unfavorably  our results from operations and overall financial position 
for example  a basis point  or percent  change in the 
table of contents estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at december   which represents approximately of total liabilities  would require an adjustment of approximately million in a future period in which a revision in the estimate became known 
we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions  primarily based upon historical claim payment and claim receipt patterns  as well as historical medical cost trends 
depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated  we apply a different method in determining our estimate 
for periods prior to the most recent three months  the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes 
completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period 
for the most recent three months  the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months  adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data  provider contracting changes  changes in benefit levels  product mix  and weekday seasonality 
the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result 
conversely  for the most recent three months of incurred claims  the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result  which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation 
medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities  physician services  prescription drugs  and new medical technologies  as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  increases in medical services capacity  direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services  an aging population  catastrophes  and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends 
internal factors such as system conversions  claims processing cycle times  changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends 
all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months 
additionally  we continually prepare and review follow up studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time 
the results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months 
each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 
the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december  data completion factor a claims trend factor b decrease increase in factor increase decrease in medical and other expenses payable decrease increase in factor decrease increase in medical and other expenses payable dollars in thousands a reflects estimated potential changes in medical and other expenses payable caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent three months 

table of contents b reflects estimated potential changes in medical and other expenses payable caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent three months 
most medical claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider 
as a result  these liabilities generally are described as having a short tail  which causes less than of our medical and other expenses payable as of the end of any given period to be outstanding for more than months 
as such  we expect that substantially all of the estimate of medical and other expenses payable will be known and paid during our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards 
actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient  or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate 
therefore  in many situations  the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
ibnr established in connection with our tricare contracts is typically more difficult to estimate than for our other operations  because there are more variables that impact the estimate 
these variables include continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries  changes in the utilization of military treatment facilities and changes in levels of benefits versus the original contract provisions 
many of these variables are impacted significantly by an increase or decrease in military activity involving the united states armed forces 
additionally  we transitioned to the new tricare south region contract during the latter half of accordingly  our historical claims experience and familiarity with claim payment patterns for this block of business is not as mature as our other lines of business 
we have considered all of these factors in establishing our ibnr estimate 
each of these factors required significant judgment by management 
as more fully described on page  our tricare contract contains risk sharing provisions with the department of defense and with subcontractors  which effectively limit profits and losses when actual claim experience varies from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our annual bid 
as a result of these contract provisions  the impact of changes in estimates for prior year tricare medical claims payable on our results of operations is reduced substantially  whether positive or negative 
as more fully described on pages and  we have a substantial percentage of our medicare and medicaid membership under risk sharing arrangements with providers 
accordingly  the impact of changes in estimates for prior year medical claims payable on our results from operations that are attributable to our medicare and medicaid lines of business may also be significantly reduced  whether positive or negative 

table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of changes in medical and other expenses payable for the years ended december   and in thousands balances at january acquisitions incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid balances at december amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled 
negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated favorable development 
positive amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims ultimately being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated unfavorable development 
as summarized in the previous table  claim reserve balances at december  ultimately settled during for million less than the amounts originally estimated  representing of medical claim expenses incurred in during  claim reserve balances at december  ultimately settled for million less than the amounts originally estimated  representing of medical claim expenses recorded in this million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years resulted primarily from favorable development in our medicare line of business as a result of better than expected utilization in the latter half of the substantial majority of this favorable development in the medicare business occurred under risk sharing arrangements with providers  which resulted in minimizing the impact on our reported results from operations 
during  claim reserve balances at december  ultimately settled for million more than the amounts originally recorded  representing of medical claim expenses recorded in the million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years during consists of million attributable to our tricare operations with the remaining million primarily resulting from fourth quarter utilization in our commercial medical products ultimately being lower than originally estimated 
the million change in tricare incurred related to prior years resulted from establishing medical expense reserves resulting from enhanced benefits enacted for tricare beneficiaries as a result of congressional legislation  as well as lower than originally estimated utilization of medical services by tricare beneficiaries in the second half of revenue recognition we generally establish one year contracts with commercial employer groups  subject to cancellation by the employer group s day written notice 
our contracts with federal or state governments are generally multi year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions with the exception of our medicare advantage contracts with the federal government which renew annually 
our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage 
except for tricare contracts discussed in the following section  our government contracts also establish monthly rates per member but may have additional amounts due to us based on items 
table of contents such as age  working status  or specific health issues of the member 
changes in revenues from cms for our medicare advantage products resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
premium revenues and aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates 
in addition  we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer s enrollment and customers that ultimately may fail to pay 
enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group  an individual  or the government  also known as retroactive membership adjustments  are estimated based on historical trends 
we monitor the collectibility of specific accounts  the aging of receivables  as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions  and reflect any required adjustments in the current period s revenue 
we bill and collect premium and aso fee remittances from employer groups  the federal and state governments  and individual medicare advantage members monthly 
premium and aso fee receivables are presented net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments 
premiums and aso fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues 
tricare contract in  tricare revenues represented of total premiums and administrative services fees 
the single tricare contract for the south region includes multiple revenue generating activities and as such was evaluated under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we allocate the consideration to the various components based on the relative fair values of the components 
tricare revenues consist generally of an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian healthcare services delivered to eligible beneficiaries  healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government  and  administrative service fees related to claim processing  customer service  enrollment  disease management and other services 
we recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided 
health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health care services are provided 
administrative service fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed 
the tricare contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits 
annually  we negotiate a target healthcare cost amount  or target cost  with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee 
any variance from the target cost is shared 
we earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance in actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost 
we receive for any cost underrun  subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to of the target cost 
we pay for any cost overrun  subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative of the target cost 
a final settlement occurs to months after the end of each contract year to which it applies 
we defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
we estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in medical expenses 
the tricare contract contains provisions to negotiate change orders 
change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract 
under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations 
change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year 
we record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our former tricare contracts for regions and and regions and  which expired during  contained provisions for not only change orders but for bid price adjustments  or bpas as well 
there are no provisions for bpas in our current tricare contract 
bpas were utilized to retroactively adjust revenues for 
table of contents the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk  including the risks associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities  or mtfs  change in the number of persons eligible for tricare benefits  and medical unit cost inflation 
we work closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and mtf workload data  and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual bpa requirements 
final settlement of bpas occurs only at specified intervals  typically in excess of months after the end of a contract year 
we record revenues applicable to bpas when these amounts are determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
investment securities investment securities totaled  million  or of total assets at december  debt securities totaled  million  or of our total investment portfolio 
more than of our debt securities were of investment grade quality  with an average credit rating of aa by standard poor s at december  most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end bb or better of the non investment grade spectrum 
our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 
duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates  providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates 
however  actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration 
the average duration of our debt securities was approximately years at december  based on this duration  a increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our debt securities by approximately million 
our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and  as a result  are stated at fair value 
fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices 
non traded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor 
fair value of venture capital debt securities that are privately held  or where an observable quoted market price does not exist  are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies 
such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing  comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business  and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are included as a component of stockholders equity until realized from a sale or impairment 
gross unrealized losses and fair value  aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at december   included the following less than months months or more total fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses in thousands us government obligations tax exempt municipal securities corporate and other securities mortgage backed securities redeemable preferred stocks debt securities non redeemable preferred stocks total investment securities we regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment 
we consider factors affecting the investee  factors affecting the industry the investee operates within  and general debt and equity market trends 
we consider the length of time an investment s fair value has been below carrying value  the near term prospects for 
table of contents recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized 
if and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary  the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through earnings 
the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations  facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time  or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment 
the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment 
the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments 
the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment 
unrealized losses at december  resulted from positions from a total of positions held 
less than of the carrying value of our consolidated investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position greater than one year 
the unrealized losses at december  generally can be attributed to changes in interest rates 
all issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities 
after taking into account these and other factors  including our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity  we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary 
there were no impairment losses recorded in we recorded impairment losses of million in and million in after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary 
goodwill and long lived assets at december   goodwill and other long lived assets represented of total assets and of total stockholders equity 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that we not amortize goodwill to earnings  but instead that we test goodwill at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
a reporting unit is one level below our commercial and government segments 
the commercial segment s two reporting units consist of fully and self insured medical and specialty 
the government segment s three reporting units consist of medicare advantage  tricare and medicaid 
goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 
our strategy  long range business plan  and annual planning process supports our goodwill impairment tests 
these tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios 
we used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weighted average cost of capital 
key assumptions including changes in membership  premium yields  medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our long range business plan and annual planning process 
if these assumptions differ from actual  the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected 
goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss 
long lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite lived intangible assets 
these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life  and are subject to impairment reviews 
we periodically review long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist  and  if so  estimate fair value 
we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long lived assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life  including accelerating depreciation for these assets 
we recognized losses due to 
table of contents impairment and accelerated depreciation from changes in estimated useful life of million in  million in and million in see note to the consolidated financial statements

in september  the fasb delayed the previously scheduled third quarter effective date until the issuance of additional implementation guidance  expected in upon issuance of a final standard  we will evaluate the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
cautionary statements this document includes both historical and forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are made within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of we intend such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events  trends and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including  among other things  the information discussed below 
in making these 
table of contents statements  we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results 
our business is highly complicated  regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results 
if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members  or if our estimates of medical claim reserves based upon our estimates of future medical claims are inadequate  our profitability could decline 
we use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members 
these costs include claims payments  capitation payments  allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members 
these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members 
generally  premiums in the health care business are fixed for one year periods 
accordingly  costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums 
we estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns  medical inflation  historical developments  including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns  and other relevant factors 
we also record medical claims reserves for future payments 
we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 
however  increases in the use or cost of services by our members  competition  government regulations and many other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include increased use of medical facilities and services  including prescription drugs  increased cost of such services  the company s membership mix  variances in actual versus estimated levels of cost associated with new products  benefits or lines of business  product changes or benefit level changes  membership in markets lacking adequate provider networks  changes in the demographic characteristics of an account or market  termination of capitation arrangements resulting in the transfer of membership to fee for service arrangements  changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services  concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals  possible changes in our pharmacy rebate program with drug manufacturers  catastrophes  including acts of terrorism  epidemics  or severe weather  the introduction of new or costly treatments  including new technologies  medical cost inflation  and new government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes 
failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
we are in a highly competitive industry 
many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry and have a larger market share and greater financial resources than we do in some markets 
in addition  
table of contents other companies may enter our markets in the future  including emerging competitors in the medicare advantage program and in consumer directed health plans  such as health savings accounts hsa 
we believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial  so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily  and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually 
while health plans compete on the basis of many factors  including service and the quality and depth of provider networks  we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition 
in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs  we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
factors such as business consolidations  strategic alliances  legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases  despite being faced with increasing medical costs 
the commercial pricing environment  particularly in the to member groups  is extremely competitive  and several of our competitors  including public and not for profit companies  are pricing aggressively to gain market share 
premium increases  introduction of new product designs  and our relationship with our providers in various markets  among other issues  could also affect our membership levels 
other actions that could affect membership levels include the possible exit of or entrance to medicare advantage or commercial markets 
to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to managed care plans  cms has implemented a risk adjustment model that uses diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits 
cms has also redesigned its data collection and processing system to reduce administrative data burden on medicare health plans 
in  the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to percent  from percent in the phase in of risk adjusted payment will be completed in  the portion of risk adjusted payment will increase to percent in and percent in under the new risk adjustment methodology  humana and all managed care organizations must collect  capture and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms twice a year 
as a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment methodology described above  our cms monthly payments per member may change materially  either favorably or unfavorably 
if we do not compete effectively in our markets  if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share  if membership does not increase as we expect  or if it declines  or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our future performance depends in large part upon our management team s ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future 
this strategy includes the growth of our commercial segment business  with emphasis on our aso and individual products  introduction of new products and benefit designs  including our smart  consumer choice products  opportunities created with the new medicare advantage products  the adoption of new technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts 
we believe that by combining our abilities in product design  clinical programs and consumer engagement  we can achieve cost savings for our customers and our company 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position the company for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted 
failure to implement this strategy or to contain our administrative expenses in line with our membership may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data  or to strategically implement new information systems  or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business 
our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  provide effective and efficient service to our customers  and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems 
as a result of our past and on going acquisition activities  we have acquired additional systems 
we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate  have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities  and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity  we could have operational disruptions  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing  have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes  have regulatory problems  have increases in operating expenses  lose existing customers  have difficulty in attracting new customers  or suffer other adverse consequences 
our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain  protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards  and changing customer preferences 
we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systems related support  equipment  facilities  and certain data  including data center operations  data network  voice communication services and pharmacy data processing 
this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract  due to internal or external factors 
a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry 
we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 
there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems  developing new systems to support our operations  integrating new systems  protecting our proprietary information  and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future 
failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to manage prescription drug costs successfully  our financial results could suffer 
in general  prescription drug costs have been rapidly rising over the past few years 
these increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs  direct to consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brand name drugs  and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes 
in order to control prescription drug costs  we have implemented multi tiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs  including our four tiered copayment benefit design  rx and an rx allowance program organized by evidence based impact 
we cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs 
failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we are involved in various legal actions  which  if resolved unfavorably to us  could result in substantial monetary damages 
we are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business  including employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  and tort claims 
we  together with some of our competitors in the health benefits business are defendants in a number of purported class action lawsuits 
these include an action originally filed against us and nine of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of health care providers 
two companies have now settled this action 
this suit alleges breaches of federal statutes  including erisa and rico 
depending upon the outcome of these cases  these lawsuits may cause or force changes in the practices of the managed care industry 
in addition  because of the nature of the health care business  we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations  including the design  management and offering of products and services 
these include and could include in the future claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums  claims relating to the denial of health care benefits  challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims  medical malpractice actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for our providers alleged malpractice  allegations of anti competitive and unfair business activities  provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts  disputes related to self funded business  including actions alleging claim administration errors  claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices  and claims relating to customer audits and contract performance 
in some cases  substantial non economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act  rico and other statutes may be sought 
while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities  other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance  insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded 
additionally  the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly 
as a result  we have increased the amount of risk that we self insure  particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business 
we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self insurance 
however  some types of damages  like punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance  particularly in those jurisdictions in which coverage of punitive damages is prohibited 
insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 
a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under legal proceedings in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty  and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters 
therefore  these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as a government contractor  we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs 
a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs  including the tricare  medicare advantage  and medicaid programs 
these programs involve various risks  including at december   under one of our contracts with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  we provided health insurance coverage to approximately  members in florida 
this contract accounted for approximately of our total premiums and aso fees for the 
table of contents year ended december  the loss of this and other cms contracts or significant changes in the medicare advantage program as a result of legislative or administrative action  including reductions in payments to us or increases in benefits to members without corresponding increases in payments  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  at december   our tricare business  which accounted for approximately of our total premiums and aso fees during  consisted of the south region contract 
the south region contract is a five year contract  subject to annual renewals at the government s option that covers approximately million beneficiaries 
this contract also is generally subject to frequent change from events and circumstances such as the escalated conflict in the middle east 
these changes may include a reduction or increase in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll  in the revenue we receive or in our administrative or health care costs 
in the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts  our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the loss of our current tricare contract would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows  at december   under our contract with the puerto rico health insurance administration  we provided health insurance coverage to approximately  medicaid members in puerto rico 
this contract  which expires june  accounted for approximately of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december  due to the election of a new governor and a new commissioner of insurance in puerto rico  the renewal of the medicaid contract is uncertain 
at this time we are unable to predict the outcome 
the loss of this contract or significant changes in the puerto rico medicaid program as a result of legislative or administrative action  including reductions in payments to us or increases in benefits to members without corresponding increases in payments  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  changes to these government programs in the future may also affect our ability or willingness to participate in these programs  higher comparative medical costs  government regulatory and reporting requirements  higher marketing and advertising costs per member as a result of marketing to individuals as opposed to groups  and the possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs  including medicare and medicaid  if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal false claims act 
our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation  which  along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform  increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability 
the health care industry in general  and health insurance  particularly health maintenance organizations  or hmos  and preferred provider organizations  or ppos  are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation  including regulation relating to minimum net worth  licensing requirements  approval of policy language and benefits  mandated benefits and processes  provider compensation arrangements  
table of contents member disclosure  approval of entry  withdrawal or re entry into a state or market  premium rates  and periodic examinations by state and federal agencies 
state regulations require our licensed  operating subsidiaries to maintain minimum net worth requirements and restrict some investment activities 
additionally  those regulations restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments  loans  loan repayments or other payments to us 
in recent years  significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted 
state and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to mandatory benefits and products  rules tightening time periods in which claims must be paid  medical malpractice reform  defining medical necessity  health insurance access  provider compensation and contract language  disclosure of provider fee schedules and other data about payments to providers  sometimes called transparency  product flexibility and use of innovative technology  disclosure of provider quality information  health plan liability to members who fail to receive appropriate care  disclosure and composition of physician networks  formation of regional national association health plans for small employers  adding further restrictions and administrative requirements on the use  retention  transmission  processing  production and disclosure of personally identifiable health information  physicians ability to collectively negotiate contract terms with carriers  including fees  and mental health parity 
all of these proposals could apply to us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory change will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members  increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 
the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  has adopted risk based capital requirements  also known as rbc  which is subject to state by state adoption and to the extent implemented  sets minimum capitalization requirements for insurance and hmo companies 
the naic recommendations for life insurance companies were adopted in all states and the prescribed calculation for hmos has been adopted in most states in which we operate 
the hmo rules may increase the minimum capital required for some of our subsidiaries 
the use of individually identifiable data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels 
these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data 
most are derived from the privacy provisions in the 
table of contents federal gramm leach bliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa 
hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions  establishing uniform health care provider  payer  and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data 
regulations issued in february set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by april  violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties 
compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements  training and administrative effort 
the final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws  but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 
hipaa could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates 
another area receiving increased focus is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims 
many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days 
however  due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards  procedures and penalties  we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices 
the provider sponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment  including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general 
this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose our company to additional liability and penalties 
we are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations 
these can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general  cms  the office of the inspector general of health and human services  the office of personnel management  the department of justice  the department of labor  the defense contract audit agency  and state departments of insurance and departments of health 
several attorneys general are currently investigating the practices of insurance brokers  including those of certain of the companies in the health care industry 
all of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs  or the imposition of fines  penalties and other sanctions 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members  our business could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members 
our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers 
these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost effective manner 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand to contract with us  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us  less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  some providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions and negotiating power 
in addition  physician or practice management companies  which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage  may  in some cases  compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
in some situations  we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined  fixed  per member per month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members ie capitation 
the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us 
in addition  payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with 
table of contents whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members 
the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider 
there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 
our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 
because we operate as a holding company  we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc  the parent company 
these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states departments of insurance 
in most states  we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts  or  in some states  any amount 
in addition  we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval
