the valuation allowance was reduced because the company believes that the deferred tax assets will be realized  resulting from its current operating success  coupled with our future positive outlook 
the company s income tax expense represented current state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the restaurant industry  in general  operates with a working capital deficit because most of our investments are in long term restaurant operating assets 
we do not normally require large amounts of working capital to maintain operations since sales are for cash  purchases are on open accounts and meat and produce inventories are limited to a three to five day supply to assure freshness 
we do not have significant levels of accounts receivable or inventory  and receive credit from our trade suppliers 
funds available from cash sales not needed immediately to pay our trade suppliers are generally used for non current capital expenditures or invested in high quality short term investments 
we have working capital of million at january  as compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million since the fiscal year ended december  other current assets increased million and total current liabilities increased million 
the company had a credit facility with us bancorp equipment finance  inc in that allowed it to borrow up to million  which was available through december  on december   the company extended the term through april  the agreement allows the company to borrow at plus the year interest rate swap published in the federal reserve statistical release 
the company utilized approximately million of this line for two new restaurants located in indiana and louisiana during the fourth quarter of during fiscal year  the company had received separate commitments from two lenders for financing 
the commitments were for obligations up to million in the aggregate for property development 
the credit facility with merrill lynch was available through october  with an interest rate equal to the year swap rate plus basis points 
the credit facility with cnl franchise network  lp cnl was available through december  the agreement committed cnl to enter into a sale leaseback transaction for properties to be developed and operated by the company as checkers or rally s restaurants 
both commitments expired under their original terms 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year current year operating cash flows are largely attributable to current profits net of 
table of contents non cash expenses  a million decrease in outstanding accounts receivable and a million increase in accrued liabilities  partially offset by a million increase to notes receivable and a million decrease in accounts payable 
cash flow used for investing activities was million and related primarily to million in capital expenditures and renovations as well as million for the acquisition of seven restaurants in jacksonville  florida 
these expenditures were partially offset by proceeds of million from the sale of restaurants and other capital assets 
cash used by financing activities was million 
we paid down principal of million and million on outstanding debt in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the company purchased treasury stock for million and decreased restricted cash by million 
these outlays were partially offset by receipts of million from the exercise of stock options during the year ended january  along with million borrowed against the company s line of credit with us bancorp equipment finance  inc we continue to evaluate the company s capital structure and refinancing opportunities 
we have capital lease receivables for certain restaurants previously sold which are subject to capital lease and mortgage obligations for which we continue to be the primary obligor  and have equivalent liabilities recorded 
the amount of capital lease receivables as of january  was million 
the company  as original lessee  has also subleased certain land associated with the sale of company operated restaurants under operating leases 
the revenue from these subleases is offset against rent expense  as we continue to be responsible for the rent payments to the original lessors 
sublease rental income recorded for january   december  and december   was million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to total approximately million 
these expenditures include the development of new restaurants  the remodeling of existing restaurants as well as other capital equipment and improvements on operating restaurants 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that our existing cash at january   the expected cash provided from operations  and the available credit facility with us bancorp equipment finance  inc will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
the company is subject to certain restrictive financial and non financial covenants under certain of its debt agreements  including ebitda and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants for fiscal year critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financials statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions we consider reasonable at the time of making those estimates 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or using different assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition franchise fees and area development franchise fees are generated from the sale of rights to develop  own and operate restaurants 
such fees are based on the number of potential restaurants in a specific area which the franchisee agrees to develop pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement between the company and the franchisee and are recognized as income when substantially all of the company s obligations per location are satisfied generally at the opening of the restaurant 
franchise fees are nonrefundable 
franchise 
table of contents fees and area development franchise fees received prior to substantial completion of the company s obligations are deferred 
the company receives royalty fees from franchisees based on a percentage of each restaurant s gross revenues 
royalty fees are recognized as earned 
gains associated with the sale of certain company operated restaurants to franchisees with associated mortgages and capital leases are recognized over the life of the related capital leases 
during fiscal years and  several company operated restaurants were sold to franchisees with associated mortgages and capital leases 
as a result of the sales  we have recorded lease receivables for those restaurants sold which are subject to capital lease and mortgage obligations 
the amount of capital lease receivables as of january  was approximately million 
we have recorded deferred gains of million from these sales since we continue to be responsible for the payment of the obligations to the original lessors and mortgagors 
the deferred gains are included in our consolidated balance sheet under the captions accrued liabilities current and deferred revenues for million and million  respectively and will be recognized over the next years 
additionally  the company has deferred approximately million of gains in accordance with sfas no 
 where notes receivable were accepted as consideration for sales of certain company operated restaurants 
these notes as well as the associated deferred gains are scheduled to be collected and recognized over the term of the notes  which are due over the next five years 
in september  the company recorded a deferred gain of million in accordance with sfas no 
related to the sales leaseback transaction for three parcels of surplus property in georgia that were swapped with three company operated restaurants located in florida 
the surplus reserve recorded under eitf was recharacterized as a deferred gain for the georgia properties acquired 
the deferred gain will be recognized over the remaining lease term 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following offers from current or potential franchisees for restaurants below carrying value  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires the write down of certain intangibles and tangible property associated with under performing assets 
in applying sfas no 
 we reviewed historical and projected cash flows of all restaurants and performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis where indicated for each restaurant based upon such results projected over a ten year period 
this period of time was selected based upon the lease term and the age of the related buildings 
impairments or recoveries are recorded to adjust the asset values to the amount recoverable under the undiscounted cash flow analysis  in accordance with sfas no 
the effect of applying these standards resulted in a reduction of property  equipment and intangible assets of approximately million in  million for the fiscal year and million for the fiscal year for further discussion  see note j summary of significant accounting policies valuation of long lived assets of the consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report on form k 
contingencies management s current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where a range of loss has been identified 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 

table of contents restaurant retirement costs reserves for restaurant relocations and abandoned sites consist of our estimates for the ongoing costs of each location which has been closed or was never developed 
those costs include rent  property taxes  costs associated with relocating the modular restaurant to a storage facility  and any other retirement costs 
the cash outlays for these costs have been estimated for the remaining terms of the lease obligations  ranging from less than one year to years 
although the company has negotiated out of several of these sites  the current economic outlook and lack of alternative investment opportunities have hindered the company s ability to successfully negotiate out of the remaining sites 
as a result  management believes that cash outlays for these sites will continue through lease maturity 
during fiscal  the company recognized a benefit of million for successful termination of certain remaining lease obligations and other adjustments based on review of total expected outflows 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the company to recognize income tax benefits and liabilities for loss carryforwards and other income tax assets and liabilities 
the tax benefits must be reduced by a valuation allowance in certain circumstances 
realization of the deferred tax benefits is dependant on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of any net operating loss carryforwards nol s 
the deferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided for as necessary 
during  the company reversed million of the valuation allowance 
at january   there is a valuation allowance of million recorded against approximately million of the gross deferred tax assets 
accounting for leases and leasehold assets the company accounts for leases and assets associated with leased property in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
we amortize leasehold assets over the shorter of ten years or the remaining lease term 
to the extent the assets are added after the initial lease start up period  generally one year  the depreciable life may extend into a subsequent option period 
likewise  for purposes of recognizing rent expense  the company utilizes the lease commencement date through the end of the lease or option term  unless renewal of lease options has been determined to be reasonably assured 
in the instance the company is obligated to pay rent based on a percentage of sales  such rent expense is recognized once the minimum sales volume is achieved 
we have subleased  under operating leases  land associated with the sale of company operated restaurants 
the revenue from these subleases is recorded as an offset against rent expense  as we continue to be responsible for the rent payments to the original lessors 
the sublease rental income recorded for january   december  and december   was million  million and million  respectively 
we have considered our exposure for both capital and operating subleases  and have recorded a loss accrual for those operating subleases with rents from tenants below the rents the company is obligated to pay under the original lease 
accrued self insurance the company was partially self insured for workers compensation claims up to  per occurrence on the first two claims and  per occurrence thereafter 
we utilize third party actuarial experts estimates of expected losses based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as our own estimates based on our actual historical data 
these assumptions are adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater number of claims occur compared to what was estimated or the cost of those claims is higher than anticipated  reserves might not be sufficient and additional expense may be recorded 
should the actual experience be more favorable than estimated  a resulting expense reduction may be recorded 
the company is partially self insured for general liability up to  per claim and automotive liability losses subject to per occurrence and aggregate annual liability limitations as well 
the company maintains million in restricted cash as of january  as collateral securing self insured workers compensation claims until they are settled 
the company is also self insured  subject to umbrella policies  for health care claims for eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and limitations 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which addresses accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of that company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r 
table of contents requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for public companies in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  the company projects the compensation expense associated with adopting sfas r will approximate  in for the rd and th quarters of this estimate applies only to options issued but not yet vested 
options issued after the effective date will increase compensation expense above this estimate 
refer to note d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a proforma calculation of the effect non cash compensation has had on current and prior year financial results 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin 
fin was revised with fin r in december it requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin r is effective for all entities subject to this interpretation no later than the end of the first period that ends after march  the company has concluded that there are no variable interest entities that require consolidation 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses accounting and financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated present value of the asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long lived asset 
this statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted the standard effective december   and have recorded the impact of such obligations on our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations for estimated costs to return the premises to their previous states for those leased premises with such contractual obligations 
the depreciable base of property and equipment was increased by  net of accumulated depreciation of  for the cumulative effect of the change as of the end of our fiscal year december  the asset retirement obligation  included in other long term liabilities  recorded for the cumulative effect of the change as of december  was  the impact on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  was  of which  is reflected as a cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas no

the amounts presented for these commitments include an interest component 
risks factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition the following risk factors and others that we may add from time to time  are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements 
we may experience operating losses if we cannot sustain our current sales volume 
in years prior to fiscal  the company experienced significant losses in several previous years 
while we have had net income in and thereafter  we cannot assure you that we will not have a loss in the current and future fiscal years 
our prior years losses were primarily caused by impairment charges related to lower restaurant sales at certain restaurants during these periods  and these losses may occur again if we are unable to sustain our current level of sales 
our available cash is limited by our debt service obligations 
at january   we had outstanding long term debt and capital lease obligations of approximately million  pursuant to which we are required to make principal  interest and lease payments 
during fiscal  we paid million in interest on our long term debt 
our debt service and capital lease obligations limit our available cash flow 
our debt and lease agreements contain financial covenants 
we are subject to certain restrictive financial and non financial covenants under certain of our debt and lease agreements  including ebitda and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
though we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants at january   if we are unable to make the required interest payments or to comply with the provisions of our debt covenants  our creditors may accelerate the due date of our debt and foreclose upon the operating assets we used to secure these obligations 
any such actions would adversely affect our operations and strain our cash flow 
we may incur substantial liability arising from lawsuits to which we are a party 
we are parties to the litigation described in item note d commitments and contingencies litigation  in this filing 
although we cannot determine at this time the outcome of the lawsuits to which we are a party  if the result in one or more 
table of contents of the cases is adverse to us  the potential liability could be material 
in addition  we believe that the costs of defending these actions could be significant 
the litigation matters include disputes with our franchisees and include claims of fraud and violations of state franchise laws 
there are many risks associated with the food services industry 
the food service industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes  national  regional  and local economic conditions  demographic trends  traffic patterns and the type  number  and location of competing restaurants 
food service chains can also be adversely affected by publicity resulting from food quality  illness  injury or other health concerns including food borne illness claims stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants 
claims relating to foreign objects or food borne illness are common in the food services industry and a number of such claims may exist at any given time 
dependence on frequent deliveries of produce and supplies also subjects food service businesses such as ours to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability  quality  and cost of ingredients 
in addition  material changes in  or our failure to comply with  applicable federal  state  and local government regulations  and factors such as inflation  increased food  labor  and employee benefits costs  regional weather conditions and the availability of an adequate number of experienced managers and hourly employees may also adversely affect the food service industry in general and our results of operations and financial condition 
the quick service restaurant industry is intensely competitive and our operating results may be adversely affected by our need to adjust our operations to meet this competition 
there is intense competition in the quick service restaurant industry which can adversely affect our operations 
we expect to continue to experience intense competition  especially from the major chains  which have substantially greater financial resources and longer operating histories then us  and dominate the quick service restaurant industry 
we compete primarily on the basis of food quality  price and speed of service 
a significant change in pricing or other marketing strategies by one or more of our competitors could have a material adverse impact on our sales  earnings and growth 
in order to compete with each other  all of the major quick service chains have increasingly offered selected food items and combination meals at discounted prices 
we anticipate that the major quick service hamburger chains will continue to offer promotions of value priced meals  many specifically targeting the 
price point at which we sell many of our products 
as a result  we cannot rely on low prices to give us a competitive advantage 
our growth strategy is dependent upon franchisees 
as of january   restaurants were operated by us  and were operated by franchisees 
our growth strategy will continue to be heavily dependent upon the opening of new restaurants owned by franchisees  and the manner in which they operate and develop their restaurants to promote and develop our concepts and our reputation for quality food and speed of service 
the opening and success of restaurants is dependent on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable sites  the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for such sites  permitting and regulatory compliance  the ability to hire and train qualified personnel  the financial and other capabilities of our franchisees and area developers  and general economic and business conditions 
many of these factors are beyond our control or the control of our franchisees and area developers 
we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees that are outside of our control 
franchisees are independent operators and are not our employees 
we provide training and support to franchisees  but the quality of franchised restaurant operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control 
consequently  area developers and individual franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements  or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel 
if they do not  our image and reputation may suffer  and system wide sales could decline 
the ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel is extremely important and our failure to do so could adversely affect us 
we are heavily dependent upon the services of our officers and key management involved in restaurant operations  marketing  finance  purchasing  expansion  human resources and administration 
the loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
other than our chief executive officer and vice president of operations  we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our employees 
our success is also dependent upon our franchisee s ability to attract and maintain a sufficient number of qualified managers and other restaurant 
table of contents employees 
qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in some geographic areas 
the inability to recruit and retain such individuals may result in higher employee turnover in existing restaurants  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our resources may be strained by implementing our business strategy 
our growth strategy may place a strain on our management  financial and other resources 
to manage our growth effectively  we must maintain the level of quality and service at our existing and future restaurants 
we must also continue to enhance our operations  financial and management systems and locate  hire  train and retain experienced and dedicated operating personnel  particularly restaurant managers 
we may not be able to effectively manage any one or more of these aspects of our expansion 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if we are not able to anticipate and react to our food and labor costs  our profitability could be adversely affected 
our restaurants operating costs consist principally of food and labor costs 
our profitability is dependent in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and labor costs 
various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions governmental regulation and increases in minimum wage requirements  may affect our food and labor costs 
we may not be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs  whether through purchasing practices  menu composition or menu price adjustment in the future 
in the event that food or labor price increases cause us to increase our menu prices  we face the risk that our customers will choose our competitors if their prices are lower 
failure to react to changing food costs  or retaining customers if we are forced to raise menu prices  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our ability to develop new franchised restaurants and to enforce contractual rights against franchisees may be adversely affected by franchise laws and regulations  which could cause our franchise revenues to decline and adversely affect our growth strategy 
as a franchisor  we are subject to regulation by both the federal trade commission and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises 
our failure to obtain or maintain approvals to sell franchises would cause us to lose franchise revenues 
if we are unable to sell new franchises  we will not be able to accomplish our growth strategy 
in addition  state laws that regulate substantive aspects of our relationships with franchisees may limit our ability to terminate or otherwise resolve conflicts with our franchisees 
because we plan to grow primarily through franchising  any impairment of our ability to develop new franchised restaurants will negatively affect us and our growth strategy more than if we planned to develop additional company restaurants 
our quarterly results may fluctuate and could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors  resulting in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly and yearly results have varied in the past  and we believe that our quarterly operating results will vary in the future 
for this reason  you should not rely upon our quarterly operating results as indications of future performance 
in some future periods  our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall 
factors such as seasonality and unanticipated increases in labor  food  insurance or other operating costs may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate 
you should not rely on our same store sales as an indication of our future results of operations because they may fluctuate significantly 
a number of factors have historically affected  and will continue to affect  our same store sales results 
such factors include unusually strong sales performance by new restaurants operated at least one year  competition  regional and national economic conditions  consumer trends  and our ability to execute our business strategy effectively 
significant fluctuations could result in lower than planned sales  adversely impacting our profitability goals and straining cash flow 
future sales of shares of our common stock could decrease its market price 
as of february   we had  shares of our common stock outstanding and grants of options outstanding to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock 
possible or actual sales of any of these shares under rule or otherwise may in the future decrease the price of shares of our common stock 

table of contents our largest stockholders still have a significant influence on matters put to a vote 
the percentage interest held by our largest shareholders may have significant influence on elections of directors and other matters put to a vote of stockholders 
ownership percentages of such large shareholders can be found under the heading security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management in the company s definitive proxy statement to be used in connection with the company s annual meeting of stockholders  which will be filed with the commission on or about april  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations our exposure to financial market risks is the impact that interest rate changes and availability could have on our debt 
borrowings under our primary debt facilities and capital lease obligations bear interest ranging from to 
an increase in short term and long term interest rates would result in a reduction of pre tax earnings 
substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the company and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk we purchase certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within the company s control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements have been negotiated in advance to minimize price volatility 
typically  the company uses these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  the company believes it will be able to address commodity cost increases  which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting its menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices could result in lower restaurant level operating margins
