item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of rai s business  initiatives  critical accounting policies and its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
following the overview and discussion of business initiatives  the critical accounting policies disclose certain accounting policies that are material to rai s results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented in this report 
the discussion and analysis of rai s results of operations is presented in two comparative sections  compared with and compared with disclosures related to liquidity and financial condition complete management s discussion and analysis 
you should read this discussion and analysis of rai s consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of december  and and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  overview and business initiatives rai was incorporated in the state of north carolina on january   for the purpose of facilitating the transactions to combine rjr tobacco with the us cigarette and tobacco business of b w 
the combination transactions combined the businesses of two of the largest industry participants with strong brands  creating efficiencies and cost reductions through synergies 
upon completion of the combination transactions on july   b w owned  shares  or of rai s outstanding common stock 
the consideration assigned to the shares issued to and held by b w was approximately billion  or per share  based on the average closing price of rjr common stock during the five day period beginning two days before and ending two days after the announcement on october   of the combination transactions 
previous rjr stockholders were issued common shares of rai in exchange for their existing rjr shares  on a one for one basis  resulting in their ownership of approximately of rai s common stock outstanding at the closing 
no indebtedness for borrowed money of b w was assumed by rai 
the transaction is expected to be tax free to rjr stockholders  and is being treated as a purchase of the b w net assets by rjr for financial accounting purposes 
the consolidated financial statements of rai include results of acquired operations subsequent to july  as part of the combination transactions  b w transferred to rjr tobacco  along with its us operations  cash of million  an amount equal to its pre closing accrued liabilities under the msa and related agreements 
rjr tobacco and the us cigarette and tobacco operations of b w were combined in an indirect subsidiary of rai  referred to as rjr tobacco 
the minimum working capital requirement  as defined in the combination transactions  was met and no additional cash was required 
rjr tobacco  and in certain instances  rai  have agreed to indemnify b w and its affiliates for  among other things  all liabilities arising before or after the closing that relate to b w s us cigarette and tobacco business 
these liabilities include b w s historic and future tobacco related litigation liabilities and all liabilities under the msa and other state settlement agreements 
b w will indemnify rai and its subsidiaries to the extent the pre closing msa liabilities paid by rai exceed  and rai will indemnify b w to the extent the pre closing msa liabilities paid by rai are less than  the cash amount contributed by b w to rai at closing 
as part of the combination transactions  rai paid million in cash to acquire from an indirect subsidiary of bat  all of the capital stock of cigarette manufacturers supplies inc  which owns all of the capital stock of lane 
lane manufactures or distributes cigars  roll your own  cigarette and pipe tobacco brands  including dunhill and captain black tobacco products 
bat will retain the rights to use dunhill and other bat trademarks outside the united states 
as part of the combination transactions  rjr contributed all of the capital stock of santa fe to rai in exchange for shares of series b preferred stock of rai 
upon completion of the combination transactions  santa fe became a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of rai 
both santa fe and lane operate as independent subsidiaries of rai 
the headquarters and operations of each of rai and rjr tobacco are located in winston salem  north carolina 

table of contents rai s operating subsidiaries include rjr tobacco  santa fe  lane and gpi 
rai s single reportable operating segment  rjr tobacco  is the second largest cigarette manufacturer in the united states 
santa fe manufactures and markets cigarettes and other tobacco products under the natural american spirit brand  primarily in the united states 
lane manufactures or distributes cigars  roll your own  cigarette and pipe tobacco brands 
gpi manufactures and exports cigarettes to us territories  us duty free and overseas military and manages a contract manufacturing business 
rai s operating subsidiaries primarily conduct business in the highly competitive us cigarette market  which has a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants 
the us cigarette market is believed to be a mature market  and overall consumer demand is expected to continue to decline over time 
trade inventory adjustments may result in short term changes in demand for rjr tobacco s products if  and when  wholesale and retail tobacco distributors adjust the timing of their purchases of product to manage their inventory level 
however  rjr tobacco believes it is not appropriate for it to speculate on external factors that may impact the purchasing decision of the wholesale and retail tobacco distributors 
over time  competition between brands has been based primarily on brand positioning and price  as well as product attributes and packaging  consumer loyalty  promotions  advertising and retail presence 
cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing  substantial marketing support  retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve a brand s market position or to introduce a new brand 
rai s operating subsidiaries are committed to building and maintaining a portfolio of strong brands 
rjr tobacco s marketing programs are designed to strengthen brand image  build brand awareness and loyalty  and switch adult smokers of competing brands 
rjr tobacco has repositioned or introduced brand styles and line extensions designed to build each brand s equity and attract adult smokers of competitive brands  but there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
in addition to building strong brand equity  rjr tobacco s marketing approach utilizes a retail pricing strategy  including discounting at retail  to defend its brands shares of market against competitive pricing pressure 
competitive discounting has increased significantly as a result of higher state excise taxes and the growth of deep discount brands 
deep discount brands are brands manufactured by companies that are not original participants in the msa  and accordingly  do not have cost structures burdened with msa payments to the same extent as the original participating manufacturers 
starting in mid  rjr tobacco s largest competitor significantly increased promotional spending 
these increases  together with the continued strength of the deep discount price tier of the market and the impact of substantially higher state excise taxes  resulted in an adverse business environment 
to maintain competitive prices  rjr tobacco increased its promotional spending 
during the fourth quarter of  rjr implemented a restructuring plan in an effort to streamline its cost structure and improve long term earnings 
the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction  which was substantially completed in  and the reclassification of certain non tobacco businesses as held for sale 
in april  in response to continuing challenges of an intensely competitive environment  rjr announced changes to rjr tobacco s approach to the marketplace and its plan to realign the cost structures of rjr tobacco and rjr 
these initiatives included significant cost reductions and a new brand portfolio strategy focused on rjr tobacco s two premium growth brands to optimize profitability  which resulted in restructuring and impairment charges during and additionally  during the fourth quarter of  rjr tobacco transferred ownership of its merchandising fixtures to the cigarette retailers  which resulted in an impairment 
for more information about these initiatives  related costs and savings  see results of operations 
since the business combination  rjr tobacco has developed a new brand portfolio strategy  which took effect at the beginning of the new strategy establishes three categories of brands investment  selective support and non support 
the investment brands are camel and kool  which will receive significant resources focused on accelerating their share of market growth 
the selective support brands include two full price brands  winston and salem  and two savings brands  doral and pall mall  and will receive 
table of contents limited support in an effort to optimize profitability 
the remaining non support brands will be managed to maximize short term profitability 
critical accounting policies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts in rai s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding the business operations  financial condition and results of operations of rai and its subsidiaries 
purchase accounting rai accounts for business combination transactions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  referred to as sfas  no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that rai allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their fair values as of the acquisition date 
estimates of fair values for property  plant and equipment  trademarks and other identifiable intangibles are based on independent appraisals  pension and post retirement obligations are based on actuarial studies  and other accounts are based on management s best estimates using assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
in addition  depreciation of property  plant and equipment and amortization of trademarks and other intangibles with finite lives  are directly related to estimated fair values and estimated useful lives determined as of the acquisition date 
the determination of fair values involves considerable estimation and judgment 
among other things  it requires developing forecasts of cash flows and discount rates for trademarks and other intangibles  selecting appropriate valuation bases and methodologies for property  plant and equipment  determining appropriate actuarial assumptions for pensions and post retirement plans  and determining the number and timing of employees to be terminated or relocated and the associated costs 
the value of goodwill and trademarks and other intangibles with indefinite lives will be subjected to annual impairment testing that could result in future impairment charges 
changes in the useful lives of property  plant and equipment  trademarks or other intangibles could impact depreciation or  in certain situations  impairment charges 
for further information related to accounting of or the business combination  see note to consolidated financial statements 
tobacco related litigation rai and rjr tobacco disclose information concerning tobacco related litigation for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote 
rjr tobacco and its affiliates record their legal expenses and other litigation costs and related administrative costs as selling  general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred 
as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements  rjr tobacco and its affiliates have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions  proceedings or claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars 
unfavorable judgments awarding compensatory damages  punitive damages and or fines have been returned against rjr tobacco in the engle class action case  reversed by the intermediate appellate court on may   the scott class action case  a small number of individual smoking and health cases  a broin ii flight attendant ets case and a california state law enforcement action 
however  rjr tobacco believes that it has numerous bases for successful appeals in its pending cases  and both rjr tobacco and rai believe they have a number of valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously 
rjr tobacco expensed approximately  during for kenyon v 
r 
j 
reynolds tobacco co  discussed in business litigation affecting the cigarette industry in item  and during rjr tobacco accrued million as a pre acquisition contingency related to the business combination for boerner v 
brown williamson and million for eastman v 
brown williamson 
however  rai s management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against rjr tobacco or its affiliates  when viewed on an individual basis  is not 
table of contents probable 
accordingly  no other liability for tobacco related litigation currently is recorded in rai s consolidated financial statements 
rai and rjr tobacco will record any loss related to tobacco litigation at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when the reasonable estimate is a range  the recorded loss will be the best estimate within the range 
if no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount of the range will be recorded 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of the tobacco related legal actions  proceedings or claims could ultimately be decided against rjr tobacco or its affiliates  including rai 
any unfavorable outcome of such actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of rai or its subsidiaries 
settlement agreements as discussed in business litigation affecting the cigarette industry in item and note to consolidated financial statements  rai s operating subsidiaries are participants in the msa and other state settlement agreements related to governmental health care cost recovery actions 
their obligations and the related expense charges under the msa and other settlement agreements are subject to adjustments based upon  among other things  the volume of cigarettes sold by the operating subsidiaries  their relative market share and inflation 
since relative market share is based on cigarette shipments  the best estimate of the allocation of charges under these agreements is recorded in costs of products sold as the products are shipped 
settlement expenses under these msa and other settlement agreements recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of income were billion in  billion in and billion in rjr tobacco estimates that its settlement charges will be approximately billion in  will exceed billion in and will exceed billion in and thereafter  subject to adjustments  including those discussed above 
adjustments to these estimates  which historically have not been significant  are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
intangible assets intangible assets include goodwill  trademarks and other intangibles 
trademarks and other intangible assets are capitalized when acquired 
as of january   rjr adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of the initial adoption of sfas no 
on goodwill and trademarks and for additional impairment charges in connection with rai s ongoing application of sfas no 
rai generally engages an independent appraisal firm to assist it in determining the fair value of its reporting units and trademarks 
the determination of fair value involves considerable estimates and judgment 
in particular  the fair value of a reporting unit involves  among other things  developing forecasts of future cash flows  determining an appropriate discount rate  and when goodwill impairment is implied  the determination of the fair values of individual assets and liabilities  including unrecorded intangibles 
although rai believes it has based its impairment testing and impairment charges on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
as a result of the competitive changes in the tobacco industry during  and the business combination transactions in  rjr and rai initiated comprehensive changes in their strategies and cost structure 
management can not predict the impact that the current competitive environment and rai s strategic initiatives may have on the fair value of goodwill  trademarks and other intangibles in future periods 
pension and postretirement benefits rai sponsors a number of non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of the employees of rai and its subsidiaries  and also provide certain health and life insurance benefits for retired employees and their dependents 
these benefits are generally no longer provided to employees hired on or after january  
table of contents as part of the business combination transactions  rai assumed certain pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related assets of former b w plans 
the liability for the projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets was recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
all previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss  unrecognized prior service cost  or unrecognized transition obligation or asset existing at the date of the business combination were eliminated 
as a result of the business combination  the pension benefit obligation and pension assets increased by billion and billion  respectively and the postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement assets increased by million and million  respectively 
pension expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
postretirement benefit expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
because pension and other postretirement obligations will ultimately be settled in future periods  the determination of annual expense and liabilities is subject to estimates and assumptions 
with the assistance of independent actuarial firms  rai reviews these assumptions annually based on historic experience and expected future trends or coincidentally with a major event and modifies them as needed 
demographic assumptions such as termination of employment  mortality or retirement are reviewed periodically as expectations change 
gains or losses are annual changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions 
the minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses  as described in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  was included in pension expense 
prior service costs  which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments  are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period for active employees 
the market related value of plan assets excludes deferred asset gains of million and recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years 
if the market value of assets had been used to determine pension expense  the impact would have been a decrease to the costs of million 
approximately million is attributable to the expected return on asset component of expense and million is due to the gain loss amortization component 
the most critical assumptions and their sensitivity to change are presented below assumptions pension postretirement benefits benefits all plans weighted average assumption used to determine benefit obligations at december discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended december discount rate expected long term return on plan assets rate of compensation increase a discount rate of was used for the period from january  to july   and a weighted average discount rate of was used for the period from august  to december   to reflect the impact of the business combination 
a discount rate of was used for the period from january  to july   and a weighted average discount rate of was used for the period from august  to december   to reflect the impact of the business combination 
a discount rate of was used for the period from january  to august   and adjusted to a discount rate of for the period from september  to december   to reflect the impact of the restructuring plan 

table of contents the overall expected long term rate of return on assets assumptions for pension and postretirement assets are based on the target asset allocation for plan assets  long term capital markets forecasts for asset classes employed  and active management excess return expectations to the extent asset classes are actively managed 
assumption sensitivity assumed asset return and discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the benefit plans 
a one percentage point change in assumed discount rate for the pension plans and other postretirement plans would have the following effects percentage point percentage point increase decrease pensions postretirement pensions postretirement plans plans plans plans effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation a one percentage point change in assumed asset return would have the following effects percentage point percentage point increase decrease pensions postretirement pensions postretirement plans plans plans plans effect on net periodic benefit cost during  actual asset returns for rjr s pension assets were adversely impacted by the continued deterioration of the equity markets and declining interest rates 
additionally  corporate bond yields  which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations  continued to decline 
the negative asset returns and declining discount rates unfavorably affected rjr s pension plans funded status 
pension expense in was adversely impacted due to these factors and the lowering of the expected return on asset assumption from per annum for to per annum for during  plan assets increased million  as a result of the favorable equity market performance  partially offset by benefit payments 
pension benefit obligations increased during greater than expected due to a decline in discount rates 
however  at december   the pension benefit obligation of rjr s pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million 
during  pension plan assets increased billion  primarily due to the addition of billion assets assumed in the business combination and as a result of the favorable equity market performance  partially offset by benefit payments 
the pension benefit obligation increased billion  primarily due to the addition of billion for the former b w plans and the decline in discount rates  partially offset by benefit payments 
however  at december   the pension benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million 
during  rai assumed million for postretirement plan assets in the business combination 
the postretirement benefit obligation increased by million  primarily due to the addition of million for the former b w plans  partially offset by benefit payments 
at december   the postretirement benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by billion 
rai does not expect to pre fund any additional postretirement benefit obligations in the future 
pension expense in is expected to be within a range of million to million  compared with expense of million in  primarily due to the lower discount rate of 
postretirement benefit expense in is expected to be within a range of million to million  compared with expense of million in  primarily due to the lower discount rate of 
the amount by which the pension benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets could increase to the extent of a decline in the fair value of plan assets  as well as adverse changes in actuarial assumptions  including a reduction in the discount rate used to calculate the pension benefit obligation 

table of contents rai expects to contribute million to its pension plans in additional cash funding may be made in the future 
rai expects payments related to its postretirement plans to be million in on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  referred to as the act 
the act expanded medicare to include  for the first time  coverage for prescription drugs 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
rai sponsors retiree medical programs  which include coverage for prescription drugs 
rjr deferred financial recognition of this legislation until  which was permitted under fasb staff position fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  referred to as fsp rai adopted fsp in the third quarter of and as a result  net postretirement health care costs were reduced approximately million 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was reduced approximately million for the federal subsidy related to benefits attributed to past service 
this includes million for the former b w plans that is reflected in the benefit obligation assumed in the business combination 
as additional information becomes available regarding how to determine and collect the medicare part d subsidy  rai will review and possibly update these amounts 
differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
in recent years  actual results have varied significantly from actuarial assumptions 
in particular  pension plan assets have declined due to the overall decline in the capital markets  and pension and postretirement liabilities have increased as a result of the decline in the discount rate 
these changes have resulted in charges to comprehensive income 
these changes are expected to result in additional pension expense in future years and may also require additional cash funding of the pension obligations in the future 
additionally  postretirement expense is expected to decrease due to changes in plan benefits  partially offset by expected declines in the discount rate 
plan assets are invested using a combination of active and passive investment strategies 
active strategies employ multiple investment management firms 
managers within each asset class cover a range of investment styles and approaches and are combined in a way that controls for capitalization  style biases equity investments  and interest rate bets fixed income investments against related benchmark indices  while focusing primarily on issue selection as a means to add value 
risk is controlled through diversification among asset classes  managers  styles and securities 
risk is further controlled both at the manager and asset class level by assigning excess return and tracking error targets 
investment managers are monitored to evaluate performance against these benchmark indices and targets 
allowable investment types include us equity  us equity  fixed income  real estate  private equity investment and hedge funds 
the us equity fund is composed of common stocks of large  medium and small companies  which are predominantly us based

real estate includes publicly traded real estate investment trust securities 
the hedge funds invest as a limited partner in portfolios of primarily public securities  including equities and fixed income 
for pension assets  futures are used to equitize cash held by investment managers in order to approach fully invested portfolio positions 
otherwise  a small number of investment managers employ limited use of derivatives  including futures contracts  options on futures and interest rate swaps in place of direct investment in securities to gain efficient exposure to markets 
derivatives are not used to leverage portfolios

cigarettes are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states 
the federal excise tax per pack of cigarettes is 
all states and the district of columbia currently impose excise taxes at levels ranging from per pack in kentucky to in rhode island 
during  nine states increased their excise taxes

several states have pending legislation proposing excise tax increases 
in  the report of the advisory committee to the surgeon general of the us public health service concluded that cigarette smoking was a health hazard of sufficient importance to warrant appropriate remedial action 
since  federal law has required a warning statement on cigarette packaging 
since  television and radio advertising of cigarettes has been prohibited in the united states 
cigarette advertising in other media in the united states is required to include information with respect to the tar and nicotine yield of cigarettes  as well as a warning statement 
during the past four decades  various laws affecting the cigarette industry have been enacted 
in  congress enacted the comprehensive smoking education act 
among other things  the smoking education act establishes an interagency committee on smoking and health that is charged with carrying out a program to inform the public of any dangers to human health presented by cigarette smoking  requires a series of four health warnings to be printed on cigarette packages and advertising on a rotating basis  increases type size and area of the warning required in cigarette advertisements  and requires that cigarette manufacturers provide annually  on a confidential basis  a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes to the secretary of health and human services 
the warnings currently required on cigarette packages and advertisements are surgeon general s warning smoking causes lung cancer  heart disease  emphysema  and may complicate pregnancy  surgeon general s warning quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health  surgeon general s warning smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury  premature birth  and low birth weight  and surgeon general s warning cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide 
since the initial report in  the secretary of health  education and welfare now the secretary of health and human services and the surgeon general have issued a number of other reports which purport to find the nicotine in cigarettes addictive and to link cigarette smoking and exposure to cigarette smoke with certain health hazards  including various types of cancer  coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive lung disease 
these reports have recommended various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking 
in  the federal alcohol  drug abuse and mental health act was signed into law

if environmental tobacco smoke is identified as a toxic air contaminant  the air resources board is required to prepare a report assessing the need and appropriate degree of control of environmental tobacco smoke 
rjr tobacco cannot predict the form any future california regulation may take 
several states have enacted or have proposed legislation or regulations that would require cigarette manufacturers to disclose the ingredients used in the manufacture of cigarettes 
in september  the massachusetts department of public health announced its intention to hold public hearings on amendments to its tobacco regulations 
the proposed regulations would delete any ingredients reporting requirement 
the united states court of appeals for the second circuit previously affirmed a ruling that the massachusetts ingredient reporting law was unconstitutional 
mdph has proposed to inaugurate extensive changes to its regulations requiring tobacco companies to report nicotine yield ratings for cigarettes according to methods prescribed by mdph 
because mdph withdrew its notice for a public hearing in november  it is impossible to predict the final form any new regulations will take or the effect they will have on the business or results of operations of rjr tobacco

rai s operating companies that sell cigarettes in new york state have provided written certification to both the ofpc and the office of the attorney general for new york that each of their cigarette brand styles currently sold in new york has been tested and has met the performance standards set forth in the ofpc s regulations 
design and manufacturing changes were made for cigarettes manufactured for sale in new york to comply with the standard 
similar legislation is being considered in a number of other states 
varying standards from state to state could have an adverse effect on the business or results of operations of rjr tobacco 

table of contents a price differential exists between cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad and cigarettes manufactured for us sale 
consequently  a domestic gray market has developed in cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad  but instead diverted for domestic sales that compete with cigarettes that rjr tobacco manufactures for domestic sale 
the us federal government and all states  except massachusetts  have enacted legislation prohibiting the sale and distribution of gray market cigarettes 
in addition  rjr tobacco has taken legal action against certain distributors and retailers who engage in such practices 
forty four states have passed  and various states are considering  legislation to ensure nonparticipating manufacturers  referred to as npms  under the msa are making required escrow payments 
under this legislation  a state would only permit distribution of brands by manufacturers who are deemed by the states to be msa compliant 
failure to make escrow payments could result in the loss of a nonparticipating manufacturer s ability to sell tobacco products in a respective state 
early efforts to enact legislation  from to early  resulted in a range of npm laws  some containing only minimal requirements 
however  once the national association of attorneys general  referred to as naag  became involved in the legislative initiative  model complementary npm language was developed and introduced in the states where either no npm laws existed or where existing laws needed to be amended to bring them in line with the model language 
additionally  states have enacted  and several other states are considering  legislation that closes a loophole in the msa 
the loophole allows nonparticipating manufacturers to recover most of the funds from their escrow accounts 
to obtain the refunds  the manufacturers must establish that their escrow deposit was greater than the amount the state would have received had the manufacturer been a subsequent participating manufacturer under the msa 
naag has endorsed adoption of these legislative efforts 
following a challenge by npms  the united states district court for the southern district of new york has issued an order enjoining new york from enforcing allocable share legislation 
it is possible that npms will challenge allocable share legislation passed in other states 
finally  four states  alaska  michigan  minnesota and utah  have enacted equity assessments on npms products 
this legislative initiative has not been endorsed by naag 
thirty one states have passed and several additional states are considering statutes limiting the amount of the bonds required to file an appeal of an adverse judgment in state court 
the limitation on the amount of such bonds generally ranges from million to million 
such bonding statutes allow defendants that are subject to large adverse judgments  such as cigarette manufacturers  to reasonably bond such judgments and pursue the appellate process 
in six jurisdictions  connecticut  maine  massachusetts  new hampshire  vermont and puerto rico  the filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays the judgment of the trial court 
on october   the president signed the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of  referred to as fetra  eliminating the us government tobacco production controls and price support program 
the buyout of tobacco quota holders provided for in fetra is funded by a direct quarterly assessment on every tobacco product manufacturer and importer  on a market share basis measured on volume to which federal excise tax is applied 
the aggregate cost of the buyout is approximately billion  payable over ten years 
as a result of the tobacco buyout legislation  the msa phase ii obligations established in and scheduled to expire by the end of will be continued  but will be offset against the tobacco quota buyout obligations 
rjr tobacco s annual payments for and thereafter were estimated to be approximately million per year 
rai s operating subsidiaries will record the fetra assessment on a quarterly basis upon required notification of assessments 
accrued but unpaid msa phase ii obligations will be reversed as the right to offset such obligations is triggered 
contingent liabilities for liquidation of quota tobacco stock will be recorded when an assessment is made 
rjr tobacco estimates that its overall share of the buyout will approximate billion to billion prior to deducting permitted offsets under the msa and expected cost savings on domestic leaf purchases as a result of the elimination of the tobacco quota program 
on december   the north carolina business court held that rjr tobacco was entitled to a refund of its first three quarterly msa phase ii payments made for of approximately million  and was not obligated to make its fourth quarter payment  of approximately million 
this decision has been 
table of contents appealed to the north carolina supreme court
