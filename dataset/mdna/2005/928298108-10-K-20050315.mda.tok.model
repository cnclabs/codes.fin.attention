item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview vishay intertechnology  inc is an international manufacturer and supplier of passive and active electronic components  including resistors  capacitors  inductors  strain gages  load cells  force measurement sensors  displacement sensors  photoelastic sensors  power mosfets  power conversion and motor control integrated circuits  transistors  diodes and optoelectronic components 
electronic components manufactured by vishay are used in virtually all types of electronic products  including those in the computer  telecommunications  military aerospace  instrument  automotive  medical  and consumer electronics industries 
vishay operates in two segments  passive components and active components 
passive components include resistors  capacitors  and inductors 
we include in this segment our measurements group  which manufactures and markets strain gages  load cells  transducers  instruments and weighing systems whose core components are resistors that are sensitive to various types of mechanical stress 
active components include transistors  diodes  rectifiers  certain types of integrated circuits and optoelectronic products 
our active segment includes our owned subsidiary  siliconix 
the passive components business had historically predominated at vishay until the purchase of general semiconductor in november  after which the lead position shifted to the active business 
with the acquisition of bccomponents in december  revenues from our active and passive businesses are essentially split evenly 
consolidated sales for the year ended december  were billion  compared to sales of billion for the year ended december  net earnings for the year ended december  were million or per share  compared to net earnings of million or per share for the year ended december  earnings for the year ended december  were impacted by restructuring and severance costs of million  asset write downs of million  losses on purchase commitments of million  write downs of inventory of million  a write off of purchased in process research and development of million  partially offset by a favorable settlement of an outstanding note receivable of million 
these items and their related tax effects  net of a favorable tax settlement  reduced earnings by per share 
earnings for the year ended december  were impacted by restructuring and severance costs of million  asset write downs of million  a loss on extinguishment of debt of million  losses on purchase commitments of million  and write downs of tantalum and palladium inventories on hand to then market value of million  offset by a gain on an insurance claim of million 
these items and their tax related consequences had a negative effect on earnings per share 
strong financial results for the first half of followed an economic recovery that began in the active business during the third quarter of and continued in the passive business in the fourth quarter of by the third quarter of  we noted a decline in orders from our distributors  but sales levels were still higher than in prior year periods 
there was a noticeable recovery of orders from distributors in the fourth quarter  but distributor orders remained at a book to bill ratio of less than orders from original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing services companies were substantially reduced in the fourth quarter of we believe these changes in ordering patterns are largely attributable to inventory levels in the various supply channels 
despite challenges in the second half of  we believe that the macro economy will remain friendly into financial metrics we utilize several financial measures and metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business 
these key financial measures and metrics include sales  gross profit margin  end of period backlog  and the book to bill ratio 
we also monitor changes in inventory turnover and average selling prices asp 
end of period backlog is one indicator of future sales 
however  if demand falls below customers forecasts  or if customers do not control their inventory effectively  they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog  in many instances without the payment of any penalty 
therefore  the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
another important indicator of demand in our industry is the book to bill ratio  which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period 
a book to bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods 
conversely  a book to bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining sales 
we focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory 
we define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our cost of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory computed using each quarter end balance for this same period 
a higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital 
pricing in our industry can be volatile 
we analyze trends and changes in average selling prices to evaluate likely future pricing 
the quarter to quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business 
the following table shows sales  gross profit margin  the end of period backlog  the book to bill ratio  the inventory turnover  and changes in asp for our business as a whole during the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of and through the fourth quarter of dollars in thousands th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter sales gross profit margin end of period backlog book to bill ratio inventory turnover change in asp vs 
prior quarter despite relatively friendly macroeconomic conditions  we noted deterioration in market conditions in the second half of  with sequential declines in sales and orders in the third and fourth quarters 
orders from original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing services companies declined significantly during the fourth quarter  with a book to bill ratio of in the third quarter  decreasing to a book to bill ratio of in the fourth quarter 
orders from distributors declined significantly in the third quarter  with some recovery noted in the fourth quarter 
the book to bill ratio was for distributors in the third quarter  as compared to in the fourth quarter 
the weak order rates have reduced our backlog as of the end of we believe these changes in ordering patterns are largely attributable to inventory levels in the various supply channels 
price declines were abrupt during the fourth quarter  particularly in the active components segment 
during this period  average selling prices declined by in the active components segment  and in the passive component segment 
this follows a year of historically low volatility in prices 
we expect pricing to be moderately lower for these volume and price declines in the second half of had a negative impact on our gross profit margins  particularly in the fourth quarter of despite these challenges in the second half of  we believe that the macro economy will remain friendly into capacity utilization capacity utilization is a reflection of product demand trends 
capacity load declined during the second half of in the passive components segment 
while certain specialty resistor lines were operating at up to of capacity  commodity resistors and inductors were operating at approximately to of capacity on average 
this level of capacity utilization was in line with utilization of to  but lower than the to utilization during the first half of during the second half of  our capacitor lines operated at approximately to of capacity  in line with average utilization of in  but below the approximately utilization rate during the first half of we continue to operate near full capacity in most of our front end active components facilities 
we have taken and will continue to take necessary steps to increase our capacity to accommodate increased demand 
these steps have included removing production bottlenecks in our fabrication facilities and securing additional equipment to expand our backend operations 
we have made significant investments in expanding capacity in our active components facilities  which will ramp up in future quarters 
our owned subsidiary  siliconix  has begun a project to add inch silicon wafer manufacturing capabilities at the fabrication facility in itzehoe  germany 
this project is expected to alleviate capacity constraints for high cell density wafers and reduce costs 
we expect siliconix to be eligible to receive the benefits of grants from the government of the german state of schleswig holstein related to these additional investments at the itzehoe facility 
except for any grant monies received  this significant increase in capital expenditures required to support our expansion program is expected to be funded almost entirely by cash flows from operations 
siliconix also maintains long term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front end capacity 
siliconix entered into a long term foundry agreement for semiconductor manufacturing with tower semiconductor in may  pursuant to which siliconix will purchase semiconductor wafers from and transfer certain technology to tower semiconductor 
siliconix will place orders valued at approximately million for the purchase of semiconductor wafers to be manufactured in tower s fab facility over a seven to ten year period 
the agreement specifies minimum quantities per month and a fixed quantity for the term of the agreement 
siliconix must pay for any short fall in minimum order quantities specified under the agreement 
the technology transfer from siliconix to tower has started and is estimated to be completed by the second quarter of  at which time siliconix will begin receiving wafers 
also in  siliconix entered into a five year foundry agreement for semiconductor manufacturing with a subcontractor in japan 
this agreement was a continuation and expansion of a previous technology transfer and business agreement for the manufacture of silicon wafers 
the agreement calls for siliconix to provide a rolling twelve month forecast of estimated requirements 
the first six months of this forecast are fixed as to quantity  and the subsequent six months are guaranteed not to be less than a quantity stated in the agreement 
thereafter  the monthly quantity may vary based on market demand 
under the agreement  siliconix must guarantee that its business with this subcontractor represents a minimum percentage of wafer requirements and is required to make its best efforts not to reduce the average monthly demand rate below a specified threshold 
acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we seek to expand through acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets  reputations for product quality and reliability  and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise 
also as part of this growth strategy  we seek to explore opportunities with privately held developers of electronic components  whether through acquisition  investment in non controlling interests  or strategic alliances 
during  we completed two acquisitions 
on august   we acquired substantially all of the assets of rfwaves  ltd  a fab less integrated circuit design house located in israel 
on september   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of aeroflex pearl river inc renamed vishay mic technology inc  the former thin film interconnect subsidiary of aeroflex  incorporated 
the total purchase price of these acquisitions was approximately million  which included cash payments of million plus stock options with an aggregate fair value of approximately million 
the purchase agreement for rfwaves includes provisions for vishay to pay additional consideration subject to rfwaves achieving operational targets through the payment of this additional consideration would not be material to vishay s financial position or cash flows 
purchased in process research and development represents the value assigned in a business combination to research and development projects of the acquired business that were commenced  but not completed at the date of acquisition  for which technological feasibility has not been established  and which have no alternative future use in research and development activities or otherwise 
amounts assigned to purchased in process research and development meeting the above criteria must be charged to expense at the date of consummation of the business combination 
a charge of million was recorded in the third quarter of in conjunction with the rfwaves acquisition 
for financial reporting purposes  the results of operations for rfwaves have been included in the actives segment from august  the results of operations for vishay mic technology have been included in the passives segment from september  the inclusion of these entities did not have a material impact on consolidated results for the third fiscal quarter of after allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an evaluation of their fair values  we recorded goodwill of million related to these acquisitions 
had these acquisitions occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements  the pro forma statements of operations would not be materially different than the consolidated statements of operations presented 
pending transactions we are continuously evaluating opportunities to expand our business  whether through acquisition  investment in non controlling interests  or strategic alliances 
when appropriate or necessary  we periodically announce the status of possible transactions to the public 
on december   we signed a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which vishay will acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of si technologies  inc for approximately million in cash  plus assumption of si technologies debt 
si technologies  traded on nasdaq  is a designer  manufacturer  and marketer of high performance industrial sensors and controls  weighing and factory automotive systems  and related products 
completion of the merger is subject to certain closing conditions  including the approval of the stockholders of si technologies 
the parties currently anticipate that the merger will be completed in the first half of as further described in note to our consolidated financial statements  on march   we announced our intention to commence a tender offer for all outstanding shares of siliconix not owned by vishay 
segments the following table shows sales  book to bill ratios  and gross profit margins broken out by segment for the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of dollars in thousands th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter passive components sales book to bill ratio gross profit margin active components sales book to bill ratio gross profit margin gross profit margins for the passive components segment include the impact of inventory write downs and losses on purchase commitments during the fourth quarters of and cost management we place a strong emphasis on reducing our costs 
one way we do this is by moving production to the extent possible from high labor cost markets  such as the united states and western europe  to lower labor cost markets  such as israel  mexico  the people s republic of china and eastern europe 
the percentage of our total headcount in lower labor cost countries is a measure of the extent to which we are successful in implementing this program 
this percentage was at the end of  as compared to at the end of  at the end of  at the end of  and at the end of we expect this percentage to be at the end of our long term target is to have between and of our headcount in lower labor cost countries 
we are placing particular emphasis on cost reduction in our capacitor lines  which were hardest hit by the market downturn experienced from to and where the business continues to suffer from worldwide overcapacity 
in  we completed the transfer of our power capacitor production from western europe to the czech republic and began moving our molded tantalum capacitor business to the people s republic of china 
we also began to consolidate our existing film capacitor line within the business of bccomponents 
in  we successfully transferred certain back end production from austria to hungary and the people s republic of china 
in august  we announced our intent to close our small signal diode assembly facility in colmar  france  and transfer the production to the people s republic of china and hungary 
our previous plan to transfer power diode production from the republic of china taiwan to the people s republic of china was intentionally delayed due to an increase in orders in the first half of we anticipate this transfer of production will be finalized by the third quarter of we also delayed the planned transfer of certain production lines from our bccomponents acquisition from germany to israel  but expect to complete this transfer of production by the fourth quarter of the restructuring plans we initiated in are expected to generate approximately million of annual cost savings 
furthermore  we are implementing an aggressive program in to reduce our annual fixed costs by an additional million 
in addition to completing the delayed projects described above  these programs include finalizing the planned closing of our norfolk  nebraska resistors plant  finalizing the production transfer of tantalum molded finishing from israel to the people s republic of china  integrating vishay mic technologies into our existing electro films business  transferring our film capacitor production to india and the people s republic of china after closing facilities in germany and the czech republic and reducing production in portugal and belgium  finalizing transfers of production from france to the czech republic and also streamlining various general and administrative costs 
israeli government incentives our production facilities in israel benefit from incentives offered by the israeli government for the creation of jobs and capital investment in that country 
these benefits take the form of government grants and reduced tax rates that are lower than those in the united states 
these reduced tax rates apply to specific approved projects and are normally available for a period of ten or fifteen years 
the lower tax rates in israel applicable to us ordinarily have resulted in increased earnings compared to what earnings would have been had statutory united states tax rates applied 
however  due to write downs of inventories and the losses on purchase commitments recorded in   and  the application of the israeli tax rates rather than united states tax rates resulted in decreases in net income of million in and million in  and an increase in net loss of million in  as compared to what earnings would have been had statutory united states tax rates applied 
israeli government grants are awarded to specific projects 
these grants are intended to promote employment in israel s industrial sector and are conditioned on the recipient maintaining certain prescribed employment levels 
grants are paid when the related projects become operational  and the israeli government approves the project 
israeli government grants  recorded as a reduction in the costs of products sold  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet reflected million in deferred grant income 
during the second quarter of  the government of israel informed us that because the headcount in our israeli subsidiaries decreased significantly over the previous months  the government intended to withhold up to million in grant monies otherwise due to us 
the grant  which was made by the israeli government under an economic stimulus program  was conditioned in part on the employment levels at certain of our israeli facilities 
the israeli government argued that we had not maintained employment at the required minimum levels 
during the fourth quarter of  we settled our dispute with the government of israel  and the government agreed to continue making grant payments to us 
under the terms of the settlement with the israeli government  we are required to employ at least an additional  employees in israel by december  in order to preserve our eligibility for the government grant and tax benefits 
under certain circumstances  we would be able to delay the december  deadline by one year 
we have hired an additional  employees to date and expect to comply with these requirements 
if we were no longer able to maintain the required level of employment in the future  we could be required to return some grant funds and repay certain tax benefits that were previously awarded to us 
the effect of the return of these funds would be to reduce our income in future years 
write downs of inventory and purchase commitments tantalum is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors 
we generally purchase this metal in powder or wire form  although in and early  when we perceived possible supply shortages  we also stockpiled quantities of tantalum ore 
in july and november of  we entered into purchase contracts with cabot corporation for tantalum powder and wire that committed us to minimum purchases of these materials at fixed prices through palladium is a precious metal used in the production of multi layer ceramic capacitors that we purchase under short term contracts 
in through  as a result of the general downturn in the electronics business  we experienced a significant decrease in capacitor sales 
prices of tantalum ore  powder and wire and of palladium also experienced significant declines 
as a result of these declines in prices  we recorded in costs of products sold write downs of tantalum inventories to then current market value of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
also as a result of this decline in prices  we recorded losses on purchase commitments for tantalum of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recorded in costs of products sold write downs of palladium inventories to then current market value of million  million and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively  and a loss on purchase commitments of million during the year ended december  losses on purchase commitments and the related liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet is estimated based on our contractually obligated purchase prices  expected market prices  and the mix of tantalum grades expected to be purchased 
the mix of tantalum grades expected to be purchased is within a range specified by the contracts 
the pricing trend for tantalum has been relatively stable since the mix of our purchases of tantalum grades during was significantly different than initially expected  which resulted in losses on purchase commitments of million being recorded in the year ended december  if the downward pricing trend were to resume  we could again be required to write down the carrying value of our tantalum inventory and record additional losses on our purchase commitments 
changes in our mix of tantalum grade purchases could also require us to record additional losses on our purchase commitments 
furthermore  one of our contracts for tantalum purchases provides for price reductions in if certain conditions are met 
our estimates of losses on purchase commitments are based on the assumption that we will not receive these conditional price reductions in we may be required to reverse a portion of these recorded losses if we meet all conditions to receive these price reductions 
the improvement in market conditions for our capacitor products in and the first half of resulted in increased usage of our tantalum inventories as compared to previous years 
however  we still anticipate  based on current and foreseeable demand for tantalum capacitors  that our minimum purchase commitments under the contracts with cabot will exceed our requirements over the terms of the contracts 
see contractual commitments below 
tantalum powder and wire have an indefinite shelf life  therefore  we believe that we will eventually utilize all of the material in our inventory or purchased under the contracts 
based on usage currently expected in  our inventory on hand plus our future purchase commitments represent approximately to years of usage 
we have little visibility of the demand for our tantalum capacitor products beyond twelve months 
it is almost certain that our actual requirements of tantalum will differ from those projected  and likely that the difference will be material 
write downs of raw materials inventory and losses on purchase commitments have the effect of improving gross margins in subsequent periods by reducing cost of products sold as inventory is utilized 
this effect cannot be precisely quantified in any specific reporting period  however  because of the large number of affected products and the impracticality of tracking raw material inventory usage on a product by product basis 
management estimates that the impact on margins for was between approximately million to million 
foreign currency in  we realized approximately of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
any third party sales not using the us dollar as the functional currency must be reported in the local currency and be translated at the weighted average exchange rate 
this translation has an impact on the net sales line of the consolidated statements of operations and also on the expense lines of the consolidated statements of operations 
we generally do not purchase foreign currency exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  although we do maintain cash balances in foreign currencies to act as a natural hedge of certain net exposures 
as of december  and  we had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale  title and risk of loss have been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery  we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
we historically have had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return 
beginning in  we modified these arrangements to allow distributors a limited credit for unsaleable products  which we term a scrap allowance 
consistent with industry practice  we also have a stock  ship and debit program whereby we consider  and grant at our discretion  requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors inventory  to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing 
in addition  we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor 
we record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period 
we calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments  but we believe they enable us to estimate reasonably future credits under the programs 
recording and monitoring of these accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions  with input from sales and marketing personnel and review  assessment and  if necessary  adjustment by corporate management 
while our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences  all of the methodologies take into account certain elements that management considers relevant  such as sales to distributors during the relevant period  inventory levels at the distributors  current and projected market trends and conditions  recent and historical activity under the relevant programs  changes in program policies  and open requests for credits 
in our judgment  the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals 
we do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories  so as to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period 
nevertheless  we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates 
accounts receivable our receivables represent a significant portion of our current assets 
we are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible 
we base these allowances on our historical collection experience  the length of time our receivables are outstanding  the financial circumstances of individual customers  and general business and economic conditions 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in first out method and market based upon net realizable value 
the valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates 
for instance  in the case of tantalum  we estimate market value by obtaining current quotations from available sources of supply 
for work in process goods  we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products 
for finished goods  we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold 
as noted  we recorded write downs of our tantalum and palladium inventories in and  and write downs of our palladium inventories in inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand  technology developments and market conditions 
estimates of restructuring and severance costs and purchase related restructuring costs in and  we recorded restructuring and severance costs of approximately million and million  respectively  related to our existing businesses 
in  we recorded restructuring costs of approximately million related to our acquisitions and million related to our existing businesses 
our acquisition related restructuring costs included  among other things  costs related to our acquisition of bccomponents in december our restructuring activities related to existing business were designed to reduce both our fixed and variable costs  particularly in response to the reduced demand for our products occasioned by the electronics industry downturn 
these included the disposition of fixed assets and the termination of employees 
acquisition related costs are included in the allocation of the cost of the acquired business and generally add to goodwill 
other restructuring costs are expensed during the period in which we determine that we will incur those costs  and all of the requirements for accrual are met 
because these costs are recorded based upon estimates  our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if this happens  we will have to adjust our estimates in future periods 
in the case of acquisition related restructuring costs  if our initial estimate is too high  this would generally require a change in value of the goodwill appearing on our balance sheet  but would not affect our earnings 
assuming our allocation of purchase price of the respective acquisition is finalized  if our initial estimate of purchase related restructuring costs is too low  we would be required to record additional expenses in future periods 
in the case of other restructuring costs  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods  if our initial estimates were too low  or to reverse part of the charges that we recorded initially  if our initial estimates were too high 
raw material write downs in and  we took charges against contractual commitments to purchase tantalum powder and wire through and wrote down our existing inventory of tantalum ore  powder and wire to then present market value 
we did this because the current market prices of tantalum are substantially below the prices at which we are committed to purchase tantalum in the future under long term contracts and the prices at which we were carrying our tantalum raw materials inventory 
these actions involved significant judgments on our part  including decisions of whether to take these charges and write downs  their timing and their amount 
we made the decision to take the charges and write downs after our management concluded that the substantial fall off in the demand for tantalum capacitors was likely to continue for the foreseeable future 
combining this assessment with the worldwide over capacity in tantalum production  we could not foresee when tantalum prices might recover from their currently depressed levels 
although we believe that both the charges and write downs as well as their timing were appropriate under the circumstances  our visibility for future demand and pricing is limited and the judgments made by our management necessarily involved subjective assessments 
losses on purchase commitments and the related liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet is estimated based on our contractually obligated purchase prices  expected market prices  and the mix of tantalum grades expected to be purchased 
the mix of tantalum grades expected to be purchased is within a range specified by the contracts 
there is no established market on which tantalum raw materials are regularly traded and quoted 
we based our determination of current market price on quotations from two suppliers of these materials 
we cannot say that the prices at which we could currently enter into contracts for the purchase of tantalum would be the same as these quoted prices 
had we made other assumptions on current and future prices for tantalum  the amount of the inventory write downs and the losses on our purchase commitments would have been different 
the pricing trend for tantalum has been relatively stable since the mix of our purchases of tantalum grades during was significantly different than initially expected  which resulted in losses on purchase commitments of million being recorded during that year 
if the downward pricing trend were to resume  we could again be required to write down the carrying value of our tantalum inventory and record additional losses on our purchase commitments 
changes in our mix of tantalum grade purchases could also require us to record additional losses on our purchase commitments 
furthermore  one of our contracts for tantalum purchases provides for price reductions in if certain conditions are met 
our estimates of losses on purchase commitments are based on the assumption that we will not receive these conditional price reductions in we may be required to reverse a portion of these recorded losses if we meet all conditions to receive these price reductions 
if tantalum prices were to recover in the future  we would not reverse the write downs that we have taken on our raw materials inventory  so that our cost of materials will continue to reflect these write downs regardless of future price increases in tantalum 
this could have the effect of increasing the earnings that we realize in future periods 
based upon similar considerations  we recorded write downs of our palladium inventory to market value in   and we also recorded a loss on purchase commitments for palladium of million in goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
these tests will be performed more frequently if there are triggering events 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using a comparable companies market multiple approach 
the comparable companies utilized in our evaluation are the members of our peer group included in the presentation of our stock performance in our annual proxy statement 
if the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  we would then perform the second step of the impairment test which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
we noted no impairment in our annual assessment of goodwill during the years ended december    or impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of our long lived assets  other than goodwill and tradenames  including property and equipment  and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset  changes in historical or projected operating performance and significant negative economic trends 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded asset write downs of million  million  and million  respectively 
asset write downs in and included amounts to reduce the carrying value of certain buildings which had been vacated as part of our restructuring activities  based on expected future selling prices 
asset write downs in and included charges to write down certain equipment to salvage value after we determined that it would not be used at other vishay locations subsequent to the completion of our restructuring plans 
income tax exposures our income tax returns in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions are presently under examination by the us internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities 
we believe that any potential tax assessment plus related interest and penalties  if any  have been sufficiently provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
these provisions are based on management s best estimate of potential tax exposures 
the completion of these examinations could have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows during the period in which they are resolved 
however  the resolution of these examinations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
results of operations statement of operations captions as a percentage of sales and the effective tax rates were as follows years ended december  costs of products sold gross profit selling  general administrative expenses operating income earnings before taxes minority interest net earnings effective tax rate reflects losses on purchase commitments of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
net sales net sales for the year ended december  increased by million or over the prior year 
the increase is attributable to strong volumes and positive foreign currency effects  partially offset by lower pricing 
despite the weaker market conditions during the second half of compared to the first half of  virtually all market segments performed better during versus telecom networks and mobile phones was particularly strong in asia and europe during the first half of automotive products have been solid  particularly in europe 
industrial products were strong throughout all of in the consumer products segment  we noted some softening in asia during the second half of the year  especially compared to the strong conditions noted during the first half of the year 
the european consumer products segment was relatively weak during during the second half of  we also noted a slow down in notebook computers and mobile phones  mainly impacting sales in asia 
the weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december  resulted in increases in reported revenues of million as compared to net sales for the year ended december  increased by million or over the prior year 
the increase primarily reflects the acquisitions of bccomponents in december  celtron technologies in october  blh and nobel in july and tedea huntleigh bv in september net sales of our existing businesses increased million  or 
the weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december  resulted in increases in reported revenues of million as compared to we deduct  from the sales that we record to distributors  allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns  scrapped product and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors 
we make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made  although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods 
we estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors  inventory levels at the distributors  current and projected market trends and conditions  recent and historical activity under the relevant programs  changes in program policies and open requests for credits 
we recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  as a percentage of gross sales   and  respectively 
actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
increases and decreases in these incentives are largely attributable to the then current business climate 
the decrease in the incentives since is indicative of the generally improving business climate affecting our distributors and the electronic component industry 
the decrease in is also attributable to changes in our pricing structure to more closely match the distributors pricing structure to their end use customers 
the decline in distributor orders noted in the second half of has not had a material impact on our distributor incentive programs 
we continue to monitor the factors described above in light of current market conditions 
gross profit and margins costs of products sold as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the prior year 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year

segments discussion and analysis of sales and gross profit margins for our passive and active segments are provided below 
passive components years ended december  in thousands net sales gross margin percentage net sales of passive components for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to the prior year 
the increase in net sales is attributable to volume increases in all passive component product lines and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by price declines 
volumes increased approximately in  which was offset by a decline in average selling prices versus the prior year 
the weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december  resulted in increases in reported revenues of million as compared to net sales of passive components for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to the prior year 
without the acquisitions of bccomponents  celtron technologies  blh and nobel  and tedea huntleigh  the passive components business sales would have increased by million or as compared to the prior year 
the organic increase in net sales was attributable to the volume increases in the resistor and inductor product lines and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by price declines 
several significant cost reduction programs have been initiated in all of the products lines  including facility combinations and shifting production to lower cost regions 
the impact of these cost savings plans has been partially offset by the underutilization of capacity in commodity products 
gross margins were for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
margins were affected negatively by raw material related write downs in both and during  we recorded write downs of million to reduce palladium inventories to market value 
we also recorded losses on tantalum purchase commitments of million and on palladium purchase commitments of million during during  we recorded write downs of million to reduce tantalum and palladium inventories to then current market value  and losses on purchase commitments for future delivery of tantalum of million 
the improvement in gross margins in is primarily due to lower inventory related charges in  higher volume  lower obsolescence costs  and our cost reduction programs  partially offset by lower prices 
gross margins were for the year ended december   as compared to negative for the prior year 
results for reflected average margins of for our resistor and inductor lines and for our capacitor lines 
margins were affected negatively by raw material related write downs in and  as market prices for these materials continued to decline 
as described above  during  we recorded inventory related charges of million 
in  we recorded losses on purchase commitments of tantalum of million and write downs of million on tantalum and palladium inventories 
active components years ended december  in thousands net sales gross margin percentage net sales of the active components business for the year ended december  increased million  or as compared to the prior year 
the increase in sales was primarily attributable to increased volumes and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by lower prices versus the prior year 
the weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december  resulted in increases in reported revenues of million as compared to our active components business was particularly impacted by the decline in distributor orders noted in the second half of despite these sequential declines in sales as compared to the first half of  demand was stronger across all product lines and virtually all market segments versus in particular  sales volume of products for end uses in mobile phones and networks  industrial products  and consumer products digital cameras and dvds was strong compared to the prior year 
volumes increased approximately in  which was offset by a decline in average selling prices versus the prior year 
the volume increase was due to improved market conditions  and also due to the absence of the sars related sales declines in asia  particularly at our siliconix subsidiary  which sells approximately of its products to customers in asia 
gross margins were  as compared to for the prior year 
the improvement in margins is attributable to higher volumes and lower costs 
net sales of the active components business for year ended december  increased by million  or  as compared to the prior year 
the active segment continued to experience pricing pressure in  especially during the first half of the year 
sales for the first half of actually decreased from the comparable period  primarily as a result of the sars outbreak in asia where siliconix sells approximately of its total sales 
the modest revenue growth for the year was fueled by a significant rebound in asian business during the second half of  driven by demand for computer components and by distributors restocking inventories 
gross margins were for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
margins were negatively impacted by product mix changes at siliconix  where there was a higher share of commodity products as compared to the comparable prior year periods 
also  because of capacity constraints that it had begun to experience  siliconix made greater use of subcontractors during  which had the effect of driving down margins 
siliconix s net sales for were million  compared to million in  a increase  and its gross profit margins declined from for to for selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses were of net sales for as compared to of net sales for the prior year 
the prior year included expenses due to the acquisition of bccomponents 
the reduction in this percentage is largely due to increased sales  but also reflects progress in our cost reduction initiatives 
these improvements  as a percentage of sales  were achieved despite increased costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance requirements 
sg a expenses for the year ended december  were of net sales as compared to of net sales for the prior year 
this increase was mainly due to the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of bccomponents 
restructuring and severance costs and related asset write downs our restructuring activities have been designed to cut both fixed and variable costs  particularly in response to the reduced demand for products occasioned by the electronics industry downturn experienced from to these activities include the closing of facilities and the termination of employees 
because costs are recorded based upon estimates  actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if the initial estimates are too low or too high  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods or to reverse previously recorded expenses 
we anticipate that we will realize the benefits of our restructuring through lower labor costs and other operating expenses in future periods 
we expect to continue to restructure our operations and incur restructuring and severance costs as explained in cost management above  and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we continued our restructuring activities during the year ended december   recording restructuring and severance costs of million and asset write downs of million 
the largest component of our restructuring costs relate to our decision to close our colmar  france small signal diode assembly facility and transfer production to other vishay facilities 
during the fourth quarter  we recorded restructuring and severance costs of million related to this closure 
of the million restructuring and severance costs recorded in  approximately million relates to workforce reduction expenses  and approximately million relates to other exit costs 
the asset write downs are related to plant closures and decisions not to utilize certain equipment in other locations 
as a result of restructuring activities initiated in  we expect an annual increase in gross profit of approximately million 
we recorded restructuring and severance costs for the years ended december   and of million  million  and million  respectively 
we also recorded asset write downs of million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
we continued to realize the expected savings in related to these restructuring charges  and we expect to continue to realize annual cost savings associated with the restructuring activities initiated in   and restructuring and severance costs are separate from plant closure  employee termination and similar integration costs we incur in connection with our acquisition activities 
these amounts are included in the costs of our acquisitions and do not affect earnings or losses on our statement of operations 
for a discussion of these costs  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
other income expense compared to interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to repayment of debt with the proceeds of lower interest rate debt issued in the third quarter of these proceeds  from our issuance of our convertible subordinated notes  were used to repay approximately million principal amount of general semiconductor s convertible notes  approximately million accreted principal amount of our liquid yield option notes lyons and million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the third quarter of additionally  on june   we repurchased million accreted principal amount of our lyons through the issuance of  shares of common stock 
the repurchase of the lyons is expected to reduce future interest expense by approximately million per year 
we recorded a loss of million for extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  on the redemption of million principal amount of the general semiconductor notes and the repurchase of million in accreted principal amount of our lyons 
also during  we recorded a gain of million on the receipt of insurance proceeds in excess of book value subsequent to the destruction of the thin film resistor facility of our electro films  inc subsidiary in warwick  rhode island 
that facility has now been completely rebuilt into a state of the art production center 
no comparable losses or gains were recorded in these items are reported on separate lines in the consolidated statement of operations

there were no comparable items in the year ended december  included a gain on expiration of an interest rate swap of million  and there was no comparable item in foreign exchange losses were incurred in both years due to the weakening of the us dollar 
the amount of the exchange loss is driven by the extent of currency fluctuation and by the timing of receipts and payments 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures  although we do maintain cash balances in foreign currencies to act as a natural hedge of certain net exposures 
interest income for increased as compared to  primarily attributable to an increase in invested cash and higher average interest rates 
royalty income was approximately million in and is expected to be higher in future periods due to the settlement of two patent infringement cases which we had initiated 
compared to interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million  as compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily a result of debt issued or assumed in the various acquisitions made in and the issuance in august of our million principal amount convertible subordinated notes due  net of debt repaid with the proceeds of these notes of million 
acquisition related debt included borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of million principal amount of unsecured loan notes  currently bearing interest at libor plus  in connection with the bccomponents acquisition in december as described above  we recorded a loss of million for extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  also during  we recorded a gain of million on the receipt of insurance proceeds in excess of book value

the amount of the exchange loss is driven by the extent of currency fluctuation and by the timing of receipts and payments 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures  although we do maintain cash balances in foreign currencies to act as a natural hedge of certain net exposures 
interest income for decreased as compared to  primarily attributable to lower average interest rates 
minority interest minority interest in earnings increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to an increase in net earnings of siliconix  of which we own of the outstanding shares 
minority interest in earnings decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in net earnings of siliconix 
income taxes the effective tax rate  based on earnings before income taxes and minority interest  for the year ended december  was as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
the effective tax rate for reflects the favorable settlement of a tax audit in germany  which resulted in a decrease in tax expense of million 
the effective tax rates reflect the fact that we could not recognize for accounting purposes the tax benefit of losses incurred in certain jurisdictions  although these losses are available to offset future taxable income 
under applicable accounting principles  we may not recognize deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards in jurisdictions where there is a recent history of cumulative losses  where there is no taxable income in the carryback period  where there is insufficient evidence of future earnings to overcome the loss history and where there is no other positive evidence  such as the likely reversal of temporary timing differences  that would result in the utilization of loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  reflecting tax expense  as compared to for the prior year  reflecting a tax benefit 
the effective tax rate in reflects the fact that we could not recognize for accounting purposes the tax benefit of losses incurred in certain jurisdictions  although these losses are available to offset future taxable income 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million as of december   of which million belonged to siliconix 
siliconix has its own board of directors which must approve transactions with vishay 
excluding cash held by siliconix  the remaining amount of million includes approximately million held by our non us subsidiaries 
under non us tax law  any repatriation of earnings and cash back to the united states would be deemed to be a dividend and would be subject to us income taxes  state income taxes  and foreign withholding taxes 
we continue to evaluate the impact of repatriation of earnings and cash pursuant to the american jobs creation act of  which was signed into law in october at the present time  we expect our cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries  including foreign subsidiaries of siliconix  to continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
cash flows from operations were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   despite increased earnings 
the decrease in cash flows from operations was primarily due to changes in working capital and the prepayment of million to tower semiconductor related to the semiconductor manufacturing agreement entered into by siliconix 
our financial condition at december  continued to be strong  with a current ratio current assets to current liabilities of to  compared with a ratio of to at december  the increase in this ratio in is primarily due to cash generated by operations 
our ratio of long term debt  less current portion  to stockholders equity was to at december  this ratio was to at december  the improvement in this ratio in is due to the reduction of debt subsequent to the issuance of shares of common stock to holders of our lyons who elected to exercise their option to require us to repurchase their lyons on june  holders of our lyons had the option to require us to purchase all or a portion of their lyons on june  at their accreted value of per  principal amount at maturity 
pursuant to the terms of the notes  we elected to pay the purchase price in vishay common stock 
holders representing approximately of outstanding lyons exercised their option 
we issued  shares of common stock as consideration in the purchase of approximately million accreted principal amount of the lyons 
the remaining lyons holders also have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on june   june   and june  at their accreted value on those dates  as set forth in the notes 
see also contractual commitments below 
even with the reduction of debt by million subsequent to our repurchase of the lyons  our debt levels have increased significantly since this is primarily attributable to acquisition activity 
additionally  in  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes  using a majority of the proceeds to repay other higher interest rate debt 
we maintain a secured revolving credit facility of million  which was extended in until may at december   an asian subsidiary had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility at december  letters of credit totaling million were issued under the revolving credit facility at december  accordingly  million was available under the revolving credit facility at december  the revolving credit facility restricts us from paying cash dividends and requires us to comply with other covenants  including the maintenance of specific financial ratios 
pursuant to the amended and restated credit facility agreement  we must maintain a tangible net worth of million plus of net income without offset for losses and of net proceeds of equity offerings since july  our tangible net worth at december   as calculated pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  was  million  which is million more than the minimum required under the related credit facility covenant 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by pledges of stock in certain significant subsidiaries and certain guarantees by significant subsidiaries 
the subsidiaries would be required to perform under the guarantees in the event that vishay failed to make principal or interest payments under the revolving credit facility 
our siliconix subsidiary is not a party to our revolving credit agreement 
certain of vishay s subsidiaries  not including siliconix  are permitted to borrow under the revolving credit facility 
any borrowings of these subsidiaries under the credit facility are guaranteed by vishay  including the borrowing by our asian subsidiary referred to above 
on may   we entered into a consent and first amendment to our revolving credit facility  effective as of may  the amendment provides for lender consent to the corporate restructuring of certain subsidiaries of vishay  permits subsidiary guarantees of certain equipment leases and revises and clarifies the conditions under which vishay and its subsidiaries may extend loans to one another 
in addition  in connection with the execution of the amendment  certain additional vishay subsidiaries  which have become significant subsidiaries as that term is defined under the credit agreement  have become parties to various security and guaranty documents 
effective august   we entered into a second amendment  which made certain additional technical changes to the collateral arrangements under the revolving credit agreement 
at december   we had committed and uncommitted short term credit lines with various us and foreign banks aggregating approximately million  of which approximately million was unused 
net purchases of property and equipment for the year ended december  were million  as compared to million in the prior year 
this increase is principally due to our planned expansion of capacity in the active business 
our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately million in  principally to expand capacity in the active business 
purchase of businesses  net of cash acquired  of million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively  represent cash payments for the acquisition of the assets of rfwaves and the acquisition of aeroflex pearl river  inc renamed vishay mic technology inc in  and payments made related to liabilities assumed from previous acquisitions in both periods 
for the next twelve months  management expects that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements  to meet our obligations under restructuring and acquisition integration programs  and to fund our research and development and capital expenditure plans 
acquisition activity may require additional borrowing under our revolving credit facilities or may require us to incur additional debt 
contractual commitments as of december  we had contractual obligations as follows in thousands total payments due by period less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases expected pension and postretirement plan funding estimated costs to complete construction in progress purchase commitments tantalum purchase commitments tower purchase commitments other total contractual cash obligations pursuant to the terms of the lyons due  the remaining holders of the lyons will have the right to put these notes to us on june   june   and june  at their accreted values on those dates  as set forth in the notes 
the aggregate purchase price for the june put date would be approximately million 
pursuant to the terms of the convertible subordinated notes due  the holders of these notes will have the right to put these notes to us on august   august   august  and august  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes million 
the commitments set forth in the table are based on the stated maturity dates and do not assume acceleration of payment pursuant to the respective options of the holders 
in  our subsidiary siliconix signed a long term manufacturing and supply agreement with tower semiconductor 
the technology transfer from siliconix to tower has started and is estimated to be completed by the second quarter of the commitments reflected above are based on the expected date of completion of the technology transfer in the second quarter of an acceleration or delay in the completion of the technology transfer will accelerate or delay  respectively  the timing of the future purchase commitments 
in  our subsidiary siliconix entered a five year foundry agreement for semiconductor manufacturing with a subcontractor in japan 
this agreement was a continuation and expansion of a previous technology transfer and business agreement for the manufacture of silicon wafers 
the agreement calls for siliconix to provide a rolling twelve month forecast of estimated requirements 
the first six months of this forecast are fixed as to quantity  and the subsequent six months are guaranteed not to be less than a quantity stated in the agreement 
thereafter  the monthly quantity may vary based on market demand 
under the agreement siliconix must guarantee that its business with this subcontractor represents a minimum percentage of wafer requirements and is required to make its best efforts not to reduce the average monthly demand rate below a specified threshold best efforts threshold 
the purchase commitments in the table above represent the minimum commitments for year one based on the fixed quantities for months one through six and the minimum average quantities for months seven through twelve  and the expected minimum commitment based on the best efforts threshold for the remainder of the agreement 
our actual purchases in future periods are expected to be greater than these minimum commitments 
generally accepted accounting principles require that management evaluate if purchase commitments are at prices in excess of current market price 
the purchase commitments for silicon wafers entered by siliconix are for the manufacture of proprietary products using siliconix owned technology licensed to these subcontractors by siliconix  and accordingly  management can only estimate the market price of the wafers which are the subject of these commitments 
management believes that these commitments are at prices which are not in excess of estimated current market prices 
for a further discussion of long term debt  pensions  operating leases  and purchase commitments  please see notes    and to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation normally  inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long term contracts 
consequently  we can adjust our selling prices  to the extent permitted by competition  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin 
the primary objectives of this interpretation are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and how to determine when and which business enterprise the primary beneficiary should consolidate the variable interest entity 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either i the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that the primary beneficiary  as well as all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity  make additional disclosures 
certain disclosure requirements of fin were effective for financial statements issued after january  in december  the fasb issued fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r to address certain fin implementation issues 
the adoption of fin and fin r did not have any effect on our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits sfas no 
r 
the revised standard retains the disclosure requirement contained in the original standard and requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows and net period cost of defined pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
we adopted the annual disclosure requirements required by sfas no 
r for our us pension and other postretirement plans in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  as permitted by sfas no 
r  certain disclosures regarding non us pension plans and estimated future benefit payments for both us and us pension and other postretirement benefit plans were delayed until this annual report on form k for the year ending december  on december   the president of the united states signed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
on may   the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
fsp no 
is effective for the first interim period beginning after june  and provides that an employer shall measure the accumulated plan benefit obligation apbo and net periodic postretirement benefit cost taking into account any subsidy received under the act 
management does not believe that the prescription drug benefits available under our retiree health care benefit plans would be considered actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
accordingly  our measures of apbo and net periodic postretirement benefit cost as of and for the year ended december  do not include any subsidies which might be received under the act 
in september  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share eitf 
the task force concluded that contingently convertible instruments in which conversion into common stock is based on meeting a market price contingency should be included in the computation of diluted earnings per share at issuance  rather than waiting until the specified share price is met 
eitf is effective for reporting periods ending after december  and is applied retroactively 
while we have contingently convertible debt  eitf has no impact on our computation of diluted earnings per share  because our contingently convertible debt has a conversion trigger which has been deemed to be non substantive and thus these convertible notes have always been considered in our computation of diluted earnings per share

the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  or liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
this statement amends apb no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of this statement are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   with earlier application permitted 
the provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued two fsp s that provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effect of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  which was signed into law in october the jobs act could affect how companies report their deferred income tax balances 
in fsp no 
 the fasb concluded that the tax relief special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing from the jobs act should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate reduction 
fsp no 
allows a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the jobs act on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings  provided that appropriate disclosures are made 
these disclosures required by fsp no 
are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
safe harbor statement from time to time  information provided by us  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on our behalf  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control  which may cause actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated 
set forth below are important factors that could cause our results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf factors relating to our business generally our business is cyclical and the recent decline in demand in the electronic component industry may resume and may become more pronounced 
from to  we and others in the electronic and semiconductor component industry experienced a decline in product demand on a global basis  resulting in order cancellations and deferrals  lower average selling prices  and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations 
this decline was primarily attributable to a slowing of growth in the personal computer and cellular telephone product markets 
we and others in the industry saw indications of improvements in the economy and the electronic and semiconductor component industry in the first half of  followed by a downtrend in the second half of the year 
while we are anticipating that there will be an improved business climate in  improvements in the economy and the electronic and semiconductor component industry may not materialize 
the slowdown may resume and may become more pronounced 
a slowdown in demand  as well as recessionary trends in the global economy  make it more difficult for us to predict our future sales and manage our operations  and could adversely impact our results of operations 
we have incurred and may continue to incur restructuring costs and associated asset write downs 
to remain competitive  particularly when business conditions are difficult  we attempt to reduce our cost structure through restructuring activities 
this includes acquisition related restructuring  where we attempt to streamline the operations of companies we acquire and achieve synergies between our acquisitions and our existing businesses 
it also includes restructuring our existing businesses  where we seek to eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions and move operations  where possible  to jurisdictions with lower labor costs 
we recorded restructuring and severance costs  plus related asset write downs  in each of    and and expect to incur such expenses during in the past we have grown through acquisitions but this may not continue 
our long term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future 
we also cannot assure you that acquisitions that we complete in the future will be successful 
if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses  our results of operations  enterprise value  market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected 
our debt levels have increased  which could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition 
our outstanding debt increased from approximately million at the end of to approximately million at the end of while our debt levels decreased in  the marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult for us to obtain financing in the future 
to remain successful  we must continue to innovate 
our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop  introduce and market new and innovative products  to modify existing products  to respond to technological change and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements 
there are numerous risks inherent in this process  including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands 
if this occurs  we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
protection of intellectual property often involves complex legal and factual issues 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we have applied  and will continue to apply  for patents covering our technologies and products  as we deem appropriate 
however  our applications may not result in issued patents 
also  our existing patents and any future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies  design around our patented technologies or may challenge or seek to invalidate our patents 
the electronic components industry  particularly the discrete semiconductor sector  is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing patent and other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others 
further  we have observed that in the current electronic components industry business environment  companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors 
we will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  and may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing 
although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement  or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms 
an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we have begun to invest in start ups but our investments may not prove successful 
we believe that investment in new technologies that are related to our core businesses is important to position us for the future 
accordingly  we have begun a program of investing in technology start up enterprises  in which we may acquire a controlling or non controlling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us 
an example is our recent acquisition of all of the assets of rfwaves  ltd 
there are numerous risks in investments of this nature including the limited operating history of such start up entities  their need for capital and their limited or absence of production experience  as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the market place 
their can be no assurance  therefore  that our investments in start up enterprises will prove successful 
future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity 
if we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash  the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt 
this acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria 
under our existing credit facility  we are required to obtain the lenders consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios 
we are also restricted from paying cash dividends on our capital stock 
we cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms when required 
if we were to undertake an acquisition for equity  the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock 
our results are sensitive to raw material availability  quality and cost 
many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials  the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are significant price increases for these raw materials 
for example  the prices for tantalum and palladium  two raw materials that we use in our capacitors  are subject to fluctuation 
for periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising  we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used 
for periods in which the prices are declining  we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials  since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost  this write down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
we recorded substantial write downs of tantalum and palladium in the economic downturn from to  and recorded more modest write downs in from time to time there have been short term market shortages of raw materials 
while these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing tantalum and palladium  they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us 
we cannot assure you that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production  particularly during periods of growing demand for our products 
our backlog is subject to customer cancellation 
as of december   our backlog was million 
many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty 
our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when backlog is particularly long 
they often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive  a situation that we have experienced during periods of economic slowdown 
therefore  we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog does not exceed the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered 
our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog 
we face intense competition in our business  and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers 
our business is highly competitive worldwide  with low transportation costs and few import barriers 
we compete principally on the basis of product quality and reliability  availability  customer service  technological innovation  timely delivery and price 
the electronics components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors  some of which are larger than us  have significant financial resources and technological capabilities 
our customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years  and as a result  their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing 
this trend has adversely affected our average selling prices  particularly for commodity components 
we may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products 
our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy  we may experience intense demand for our products 
during such periods  we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand 
factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment  shortages of skilled personnel and capacity constraints at our facilities 
if we are unable to meet our customers requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production  we could lose customers and or market share 
this loss could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase costs 
our manufacturing operations  products and or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances  wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes  employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes  products or packaging  restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging 
we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities which we believe are adequate 
nevertheless  we often unavoidably inherit certain pre existing environmental liabilities  generally based on successor liability doctrines 
although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations  there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
in addition  more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future  and we cannot presently determine the modifications  if any  in our operations that any such future regulations might require  or the cost of compliance with these regulations 
in order to resolve liabilities at various sites  we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees  some of which may be  under certain conditions  reopened or subject to renegotiations 
our products may experience a reduction in product classification levels under various military specifications 
we have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications  approved and monitored by the united states defense electronic supply center  and under certain european military specifications 
these products are assigned certain classification levels 
in order to maintain the classification level of a product  we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies 
if any of our products fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level  that product s classification may be reduced to a lower level 
a decrease in the classification level for any of our products with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net sales and earnings attributable to that product 
our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  managerial  marketing  finance and administrative personnel 
rapid changes in technologies  frequent new product introductions  and declining average selling prices over product life cycles require us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis 
our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal  tax  accounting  financial reporting  auditing  and treasury 
the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive 
while we have employment agreements with six of our executives  we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel 
management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  identified a material weakness regarding the adequacy of our finance organization 
the loss of the services of or the failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
factors relating to vishay s operations outside the united states we obtain substantial benefits by operating in israel  but these benefits may not continue 
we have increased our operations in israel over the past several years 
the low tax rates in israel applicable to earnings of our operations in that country  compared to the rates in the united states  have had the general effect of increasing our net earnings  although this was not the case during   and due to losses on purchase commitments 
also  we have benefited from employment incentive grants made by the israeli government 
in  the israeli government suspended payment on one of these grants after we were forced to lay off a significant number of employees as a result of the recent economic downturn 
although we reached agreement with the israeli government to resume payment on this grant  there can be no assurance that we will maintain our eligibility for this or other existing project grants 
there can also be no assurance in the future the israeli government will continue to offer new grant and tax incentive programs applicable to us or that  if it does  such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received or that we will continue to be eligible to take advantage of them 
any significant increase in the israeli tax rates or reduction or elimination of the israeli grant programs that have benefited us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we attempt to improve profitability by operating in countries in which labor costs are low  but the shift of operations to these regions may entail considerable expense 
our strategy is aimed at achieving significant production cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to and in countries with lower production costs  such as the czech republic  hungary  india  israel  malaysia  mexico  the people s republic of china  and the philippines 
in this process  we may experience under utilization of certain plants and factories in high labor cost regions and capacity constraints in plants and factories located in low labor cost regions 
this under utilization may result initially in production inefficiencies and higher costs 
these costs include those associated with compensation in connection with work force reductions and plant closings in the higher labor cost regions  and start up expenses  manufacturing and construction delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the initiation or expansion of production in lower labor cost regions 
in addition  as we implement transfers of certain of our operations we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay offs or termination of our employees in high labor cost countries 
we are subject to the risks of political  economic and military instability in countries outside the united states in which we operate 
we have operations outside the united states  and approximately of our revenues during were derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
some of the countries in which we operate have in the past experienced and may continue to experience political  economic and military instability or unrest 
these conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and  depending on the extent and severity of these conditions  could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition and operating results 
we have never experienced any material interruption in our israeli operations in our years of operations there  in spite of several middle east crises  including wars 
however  we might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the middle east that interfered with our operations in israel 
our business was affected by the outbreak of sars in and the effects of that outbreak may recur 
the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  that began in the people s republic of china adversely affected our business during the first six months of  particularly in asia where we derive approximately to of our revenue 
this impact included disruptions in the operations of our customers  a slowdown in customer orders and reduced sales in certain end markets 
if an outbreak of sars or a like disease were to recur on a comparable scale in asia or elsewhere  we could experience similar disruptions to our business 
general economic and business factors in addition to the factors relating specifically to our business  a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results  performance  or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements 
these factors include overall economic and business conditions  competitive factors in the industries in which we conduct our business  changes in governmental regulation  changes in tax requirements  including tax rate changes  new tax laws  and revised tax law interpretations  changes in generally accepted accounting principles or interpretations of those principles by governmental agencies and self regulatory groups  interest rate fluctuations  foreign currency rate fluctuations  and other capital market conditions  and economic and political conditions in international markets  including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders 
our common stock  traded on the new york stock exchange  has in the past experienced  and may continue to experience  significant fluctuations in price and volume 
we believe that the financial performance and activities of other publicly traded companies in the electronic component and semiconductor industries could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially without regard to our operating performance 
we operate in a continually changing business environment  and new factors emerge from time to time 
other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on our future results  performance  or achievements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed 
we are exposed to changes in us dollar libor interest rates on our floating rate revolving credit facility 
at december   there was million outstanding under this facility 
on a selective basis  we from time to time enter into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt 
the impact of interest rate instruments on our results of operations in each of the three years ended december    and was not significant 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for components of our long term debt and interest rate swap arrangements 
in august  we entered into six interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million to manage interest rate risk related to our multicurrency revolving line of credit 
as of december   five of these six agreements had been terminated 
the remaining agreement had a notional amount of million and required us to make payments to the counterparty at variable rates based on usd libor bba rates 
this agreement expired in during the year ended december   we had a pretax gain of approximately million related to the expiration of the final swap agreement 
during the year ended december   we recorded pretax losses of million relating to an ineffective hedge for a portion of time relating to an interest rate swap agreement 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks 
our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in germany  france  israel and asia 
in most locations  we have introduced a netting policy where subsidiaries pay all intercompany balances within thirty days 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risks associated with interest rate movements  currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities and collectibility of accounts receivable
