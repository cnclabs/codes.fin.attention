item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview introduction pep boys is a leader in the automotive aftermarket  with stores and more than  service bays located throughout states and puerto rico 
all of our stores feature the nationally recognized pep boys brand name  established through more than years of providing high quality automotive merchandise and services  and are company owned  ensuring chain wide consistency for our customers 
we are the only national chain offering automotive service  accessories  tires and parts under one roof  positioning us to achieve our goal of becoming the category dominant one stop shop for automotive maintenance and accessories 
of its stores  are what we call supercenters  which feature an average of state of the art service bays  with an average of more than  square feet per supercenter 
our store size allows us to display and sell a more complete offering of merchandise in a wider array of categories than our competitors  with a focus on the high growth accessories segment and a comprehensive tire offering 
we leverage this investment in inventory through our ability to install what we sell in our service bays and by offering this merchandise to both commercial and retail customers 
we had total revenues of  and operating profit of  in fiscal for the fifty two weeks ended january  our comparative sales increased by compared to and for the fifty two weeks ended january  and february   respectively 
this increase in comparable sales is due primarily to new product offerings 
during  we were able to reduce our total debt and increase our cash and cash equivalents by  and  respectively 
this was accomplished through several financing activities along with net cash provided by operating activities 
these financing activities consisted of a  common stock offering and a  senior subordinated note offering 
the proceeds of these financings were used to repay debt and applied to our store redesign plan described below 
since  we have paid a quarterly cash dividend on an uninterrupted basis  and we are currently paying an annual dividend of per share 
we continued to reinvest in our existing stores to completely redesign their interiors and enhance their exterior appeal 
our new interior design features four distinct merchandising worlds accessories fashion  electronic and performance merchandise  maintenance hard parts and chemicals  garage repair shop and travel and service including tire  wheel and accessory installation 
we believe that this layout provides customers with a clear and concise way of finding what they need and will promote cross selling 
in most of our stores  we will move our service desks and waiting areas inside the retail stores adjacent to our tire offering displays 
modifications to the exterior of our stores are designed to increase customer traffic 
on the first day of fiscal  the company separated its field organization into separate retail and service organizations 
the restructuring  which allows the company to hire management employees with industry specific experience in retail or service  is expected to sharpen the focus on each side of the business thereby improving overall profitability 
business strategy our strategy to become the category dominant one stop shop for automotive maintenance and accessories includes improving our merchandising capabilities 
we will continue to fill our stores with a new and flexible merchandising mix designed to increase customer traffic 
we will take advantage of our industry leading average retail square footage to improve and intensify its merchandise displays 
we utilize product specific advertising to highlight promotional items and pricing  primarily through weekly print advertising 
enhancing our stores 
we continue to reinvest in our existing stores to completely redesign our interiors and enhance their exterior appeal 
we believe that this layout will provide customers with a clear and concise way of finding what they need and will promote cross selling 
focusing our service offering and introducing name brand tires 
we continue to build upon the competitive advantage that our service offering provides over our parts only competitors by sharpening our focus on the most profitable maintenance services and introducing name brand tires 
by narrowing our service offering  we believe that we can improve our financial performance  both by eliminating less profitable heavy repair services and by better managing the skills of our staff 
in addition  the introduction of name brand tires is expected to attract more customers and to help establish those customer relationships earlier in the post warranty period of their car s life 
new store growth 
we expect new store growth to begin in fiscal this growth will focus primarily upon increasing penetration in our existing markets to further leverage our investments 
we are likely to grow our total number of service bays through a combination of acquisitions and building new stores 
the format of these new stores is likely to include both supercenters and a service only format that will utilize existing supercenters for most of their inventory needs 
the following discussion explains the material changes in our results of operations for the fifty two weeks ended january   january  and february  capital liquidity capital resources and needs the company s cash requirements arise principally from the capital expenditures related to existing stores  offices and warehouses and to purchase inventory 
the primary capital expenditures for fiscal were attributed to capital maintenance of the company s existing stores and offices  including store redesigns 
the company opened no new stores in fiscal or compared with two new stores in fiscal in fiscal  with proceeds from a  common stock offering and a  senior subordinated note offering offset  in part  by increased capital expenditures and an increase in merchandise inventories  the company decreased its debt by  and increased its cash and cash equivalents by  in fiscal  with an increase in capital expenditures and decrease in accounts payable offset  in part  by a decrease in merchandise inventories  the company decreased its debt by  and increased its cash and cash equivalents by  in fiscal  with a decrease in merchandise inventories coupled with decreased levels of capital expenditures and an increase in accounts payable  the company decreased its debt by  and increased its cash and cash equivalents by  the company has no plans to open any new stores in fiscal management estimates capital expenditures relating to existing stores  warehouses and offices and the acquisition of new store sites during fiscal will be between  and  the company anticipates that its net cash provided by operating activities  its existing line of credit the availability of which was increased by  and the remaining portion of the proceeds of its financings will exceed its principal cash requirements in fiscal in fiscal  merchandise inventories increased as the company continued initiatives begun in fiscal designed to improve the overall product mix of its stores 
the new products average a higher carrying cost per product  which caused an increase in merchandise inventories despite no change in the average number of stock keeping units per store approximately
