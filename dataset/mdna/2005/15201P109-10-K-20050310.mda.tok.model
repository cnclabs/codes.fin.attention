table of contents the company acquired a interest in a newly formed joint venture  centerstate home loans  llc  during for  the entity  located in orlando  florida  originates brokers single family home mortgages for a fee 
the company does not assume any interest rate risk  market risk or credit risk 
the entity commenced business on december  the investment is carried on the equity method 
the company s principal asset is its ownership of the banks 
accordingly  the company s results of operations are primarily dependent upon the results of operations of the banks 
the company conducts commercial banking business consisting of attracting deposits from the general public and applying those funds to the origination of commercial  consumer and real estate loans including commercial loans collateralized by real estate 
the company s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from interest earning assets ie loans and investments less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities ie customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned and paid on these balances 
net interest income is dependent upon the company s interest rate spread which is the difference between the average yield earned on its interest earning assets and the average rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows  and loan demand 
additionally  and to a lesser extent  the company s profitability is affected by such factors as the level of non interest income and expenses  the provision for credit losses  and the effective tax rate 
non interest income consists primarily of service fees on deposit accounts and related services  and to a lesser extent commission earned on brokering single family home loans  and commissions earned on the sale of mutual funds  annuities and other non traditional and non insured investments

critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluation of individual loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry concentrations  historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 

table of contents changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
a standardized loan grading system is utilized at each of the company s subsidiary banks 
the grading system is integral to the company s risk assessment function related to lending 
loan officers of each bank assign a loan grade to their newly originated loans in accordance with the standard loan grades 
throughout the lending relationship  the loan officer is responsible for periodic reviews  and if warranted he she will downgrade or upgrade a particular loan based on specific events and or analyses 
loans graded or higher are placed on a watch list each month end and reported to that particular bank s board of directors 
the company s loan review officer  who is independent of the lending function and is not an employee of any subsidiary bank  periodically reviews each banks loan portfolio and lending relationships 
he may disagree with a particular bank s grade on a particular loan and subsequently downgrade or upgrade such loan s based on his risk analysis 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that collateral dependent loans are generally measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
the company considers loans graded or higher to be impaired 
deferred tax assets management uses an estimate of future earnings to support the position that the benefit of the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and net income will be reduced 
deferred tax assets are described further in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

provision for loan losses the provision for loan loss losses increased  or to  during the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  management s policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings  and is decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries on prior loan charge offs 
therefore  the provision for loan losses income statement effect is a residual of management s determination of allowance for loan losses balance sheet approach 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers those levels maintained by conditions of individual borrowers  the historical loan loss experience  the general economic environment and the overall portfolio composition 
as these factors change  the level of loan loss provision changes

table of contents loans lending related income is the most important component of the company s net interest income and is a major contributor to profitability 
the loan portfolio is the largest component of earning assets  and it therefore generates the largest portion of revenues 
the absolute volume of loans and the volume of loans as a percentage of earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin as loans are expected to produce higher yields than securities and other earning assets 
average loans during the year ended december   were  or of average earning assets  as compared to  or of average earning assets  for the year ending december  total loans  net of unearned fees and cost  at december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or

the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries of prior period loan charge offs 
the loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 
the allowance consists of amounts established for specific loans and is also based on historical loan loss experience 
the specific reserve element is the result of a regular analysis of all loans and commitments based on credit rating classifications 
the historical loan loss element represents an assessment of potential credit problems and is determined using loan loss experience of each loan type 
management also weighs general economic conditions  the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans  credit record of its borrowers  the fair market value of underlying collateral and other factors 
the company is committed to the early recognition of problems and to maintaining a sufficient allowance

loans are placed on a non accrual status when they are past due days and management believes the borrower s financial condition  after giving consideration to economic conditions and collection efforts  is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest accruals cease and uncollected interest is reversed and charged against current income 
subsequent collections reduce the principal balance of the loan until the loan is returned to accrual status 
at december  non accrual loans totaled  this consisted of an aggregate  in real estate related loans loans   in a mobile home loan loan  and several vehicle  equipment and other miscellaneous loans aggregating  loans

while management believes it uses the best information available at the time to make a determination with respect to the allowance for loan losses  management recognizes that many factors can adversely impact various segments of its market  and subsequent adjustments in the allowance may be necessary if future economic indications or other factors differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determination or if regulatory policies change 
as such management continuously focuses its attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential problem loans  as they arise 
although the total allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses from all loans  management allocates the reserve among the general loan portfolio categories for informational and regulatory reporting purposes 
regulatory examiners may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based upon their judgment about the information available to them at the time of their examination

table of contents note payable during the quarter ended june   the company entered into an unsecured borrowing facility with a large regional bank 
the facility is a two year million line of credit with a floating interest rate of libor 
the facility was paid off during september using funds from the corporate debenture issued on september  described below 
corporate debenture the company formed centerstate banks of florida statutory trust i the trust for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
on september   the company issued a floating rate corporate debenture in the amount of million 
the trust used the proceeds from the issuance of a trust preferred security to acquire the corporate debenture of the company 
the trust preferred security essentially mirrors the corporate debenture  carrying a cumulative preferred dividend at a variable rate equal to the interest rate on the corporate debenture three month libor plus basis points 
the initial rate in effect at the time of issuance was and is subject to change quarterly 
the rate in effect during the quarter ended december  was 
the corporate debenture and the trust preferred security each have year lives 
the trust preferred security and the corporate debenture are callable by the company or the trust  at their respective option after five years  and sooner in specific events  subject to prior approval by the federal reserve board  if then required 
related loan origination costs of  were capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense over a five year period 
the company has treated the trust preferred security as tier capital up to the maximum amount allowed  and the remainder as tier capital for federal regulatory purposes 
during  the company used a portion of the million of capital received to pay down a million short term borrowing facility 
the company intends to use the remainder to capitalize the future growth of its subsidiary banks 
securities the company accounts for its investments at fair value and classifies them as available for sale 
unrealized holding gains and losses are included as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of the effect of deferred income taxes 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  the company considers whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to year end  and forecasted performance of the security 
if a security has a decline in fair value below its amortized cost that is other than temporary  then the security will be written down to its new cost basis by recording a loss in the statement of operations 
the company does not engage in trading activities as defined in statement of financial accounting standard number 
table of contents the company s available for sale portfolio totaled  at december  and  at december   or and  respectively  of total assets 
see the tables below for a summary of security type  maturity and average yield distributions 
the company uses its security portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity and a base from which to pledge assets for repurchase agreements and public deposits 
when the company s liquidity position exceeds expected loan demand  other investments are considered by management as a secondary earnings alternative 
typically  management remains short term under years in its decision to invest in certain securities 
as these investments mature  they will be used to meet cash needs or will be reinvested to maintain a desired liquidity position 
the company has designated all of its securities as available for sale to provide flexibility  in case an immediate need for liquidity arises 
management believes the composition of the portfolio offers it flexibility in managing its liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity  without adversely impacting its regulatory capital levels 
the available for sale portfolio is carried at fair market value and had a net unrealized loss of approximately  at december   compared to a net unrealized gain of approximately  at december  the company invests primarily in direct obligations of the united states  obligations guaranteed as to the principal and interest by the united states  mortgage backed securities and obligations of agencies of the united states 
in addition  the company enters into federal funds transactions with its principal correspondent banks  and acts as a net seller of such funds

this confidence is significantly dependent on the company s ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves 
liquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis 
management measures the liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis 
short term sources of funding and liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities  investment securities eligible for pledging to secure borrowings from dealers and customers pursuant to securities sold under repurchase agreements  loan repayments  loan sales  deposits and certain interest rate sensitive deposits  and borrowings under overnight federal fund lines available from correspondent banks 
management believes that it is reasonably likely these funding sources will be available in the future 
in addition to interest rate sensitive deposits  the primary demand for liquidity is anticipated fundings under credit commitments to customers 
the company does not use off balance sheet financing 
liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate based liabilities  as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs 
liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations cost effectively and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments  lease obligations  and unexpected deposit outflows 
in this process  the company focuses on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet the needs of the company 
however  the contractual commitment table below focuses only on future obligations 
in the table  all deposits with indeterminate maturities  such as demand deposits  checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts  are presented as having a maturity of one year or less 

table of contents december  in thousands of dollars total one year or less over one year and less than three years over three years and less than five years over five years contractual commitments deposit maturities securities sold under agreements to repurchase long term debt operating lease obligations total interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the rate sensitive position  or gap  is the difference in the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities  at a given time interval  including both floating rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
the measurement of the company s interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the principal techniques used in asset liability management 
management generally attempts to maintain a range  set by policy  between rate sensitive assets and liabilities by repricing periods 
each bank sets its own range  approved by its board of directors 
generally  the range is between and 
if the bank falls outside their pre approved range  it requires board action and board approval 
the asset mix of the balance sheet is evaluated continually in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  and appropriate funding sources and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the various funding sources 
the company s gap and liquidity positions are reviewed periodically by management to determine whether or not changes in policies and procedures are necessary to achieve financial goals

the estimated fair value of each instrument category is also shown in the table 
while these estimates of fair value are based on management s judgment of the most appropriate factors  there is no assurance that  if the company had to dispose of such instruments at december   the estimated fair values would necessarily have been achieved at that date  since market values may differ depending on various circumstances 
the estimated fair values at december   should not necessarily be considered to apply at subsequent dates
