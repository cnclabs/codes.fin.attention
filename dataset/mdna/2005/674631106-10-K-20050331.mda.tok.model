we were founded in and have conducted operations within the aforementioned categories since then 
during  we changed our corporate name to ocean bio chem  inc the parent company from our former name  star brite corporation 
our operations were conducted as a privately owned company through march  when we completed our initial public offering of common stock

inventories inventories are primarily composed of raw materials and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market 
prepaid advertising and promotion in any given year we introduce certain new products to our customers

depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight line method 
stock based compensation we follow the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to record compensation costs 
opinion no 
requires that compensation cost be based on the difference  if any  between the quoted market price of the stock and the price the employee must pay to acquire the stock depending on the terms of the award 
for the years ended december   and  we have not adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
to record such compensation costs 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable 
our five largest customers represented approximately  and of consolidated gross revenues for the years ended december   and  and and of consolidated accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
we have had a longstanding relationship with each of these entities and have always collected open receivable balances 
however  the loss of any of these customers could have an adverse impact on our operations 
concentration of cash at various times of the year and at december   we had a concentration of cash in one bank in excess of prevailing insurance offered through the federal deposit insurance corporation at such institution 
management does not consider the excess deposits to be a significant risk 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amount of cash approximates its fair value 
the fair value of long term debt is based on current rates at which we could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities  and the carrying amount approximates fair value 
income taxes we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns 
we haves adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the only temporary differences included therein are attributable to differing methods of reflecting depreciation for financial statement and income tax purposes 
trademarks  trade names and patents the star brite trade name and trademark were purchased in for  the cost of such intangible assets was amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of years through december  effective january  and pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we have determined that the carrying value of such intangible assets relating to its star brite brand does not require further amortization 
in addition  we own two patents that we believes are valuable in limited product lines  but not material to our success or competitiveness in general 
there are no capitalized costs of these two patents 
translation of canadian currency the accounts of our canadian subsidiary are translated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which requires that foreign currency assets and liabilities be translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
results of operations are translated using the average exchange rate prevailing throughout the period 
the effects of unrealized exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into us dollars are accumulated as the translation adjustment in shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions  if any  are included in net earnings of the period 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity are our operations and short term borrowings from a commercial bank pursuant to a revolving line of credit aggregating million 
such line matures may   bears interest at prime plus 
and is secured by our trade receivables and inventory 
we are required to maintain a minimum working capital of million and meet certain other financial covenants during the term of the agreement 
as of december   we were obligated under this arrangement in the amount of  in connection with the purchase and expansion of the alabama facility  we closed on industrial development bonds during the proceeds were utilized for both the repayment of certain advances used to purchase the alabama facility and to expand such facility for our future needs 
during july  we completed another million industrial development bond financing through the city of montgomery  alabama 
such transaction funded an approximate  square foot addition to the manufacturing facility as well as the remaining machinery and equipment additions required therein 
this project was substantially completed during in order to market its alabama industrial development bonds at favorable rates  we obtained a substitute irrevocable letter of credit for the issue and a new irrevocable letter of credit for the issue 
under such letters of credit agreements maturing on july   we are required to maintain a stipulated level of working capital  a designated maximum debt to tangible ratio  and a required debt service coverage ratio 
such letters of credit are secured by a first priority mortgage on the underlying alabama facility and equipment 
the bonds are marketed weekly at the prevailing rates for such tax exempt instruments 
during the year ended december  such bonds carried interest ranging between and annually 
interest and principal are payable quarterly 
we believe current operations are sufficient to meet these obligations 
we are involved in making sales in the canadian market and must deal with the currency fluctuations of the canadian currency 
we do not engage in currency hedging and deals with such currency risk as a pricing issue 
during the past few years  we have introduced various new products to our customers 
at times this has required us to carry greater amounts of overall inventory and has resulted in lower inventory turnover rates 
the effects of such inventory turnover have not been material to our overall operations 
we believe that all required capital to maintain such increases can continue to be provided by operations and current financing arrangements 
many of the raw materials that we use in the manufacturing process are commodities that are subject to fluctuating prices 
we react to long term increases by passing along all or a portion of such increases to our customers 
results of operations years ended december  and sales and earnings varied when comparing the year ended december  to principally due to the factors enumerated below 
gross sales increased to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  management attributes this increase in sales to gains made during the third quarter of the current year as well as increased sales promotions and the related increase in revenues during the fourth quarter of cost of goods sold increased to of net sales for the year ended december  compared to of net sales in the year ended december  this change resulted from various factors  some of which negatively impacted margins and others  which mitigated these factors 
specifically  petroleum product costs are higher than those experienced in prior years and currently represent a higher portion of our manufacturing expenses 
in addition  a price increase was passed along on certain of our products during the first and second quarters of in addition  margins were favorably impacted by spreading the fixed elements of overhead over an increased revenue base 
advertising and promotion expenses increased approximately  for the period when compared to expenses in the same time period in the previous year 
this increase resulted primarily from increased co op advertising associated with increased sales to certain customers and the timing of various advertising programs in selling and administrative expenses increased by approximately  or in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  such change was primarily due to increased personnel costs and other normal recurring increases in operating expenses 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased approximately  when compared to the same twelve month period of this change was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates and increased borrowings 
years ended december  and sales and earnings varied when comparing the year ended december  to principally due to the factors enumerated below 
net sales net sales decreased approximately  or comparing the year ended december  with the period 
this was primarily due to decreased sales of our marine anti freeze and certain automotive products 
the anti freeze decrease was attributed to commodity pricing of raw materials and related freight issues  and the automotive decrease resulted from initial customer reaction to our strategic decision to achieve higher margins on these products 
cost of goods sold gross margins improved and cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of net sales when comparing the years ended december  and the costs of goods sold percentages were and for the periods during and  respectively 
this change was primarily due to our on going initiatives towards improving operating margins including a general sales price increase  utilization of cash discounts offered by suppliers  and product pricing in response to current commodity costs 
advertising and promotion advertising expense decreased approximately  or when comparing to this was primarily due to planned decreases in media advertising expenditures and lower customer co op advertising 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  or when comparing to interest expense interest expense incurred during decreased by approximately  compared to the decrease was primarily due to prevailing interest rates 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations for the years ended december  total thereafter long term debt obligations      capital leases    operating leases    purchase obligations other total      item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not engage in derivative transactions 
we become exposed to foreign currency transactions as a result of our operations in canada and we do not hedge such exposure 
differences in the fair value of investment securities are not material  therefore  the related market risk is not significant 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest rate on our bonds 
the interest rates on our bonds adjusted weekly and ranged between and during the year ended december
