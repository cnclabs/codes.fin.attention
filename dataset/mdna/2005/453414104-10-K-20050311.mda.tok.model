the bank is a community oriented bank  which emphasizes customer service and convenience 
as part of this strategy  the bank offers products and services designed to meet the needs of its retail and commercial customers 
the company generally has sought to achieve long term financial strength and stability by increasing the amount and stability of its net interest income and non interest income combined with maintaining a high level of asset quality 
in pursuit of these goals  the company has adopted a business strategy of controlled growth  emphasizing commercial real estate and multi family residential loans  commercial business loans  mortgage warehouse lines of credit and retail and commercial deposit products  while maintaining asset quality and stable liquidity levels 
business strategy controlled growth 
in recent years  the company has sought to increase its assets and expand its operations through internal growth as well as through acquisitions 
on april   the company completed its acquisition of sib and the merger of sib s wholly owned subsidiary  si bank  with and into the bank 
sib had billion in total assets effective the close of business on april  si bank  a full service federally chartered savings bank  operated full service branch offices on staten island  three full service branch offices in brooklyn  and a total of full service branch offices in new jersey 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
in addition to the opportunity to enhance shareholder value  the acquisition presented the company with a number of strategic opportunities and benefits that will assist its growth as a leading community oriented financial institution 
the opportunities include expanding the company s asset generation capabilities through use of sib s strong core deposit funding base  increasing deposit market share in the company s core new york city metropolitan area market and strengthening its balance sheet 
the company completed its acquisition of broad  which had million in assets  effective the close of business on july  and its acquisition of statewide  which had million in assets  effective the close of business on january  the company also completed several other smaller whole bank and branch acquisitions in earlier periods

emphasis on commercial real estate  commercial business and multi family lending 
since  the company has focused on expanding its higher yielding loan portfolios as compared to single family mortgage loans  including portfolios of fixed and variable rate commercial real estate loans  commercial business loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit 
although the company deemphasized the origination of single family residential loans over the past few years  the company experienced a significant increase in its single family residential portfolio of approximately billion as a result of the sib acquisition 
given the concentration of multi family housing units in the new york city metropolitan area  as well as the company s commitment to remain a leader in the multi family loan market  the company continues to emphasize the origination both for portfolio and for sale of loans secured by first liens on multi family residential properties  which consist primarily of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings 
in addition to continuing to generate mortgage loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate  the company also commenced a strategy in the fourth quarter of to originate and sell multi family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to fannie mae while retaining servicing in order to further the company s ongoing strategic objective of increasing non interest income related to lending and servicing revenue 
during the year ended december   the company originated for sale billion and sold billion of multi family residential mortgage loans  of which million were from the company s portfolio 
see business lending activities loan originations  purchases  sales and servicing 
in addition  to further expand its variable rate loan portfolios  in november  the company purchased certain mortgage warehouse lines from the provident bank 
the acquisition increased the mortgage warehouse line of credit portfolio by approximately million in lines with million in outstanding advances at the time of acquisition 
at december   mortgage warehouse lines of credit totaled billion with million outstanding 
commercial real estate  commercial business  multi family residential loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit all generally have a higher inherent risk of loss than single family residential mortgage or cooperative apartment loans because repayment of the loans or lines often depends on the successful operation of a business or the underlying property 
accordingly  repayment of these loans is subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market and the local economy 
in addition  the company s commercial real estate and multi family residential loans have significantly larger average loan balances compared to its single family residential mortgage and cooperative apartment loans 
the company s commercial real estate  commercial business and mortgage warehouse lines of credit portfolios comprised in the aggregate billion  or of its total loan portfolio at december  compared to billion  or at december  these portfolios as a percent of total loans declined modestly in due to the increase in the size of the single family residential loan portfolio as a result of the sib acquisition 
maintain asset quality 
management believes that maintaining high asset quality is key to achieving and sustaining long term financial success 
accordingly  the company has sought to maintain a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk through its underwriting standards and by generally limiting its origination to loans secured by properties or collateral located in its market area 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets at december  amounted to and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans amounted to  while at december   the percentages were and  respectively 
non performing assets increased million or to million at december  compared to million at december  the company s non accrual loans increased million to million at december  with the increase being primarily related to commercial business loans and single family residential mortgage loans which were partially offset by a decrease in non accrual commercial real estate loans 
loans days or more past maturity which continued to make payments on a basis consistent with the original repayment schedule increased by million to million at december  stable source of liquidity 
the company purchases short to medium term investment securities and mortgage related securities combining what 
table of contents management believes to be appropriate liquidity  yield and credit quality in order to achieve a managed and a reasonably predictable source of liquidity to meet loan demand as well as a stable source of interest income 
these portfolios  which totaled in the aggregate billion at december  compared to billion at december   are comprised primarily of mortgage related securities totaling billion of which billion consists of cmos and billion of mortgage backed securities  million of corporate bonds  million of obligations of the us government and federal agencies and million of preferred securities 
in accordance with the company s policy  securities purchased by the company generally must be rated at least investment grade upon purchase 
emphasis on retail deposits and customer service 
the company  as a community based financial institution  is largely dependent upon its growth and retention of competitively priced core deposits consisting of all deposit accounts other than certificates of deposit to provide a stable source of funding 
the company has retained many loyal customers over the years through a combination of quality service  customer convenience  an experienced staff and a commitment to the communities which it serves 
complementing the increased emphasis on expanding commercial and consumer relationships  lower costing core deposits increased billion or  to billion at december   as compared to december  excluding the billion of core deposits acquired in the acquisition of sib  core deposits grew by million  or  during the year ended december  furthermore  core deposits increased to of total deposits at december  compared to of total deposits at december  this increase in core deposits reflects both the continued successful implementation of the company s business strategy of increasing core deposits  as well as the successful performance of the company s de novo branch program
