table of contents business developments  industry trends and competition business development and strategy 
we have become a leader in the global automotive parts industry by capitalizing on the strength of our products  technological capabilities and systems integration skills 
over the last decade  we have experienced sales growth in many of our product lines due to an increasing focus by both governments and consumers on safety and fuel efficiency 
we believe that this trend is continuing as evidenced by ongoing regulatory activities and escalating fuel costs  and will enable us to experience growth in the most recent generation of advanced safety and fuel efficient products  such as vehicle stability control systems vsc  curtain and side air bags  occupant sensing systems  electrically assisted power steering systems and tire pressure monitoring systems 
throughout our long history as a leading supplier to major oems  we have focused on products where we have a technological advantage 
we have extensive technical experience in a broad range of product lines and strong systems integration skills  which enable us to provide comprehensive  systems based solutions for our oem customers 
we have a broad and established global presence and sell to all major oems across the world s major vehicle producing regions 
we believe our diversified business limits our exposure to the risks of any one geographic economy  product line or major customer 
industry trends 
the following key trends have been affecting the automotive parts industry over the past several years 
the statements regarding industry outlook  trends  the future development of certain automotive systems and other non historical statements contained in this section are forward looking statements consumer and regulatory focus on safety 
consumers  and therefore oems  are increasingly focused on  and governments are increasingly requiring  improved safety in vehicles 
for example  on december   the alliance of automobile manufacturers and the insurance institute for highway safety announced a new voluntary industry safety commitment to meet new performance criteria designed to enhance occupant protection in front and side impact crashes 
the announcement indicated that the new performance criteria would encompass a wide range of occupant protection technologies and designs  including enhanced matching of vehicle front structural components and enhanced side impact protection through the use of features such as side air bags  air bag curtains and revised side impact structures 
by september   at least of all vehicles offered in the united states by participating manufacturers are expected to meet the front to side performance criteria  and by september  of the vehicles of participating manufacturers are expected to meet the criteria 
more recently  in september  the national highway safety traffic administration nhtsa released its latest proposal under the tread act that mandates the assembly onto vehicles of a direct tire pressure monitoring system  capable of detecting when one or more tires are significantly under inflated 
under the present proposal  of light vehicles are required to comply in the first year beginning september  with compliance by september in september  nhtsa also released preliminary results of a study on the effectiveness of electronic stability control that indicated a dramatic reduction in single vehicle crashes for vehicles equipped with these systems 
advances in technology by us and others have led to a number of innovations in our product portfolio  which will allow us to benefit from this trend 
such innovations include electronic vehicle stability control systems  tire pressure monitoring systems  occupant sensing systems  rollover sensing and curtain air bag systems 
globalization of suppliers 
to serve multiple markets more cost effectively  many oems are manufacturing global vehicle platforms  which typically are designed in one location but are produced and sold in many different geographic markets around the world 
having operations in the geographic markets in which oems produce global platforms enables suppliers to meet oems needs more economically and efficiently 
few suppliers have this global coverage  and it is a source of significant competitive advantage for those suppliers that do 

table of contents shift of engineering to suppliers 
increasingly  oems are focusing their efforts on consumer brand development and overall vehicle design  as opposed to the design of individual vehicle systems 
in order to simplify the vehicle design and assembly processes and reduce their costs  oems increasingly look to their suppliers to provide fully engineered  combinations of components in systems and modules rather than individual components 
systems and modules increase the importance of tier suppliers because they generally increase the tier suppliers percentage of vehicle content 
increased electronic content and electronics integration 
the electronic content of vehicles has been increasing and  we believe  will continue to increase in the future 
consumer and regulatory requirements in europe and the united states for improved automotive safety and environmental performance  as well as consumer demand for increased vehicle performance and functionality at lower cost largely drive the increase in electronic content 
electronics integration  which generally refers to replacing mechanical with electronic components and integration of mechanical and electrical functions within the vehicle  allows oems to achieve a reduction in the weight of vehicles and the number of mechanical parts  resulting in easier assembly  enhanced fuel economy  improved emissions control  increased safety and better vehicle performance 
as consumers seek more competitively priced ride and handling performance  safety  security and convenience options in vehicles  such as electronic stability control  active cruise control  air bags  keyless entry and tire pressure monitoring  we believe that electronic content per vehicle will continue to increase 
increased emphasis on speed to market 
as oems are under increasing pressure to adjust to changing consumer preferences and to incorporate technological advances  they are shortening product development times 
shorter product development times also generally reduce product development costs 
we believe suppliers that are able to deliver new products to oems in a timely fashion to accommodate the oems needs will be well positioned to succeed in this evolving marketplace 
escalating pricing pressures on automotive suppliers 
pricing pressure from customers has been a characteristic of the automotive supply industry in recent years 
this pressure has been substantial and is likely to continue 
virtually all oems have policies of seeking price reductions each year 
suppliers have been forced to reduce prices in both the initial bidding process and during the terms of contractual arrangements 
we have taken steps to reduce costs and resist price reductions  however  price reductions have impacted our sales and profit margins and are expected to do so in the future 
inflationary pressures and supply base 
the automotive supply industry has recently experienced significant inflationary pressures  primarily in the ferrous metals and resin yarn markets 
these inflationary pressures placed significant operational and financial burdens on suppliers  and are expected to continue in we continuously work with our raw material and purchased component suppliers  as well as our customers  to mitigate the impact of increasing costs of ferrous metals and other commodities 
however  it is generally difficult to pass increased prices for manufactured components and raw materials through to our customers in the form of price increases 
the inflationary environment surrounding ferrous metals and certain other commodities has resulted in concern about the viability of the tier and tier supply base as they face these inflationary pressures 
because we purchase various types of equipment  raw materials and component parts from suppliers  we may be materially and adversely affected by the failure of those suppliers to perform as expected 
this non performance may consist of delivery delays or failures caused by production issues or delivery of non conforming products 
the risk of non performance may also result from the insolvency or bankruptcy of one or more of our suppliers 
we have seen the number of these bankruptcies or insolvencies increase  due in part to the recent inflationary pressures in the ferrous metals markets 
consequently  our efforts to continue to mitigate the effects of this inflationary pressure may be insufficient and the pressures may worsen  thus potentially having a negative impact on our financial results 
declining big three market share 
in recent years  the big three ford motor company  general motors corporation and the chrysler unit of daimlerchrysler ag have seen a decline in their market share for vehicle sales in north america and europe  with asian oems especially increasing their 
table of contents share in such markets 
although we do have business with the asian oems  our customer base is more heavily weighted towards the big three 
we believe that suppliers currently serving asian oems and those suppliers that are able to increase their sales with such customers will be well positioned in the north american and european markets 
recalls 
based on tighter federal requirements for reporting defects  as well as the growing re use of parts across platforms  oems have experienced increasing recall campaigns in recent years  including a record number of such recalls in oems often require suppliers to share in the cost of recalls 
suppliers able to minimize recall expenses through the delivery of high quality products should be well positioned in the marketplace 
therefore  we utilize six sigma and operational excellence as leading quality improvement programs throughout our operations 
competition the automotive parts industry is extremely competitive 
oems rigorously evaluate us and other suppliers based on many criteria such as quality  price cost competitiveness  system and product performance  reliability and timeliness of delivery  new product and technology development capability  excellence and flexibility in operations  degree of global and local presence  effectiveness of customer service and overall management capability 
we believe we compete effectively with leading automotive suppliers on all of these criteria 
for example  we generally follow manufacturing practices designed to improve efficiency  including but not limited to  one piece flow machining and assembly  and just in time scheduling of our manufacturing plants  all of which enable us to manage inventory so that we can deliver components and systems to our customers in the quantities and at the times ordered 
our resulting delivery performance  as measured by our customers  generally meets or exceeds our customers expectations 
within each of our product segments  we face significant competition 
our principal competitors include delphi  bosch  continental teves  visteon  koyo seiko  zf  and advics in the chassis systems segment  autoliv  delphi  takata  key safety  and bosch in the occupant safety systems segment  and itw  raymond  nifco  textron  kostal  delphi  valeo  tokai rika and eaton in the automotive components segment

table of contents chassis systems 
our chassis systems segment focuses on the design  manufacture and sale of product lines relating to steering  foundation brakes  brake control  modules and suspension 
we sell our chassis systems products primarily to oems and other tier suppliers 
we also sell these products to oem service organizations and in the independent aftermarket  through a licensee in north america  and in the rest of the world  to independent distributors 
we believe our chassis systems segment is well positioned to capitalize on growth trends towards increasing active safety systems  particularly in the areas of electric steering  electronic vehicle stability control and other advanced braking systems and integrated vehicle control systems 
occupant safety systems 
our occupant safety systems segment focuses on the design  manufacture and sale of air bags  seat belts  safety electronics  steering wheels and security electronic systems 
we sell our occupant safety systems products primarily to oems and also to other tier suppliers 
we also sell these products to oem service organizations for service parts 
we believe our occupant safety systems segment is well positioned to capitalize on growth trends toward increasing passive safety systems  particularly in the areas of side and curtain air bag systems  occupant sensing systems  active seat belt pretensioning and retractor systems  and tire pressure monitoring systems 
automotive components 
our automotive components segment focuses on the design  manufacture and sale of body controls  engine valves and engineered fasteners and components 
we sell our automotive components products primarily to oems and also to other tier suppliers 
we also sell these products to oem service organizations 
in addition  we sell some engine valve and body control products to independent distributors for the automotive aftermarket 
we believe our automotive components segment is well positioned to capitalize on growth trends toward multi valve engines and increasing electronic content per vehicle 
customers we sell to all the major oem customers across the world s entire major vehicle producing regions 
our long standing relationships with our customers have enabled us to understand global customers needs and business opportunities 
we believe that we will continue to be able to compete effectively for our customers business because of the high quality of our products  our ongoing cost reduction efforts  our strong global presence and our product and technology innovations 
although business with any given customer is typically split among numerous contracts  the loss of or a significant reduction in purchases by  one or more of those major customers could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition

customer support our engineering  sales and production facilities are located in countries 
with hundreds of dedicated sales customer development employees  we provide effective customer solutions  products and service in any region in which these facilities operate or manufacture 
joint ventures joint ventures represent an important part of our business  both operationally and strategically 
we have often used joint ventures to enter into new geographic markets such as china and india  or to acquire new customers or to develop new technologies such as direct tire pressure monitoring systems 
in the case of entering new geographic markets  where we have not previously established substantial local experience and infrastructure  teaming with a local partner can reduce capital investment by leveraging pre existing infrastructure 
in addition  local partners in these markets can provide knowledge and insight into local customs and practices and access to local suppliers of raw materials and components 
all of these advantages can reduce the risk  and thereby enhance the prospects for the success  of an entry into a new geographic market 
joint ventures can also be an effective means to acquire new customers 
joint venture arrangements can allow partners access to technology they would otherwise have to develop independently  thereby reducing the time and cost of development 
more importantly  they can provide the opportunity to create synergies and applications of the technology that would not otherwise be possible

table of contents intellectual property we own significant intellectual property  including a large number of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets  and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements 
although our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve  no single patent  copyright  trade secret or license  or group of related patents  copyrights  trade secrets or licenses  is  in our opinion  of such value to us that our business would be materially affected by the expiration or termination thereof 
however  we view the name trw automotive and primary mark trw which has been transferred to us as part of the acquisition as material to our business as a whole 
our general policy is to apply for patents on an ongoing basis in the united states  germany and appropriate other countries to protect our patentable developments 
our patent portfolio of over  patents and pending patent applications reflects our commitment to invest in technology and covers many aspects of our products and the processes for making those products 
in addition  we have developed a substantial body of manufacturing know how that we believe provides a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace 
we have entered into several hundred technology license agreements that either strategically exploit our intellectual property rights or provide a conduit for us into third party intellectual property rights useful in our businesses 
in many of these agreements  we license technology to our suppliers  joint venture companies and other local manufacturers in support of product production for our customers and us 
in other agreements  we license the technology to other companies to obtain royalty income 
we own a number of secondary trade names and marks applicable to certain of our businesses and products that we view as important to such businesses and products as well 
as part of the acquisition  we have entered into intellectual property license agreements with old trw 
seasonality our business is moderately seasonal because our largest north american customers typically halt operations for approximately two weeks in july and one week in december 
additionally  customers in europe historically shut down vehicle production during portions of august and one week in december 
in addition  third quarter automotive production traditionally is lower as new models are introduced 
accordingly  our third and fourth quarter results may reflect these trends 
research  development and engineering we operate a global network of technical centers worldwide where we employ approximately  engineers  researchers  designers  technicians and their supporting functions 
this global network allows us to develop automotive active and passive technologies while improving existing products and systems 
we utilize sophisticated testing and computer simulation equipment  including computer aided engineering  noise vibration harshness  crash sled  math modeling and vehicle simulations 
we have advanced engineering and research and development programs for next generation components and systems in our chassis  occupant safety and automotive component product areas 
we are disciplined in our approach to research and development  employing various tools to improve efficiency and reduce cost  such as six sigma  follow the sun  a hour a day engineering program that utilizes our global network  and other e engineering programs  and outsourcing non core activities

the principal components and raw materials we purchase include castings  electronic parts  molded plastic parts  finished subcomponents  fabricated metal  aluminum  steel  resins  textiles  leather and wood 
all of these components and raw materials are available from numerous sources 
we have recently seen significant inflationary pressures in the ferrous metals and resin yarn markets 
at this time  we are working with our suppliers and customers to attempt to mitigate the impact that this inflation may have on our financial results  but there can be no assurance that this will not have a material adverse effect 
we have not  in recent years  experienced any significant shortages of manufactured components or raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of these items in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedule 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees including employees of our majority owned joint ventures but excluding temporary employees and employees who are on approved forms of leave  of whom approximately  were employed in north america  approximately  were employed in europe  approximately  were employed in south america and approximately  were employed in asia 
approximately  of our employees are salaried and approximately  are hourly 
environmental matters governmental requirements relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have had  and will continue to have  an effect on our operations and us 
we have made and continue to make expenditures for projects relating to the environment  including pollution control devices for new and existing facilities 
we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations to comply with applicable requirements and  along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste management sites 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 
a reserve estimate for each matter is established using standard engineering cost estimating techniques on an undiscounted basis 
in the determination of such costs  consideration is given to the professional judgment of our environmental engineers  in consultation with outside environmental specialists  when necessary 
at multi party sites  the reserve estimate also reflects the expected allocation of total project costs among the various potentially responsible parties 
as of december   we had reserves for environmental matters of million 
in addition  the company has established a receivable from northrop for a portion of this environmental liability as a result of the indemnification provided for in the master purchase agreement under which northrop has agreed to indemnify us for of any environmental liabilities associated with the operation or ownership of old trw s automotive business existing at or prior to the 
table of contents acquisition  subject to certain exceptions 
during  we received approximately million under such indemnification from northrop 
we do not believe that compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
our capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during and are not expected to be material to us 
we believe that any liability that may result from the resolution of environmental matters for which sufficient information is available to support cost estimates will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our financial position of expenditures for aspects of certain matters for which there is insufficient information 
in addition  we cannot predict the effect of compliance with environmental laws and regulations with respect to unknown environmental matters on our financial position or results of operations or the possible effect of compliance with environmental requirements imposed in the future

item legal proceedings various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings are pending or threatened against us or our subsidiaries  covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities with respect to commercial  patent  product liability and environmental matters 
in october  kelsey hayes company formerly known as fruehauf corporation was served with a grand jury subpoena relating to a criminal investigation being conducted by the us attorney for the southern district of illinois 
the us attorney has informed us that the investigation relates to possible wrongdoing by kelsey hayes company and others involving certain loans made by kelsey hayes company s then parent corporation to fruehauf trailer corporation  the handling of the trailing liabilities of fruehauf corporation and actions in connection with the bankruptcy of fruehauf trailer corporation 
kelsey hayes company became a wholly owned subsidiary of old trw upon old trw s acquisition of lucas varity in and became our wholly owned subsidiary in connection with the acquisition

on may   arvinmeritor inc filed suit against old trw in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan  claiming breach of contract and breach of warranty in connection with certain tie rod ends that old trw supplied to arvinmeritor and the voluntary recall of some of these tie rod ends 
arvinmeritor subsequently recalled all of the tie rod ends  claiming that it was entitled to reimbursement from old trw for the costs associated with both the products recalled by old trw and those recalled by arvinmeritor on its own 
on december   the parties reached an agreement to settle this dispute with no material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
while certain of our subsidiaries have been subject in recent years to asbestos related claims  we believe that such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in general  these claims seek damages for illnesses alleged to have resulted from exposure to asbestos used in certain components sold by our subsidiaries 
we believe that the majority of the claimants were assembly workers at the major us automobile manufacturers 
the vast majority of these claims name as defendants numerous manufacturers and suppliers of a wide variety of products allegedly containing asbestos 
we believe that  to the extent any of the products sold by our subsidiaries and at issue in these cases contained asbestos  the asbestos was encapsulated 
based upon several years of experience with such claims  we believe that only a small proportion of the claimants has or will ever develop any asbestos related impairment 
neither our settlement costs in connection with asbestos claims nor our average annual legal fees to defend these claims have been material in the past 
these claims are strongly disputed by us and it has been our policy to defend against them aggressively 
we have been successful in obtaining the dismissal of many 
table of contents cases without any payment whatsoever 
moreover  there is significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers with respect to these claims 
however  while our costs to defend and settle these claims in the past have not been material  we cannot assure you that this will remain so in the future 
we believe that the ultimate resolution of the foregoing matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations

we achieved strong results  with net sales of approximately billion  up million or approximately from the increase resulted primarily from a higher level of sales from new product areas and foreign currency translation  partially offset by pricing provided to customers and a reduction in sales due to a first quarter divestiture 
operating income for was million  an increase of million compared to the prior year operating income 
the increase in operating income resulted from the absence in the current year of acquisition related write offs of in process research and development of million and fair value adjustments to inventory of million 
this increase also resulted from an increased level of sales and a higher level of cost savings  partially offset by pricing provided to customers and inflation primarily in the area of ferrous metals and other commodities among other matters 
net earnings for were million compared with net losses of million in results for included losses on retirement of debt of million incurred in conjunction with various debt refinancing transactions  compared to million in recent trends 
we achieved our results despite certain unfavorable trends including a decline in market share for vehicle sales among some of our largest customers  pricing pressure from oems  the continued rise in inflationary pressures impacting ferrous metals and most recently other commodities and the growing concerns over the economic viability of our tier and tier supply base as they face inflationary pressures 
during  the effect of these unfavorable trends was mitigated by favorable trends including our 
table of contents sales growth  foreign currency translation and a high level of cost reductions in our businesses 
while we continue our efforts to mitigate the risk described above  we cannot assure you that the favorable trends that occurred in will continue in the future or that we will not experience a decline in sales  increased costs or disruptions in supply  or that these items will not adversely impact our future earnings 
in recent years  the big three ford motor company  general motors corporation and the chrysler unit of daimlerchrysler ag have seen a decline in their market share for vehicle sales in north america and europe  with asian oems especially increasing their share in such markets 
although we do have business with the asian oems  our customer base is more heavily weighted towards the big three 
additionally  pricing pressure from the big three and other customers is characteristic of the automotive parts industry 
this pressure is substantial and continuing 
virtually all oems have policies of seeking price reductions each year 
consequently  we have been forced to reduce our prices in both the initial bidding process and during the terms of contractual arrangements 
we have taken steps to reduce costs and resist price reductions  however  price reductions have impacted our sales and profit margins and are expected to do so in the future 
we continue to work with our suppliers and customers to mitigate the impact of increasing costs of ferrous metals and other commodities 
however  it is generally difficult to pass increased prices for manufactured components and raw materials through to our customers in the form of price increases 
these inflationary pressures have placed a significant operational and financial burden on the company this year and are expected to continue into furthermore  because we purchase various types of equipment  raw materials and component parts from our suppliers  we may be adversely affected by their failure to perform as expected as a result of being unable to adequately mitigate these inflationary pressures 
these pressures have proven to be insurmountable to some of our suppliers and we have seen the number of bankruptcies or insolvencies increase due in part to the recent inflationary pressures 
while this has not led to any significant issues thus far  it could lead to delivery delays  production issues or delivery of non conforming products by our suppliers in the future 
as such  we continue to monitor our supply base for the best source of supply 
our debt and capital structure 
on an ongoing basis we monitor  and may modify  our debt and capital structure to reduce associated costs and provide greater financial flexibility 
during  we continued to reduce our debt levels in addition to amending and restating our credit agreements 
on november   the company amended and restated its then existing credit agreement to provide for a new million tranche e term loan  the proceeds of which were used  along with available cash to repurchase its subsidiary s acquisition related pay in kind seller note seller note with a face value  including accrued interest  of million  from a subsidiary of northrop 
in conjunction with the repurchase of the seller note on november   the company recorded a pre tax charge of million for loss on retirement of debt resulting from the difference between the purchase price ascribed to the seller note and the book value of the seller note on the company s balance sheet on the repurchase date 
on december   the company amended and restated its existing credit agreement to  among other things  provide for billion in senior secured credit facilities  consisting of i a year million revolving credit facility  ii a year million term loan a facility and iii a year million term loan b facility 
the initial draw under the new senior secured facilities occurred on january  as provided for under the amendment 
proceeds from the new senior secured facilities were used to refinance the senior secured credit facilities existing as of december  with the exception of the term e loan discussed below  and pay fees and expenses related to the refinancing 
in december  the company recorded a loss on retirement of debt of million related to the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the previously existing revolving facility and certain of the prior syndicated term loans 
additionally  the company recognized accelerated amortization expense of million on debt issuance costs related to certain of the syndicated term loans not extinguished until the funding date 
in  the company will recognize additional accelerated amortization expense of million on the remaining debt issuance costs related to those certain syndicated term loans not extinguished until the funding date 
changes in our debt and capital structure  among other items  may impact our effective tax rate 
our overall effective tax rate is equal to consolidated tax expense as a percentage of consolidated earnings before tax 
however  tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional basis 

table of contents we are in a position whereby losses incurred in certain tax jurisdictions provide no current financial statement benefit 
in addition  certain jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the united states statutory rate 
as such  changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate in future periods 
changes in tax law and rates could also have a significant impact on the effective rate in future periods 
automotive environment our business is greatly affected by the automotive build rates  primarily in north america and europe 
the automobile industry is characterized by short term volatility  but long term growth of  light vehicle sales and production 
new vehicle demand is driven by macro economic and other factors such as interest rates  manufacturer and dealer sales incentives  fuel prices  consumer confidence and employment and income growth trends 
these factors ultimately determine longer term vehicle production and sales rates 
one of the current trends in the automotive industry is for oems to shift research and development  design and testing responsibility to suppliers 
we operate in a difficult pricing environment and our goal is to mitigate the pricing pressure imposed by oems by continuing cost reduction efforts and restructuring our business 
we also have recently seen significant inflationary pressures in the ferrous metals markets  which has extended into other commodities 
we are fully engaged in supply chain management and utilizing six sigma and operational excellence as leading quality improvement programs throughout our operations and functions 
restructuring in  the company recorded charges of million for actions that resulted in the closing of two plants and employee reductions of approximately for the year ended december   the cash charges were million for severance and costs related to the consolidation of certain facilities and the non cash charges were million 
for the ten months ended december   we recorded cash charges of million for severance and costs related to the consolidation of certain facilities 
additionally  we recorded a million reserve through purchase accounting primarily for severance related to strategic restructurings  plant closings and involuntary employee termination arrangements outside of the united states to be paid over the next several years in accordance with local laws 
in connection with the acquisition  we assumed liabilities subject to certain exceptions totaling approximately million for various restructuring activities  primarily related to involuntary severance obligations and costs to exit certain activities 
during the two months ended february   the predecessor recorded cash charges of million for severance and costs related to the consolidation of certain facilities 
in  the predecessor recorded charges of million for actions that resulted in the closing of three plants and employee reductions of approximately for the year ended december   the cash charges were million  and the non cash charges were million

critical accounting estimates the critical accounting estimates that affect our financial statements and that use judgments and assumptions are listed below 
in addition  the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under varied conditions and assumptions is noted 
product recalls 
we are at risk for product recall costs 
recall costs are costs incurred when the customer or we decide to recall a product through a formal campaign  soliciting the return of specific products due to a known or suspected safety concern 
in addition  the nhtsa has the authority  under certain circumstances  to require recalls to remedy safety concerns 
product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced  customer cost of the recall and labor to remove and replace the defective part 
during the predecessor periods  when a decision to recall a product had been made for which we bore some responsibility  we recorded the estimated cost to us of the recall as a charge to net earnings in that period  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
in making estimates relating to product recalls  judgment was required as to the number of units to be returned  the total cost of the recall campaign  the ultimate negotiated sharing of the cost between us and the customer and  in some cases  the extent to which our supplier would share in the recall cost 
as a result  our actual recall costs could be significantly different from our estimated costs 
effective as of the acquisition date  we implemented a new methodology for actuarially estimating our recall obligations that differs from that of the predecessor 
we engage independent third party actuaries to run loss histories for the purpose of establishing loss projections 
under the actuarial estimation methodology  we accrue for recalls when revenues are recognized upon shipment of product 
using an actuarial based estimation will have the effect of better matching revenues and expenses as relative to the methodology employed by the predecessor 
compared with the predecessor  we will record higher expenses in a period of minor or no recalls and lower expenses in a period of significant recall since the obligation will have already been accrued as the revenue was recognized 
however  due to uncertainties related to the nature of recall claims  if future claims exceed actuarial projections which are based on historical performance  there could be a material effect on the accrual for recalls in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles 
we evaluate long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying value 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are written down to their fair value 
we also evaluate the useful lives of intangible assets each reporting period 
the determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are based on industry specific data 
we use external vehicle build assumptions published by widely used external sources and market share data by customer based on known and targeted awards over a five year period 
the projected profit margin assumptions included in the plans are based on the current cost structure and anticipated cost reductions 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and additional impairment of assets might be required to be recorded 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the estimated fair values to the carrying values 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on cash flows  discussed above  discounted at a risk adjusted rate of return 
we are subject to financial statement risk in the event that intangible assets become impaired 

table of contents goodwill 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in connection with the acquisition  we have applied the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired  was approximately  million as of december   or of our total assets 
in accordance with sfas  we perform annual impairment testing at a reporting unit level 
to test goodwill for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the estimated fair value to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  then a possible impairment of goodwill exists and requires further evaluation 
estimated fair values are based on the cash flows projected in the reporting units strategic plans and long range planning forecasts see impairment of long lived assets and intangibles  discounted at a risk adjusted rate of return 
as the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values at each testing date since adoption  we have recorded no goodwill impairment 
while we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable based upon current information and assumptions about future results  changes in our businesses  the markets for our products  the economic environment and numerous other factors could significantly alter our fair value estimates and result in future impairment of recorded goodwill 
we are subject to financial statement risk in the event that goodwill becomes impaired 
pensions 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
this determination involves the selection of an expected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate 
the weighted average assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations as of the end of the year  and the net periodic benefit cost for the following year are as follows rest of rest of us us world us us world discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels the weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december  and for the ten month period ended december  are shown in the following table year ended ten months ended december  december  rest of rest of us us world us us world discount rate expected long term return on plan assets rate of increase in compensation levels based on our assumptions as of october   as discussed below  a change in these assumptions  holding all other assumptions constant  would have the following effect on our pension costs and obligations on an annual basis impact on net periodic benefit cost increase decrease us us all other us us all other dollars in millions 
change in discount rate 
change in expected long term rate of return 
table of contents impact on obligations increase decrease us us all other us us all other dollars in millions 
change in discount rate sfas and the policies we have used  most notably the use of a calculated value of plan assets for pensions as further described below  generally reduce the volatility of pension income and expense that would otherwise result from changes in the value of the pension plan assets and pension liability discount rates 
a substantial portion of our pension benefits relate to our plans in the united states and the united kingdom 
for the year ended december   and the ten months ended december   our net pension expense reflects a combination of a decreased long term rate of return assumption on the assets  decreased discount rate and use of fair value of plan assets as of march  in our purchase accounting  as opposed to the five year market related value used historically 
the predecessor s results of operations for the periods presented through february  reflect net pension income due to the over funded status of our uk plan  net of pension expense for our uk and other plans 
a key assumption in determining our net pension income expense in accordance with sfas is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we review our long term rate of return assumptions annually through comparison of our historical actual rates of return with our expectations  and consultation with our actuaries and investment advisors regarding their expectations for future returns 
while we believe our assumptions of future returns are reasonable and appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future pension income expense 
the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense is determined by applying the expected long term rate of return on assets to a calculated market related value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
in computing the expected return on plan assets that was included in the pension expense of the successor for the ten month period ended december  and for the year ended december   the market related value of assets was reset at march  to equal the fair value of assets  in subsequent years  asset gains and losses will be amortized over five years in determining the market related value of assets used to calculate the expected return component of pension income 
the predecessor used this same methodology to calculate the expected return 
another key assumption in determining our net pension income expense is the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency  and that have cash flows similar to those of the underlying benefit obligation 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension income expense  and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  are recognized in expense on a deferred basis as allowed by sfas as a result of the acquisition and the application of purchase accounting  all unamortized effects of historical changes were immediately recognized in the opening balance sheet 
our pension expense income is estimated to be approximately million in the us  million in the us and million for the rest of the world based on december  exchange rates 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our us pension plans and approximately million to our non us pension plans in 
table of contents other post retirement benefits 
we account for our other post retirement benefits opeb in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
this determination requires the selection of a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations 
the following are the significant assumptions used in the measurement of the accumulated projected benefit obligations apbo as of the october measurement date us canada us canada discount rate initial health care cost trend rate at end of year ultimate health care cost trend rate year in which ultimate rate is reached the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the opeb liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency and that have cash flows similar to those of the underlying benefit obligation 
we develop our estimate of the health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations through review of our recent health care cost trend experience and through discussions with our actuary regarding the experience of similar companies 
changes in the assumed discount rate or health care cost trend rate can have a significant impact on our actuarially determined liability and related opeb expense 
a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects one percentage point increase decrease dollars in millions effect on total of service and interest cost components for the year ended december  effect on post retirement benefit obligations as of october  our opeb expense is estimated to be approximately million 
we fund our opeb obligation on a pay as you go basis 
we expect to contribute approximately million on a pay as you go basis in valuation allowances on deferred income tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers historical losses  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we determined that we could not conclude that it was more likely than not that the benefits of certain deferred income tax assets would be realized 
the valuation allowance we recorded reduced to zero the net carrying value of all united states and certain foreign net deferred tax assets 
we expect the deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance  to be realized as a result of the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences in the united states and as a result of projected future taxable income and the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences in certain foreign jurisdictions 
environmental 
governmental regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have had  and will continue to have  an effect on our operations 
we have made and continue to make expenditures for projects relating to the environment  including pollution control devices for new and existing facilities 
we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations to comply with applicable requirements and along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste management sites 

table of contents a reserve estimate for each matter is established using standard engineering cost estimating techniques on an undiscounted basis 
in the determination of such costs  consideration is given to the professional judgment of our environmental engineers  in consultation with outside environmental specialists  when necessary 
at multi party sites  the reserve estimate also reflects the expected allocation of total project costs among the various potentially responsible parties 
each of the environmental matters is subject to various uncertainties  and some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 
we believe that any liability  in excess of amounts accrued in our consolidated and combined financial statements  that may result from the resolution of these matters for which sufficient information is available to support cost estimates  will not have a material adverse affect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for aspects of certain matters for which there is insufficient information 
in addition  we cannot predict the effect of compliance with environmental laws and regulations with respect to unknown environmental matters 
results of operations the following consolidated and combined statements of operations compare the results of operations for the years ended december   and due to the change in ownership  and the resultant application of purchase accounting  our predecessor s pre acquisition financial statements and our post acquisition financial statements have been prepared on different bases of accounting that do not straddle the acquisition date  and therefore are not comparable

ebitda for the year ended december  was  million compared to million for the year ended december  ebitda  a measure used by management to measure performance  is reconciled to net earnings losses in the following table 
our management believes ebitda is useful to the investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and does not purport to be an alternative to net earnings losses as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
because not all companies use identical calculations  this presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
additionally  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments  tax payments and debt service requirements 
the amounts shown for ebitda  as presented herein  differ from the amounts calculated under the definition of ebitda used in our debt instruments 
the definition of ebitda used in our debt instruments is further adjusted for certain cash and non cash charges and is used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain payments

debt and commitments sources of liquidity 
our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
we also have availability under our revolving credit facility and receivables facilities described below  subject to certain 
table of contents conditions 
see off balance sheet arrangements 
our primary liquidity requirements  which are significant  are expected to be for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and research and development costs 
we intend to draw down on  and use proceeds from  the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facilities and the company s united states and european accounts receivables facilities collectively  the liquidity facilities to fund normal working capital needs from month to month in conjunction with available cash on hand 
as of january   after giving effect to the december  amendment and restatement to the credit agreement as discussed above  we had approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility  approximately million and million under our european accounts receivable facilities and approximately million of availability under our us accounts receivable facility as further discussed below 
during any given month  we anticipate that we will draw as much as an aggregate of million from the liquidity facilities 
the amounts drawn under the liquidity facilities typically will be paid back throughout the month as cash from customers is received 
we may then draw upon such facilities again for working capital purposes in the same or succeeding months 
these borrowings reflect normal working capital utilization of liquidity 
in connection with the acquisition  trw automotive issued the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes  entered into senior credit facilities  consisting of a revolving credit facility and term loan facilities  and initiated a trade accounts receivable securitization program  or the receivables facility 
as of december   we had outstanding  million in aggregate indebtedness  with an additional million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility  after giving effect to million in outstanding letters of credit and guarantees  which reduced the amount available 
as of december   approximately million of our total reported accounts receivable balance was considered eligible for borrowings under our united states receivables facility  of which approximately million would have been available for funding 
we had no outstanding borrowings under this receivables facility as of december  see off balance sheet arrangements for further discussion of our european facilities  which have approximately million and million of funding availability and no outstanding borrowings as of december  funding our requirements 
while we are highly leveraged  we believe that funds generated from operations and planned borrowing capacity will be adequate to fund debt service requirements  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and company sponsored research and development programs 
in addition  we believe that our current financial position and financing plans will provide flexibility in worldwide financing activities and permit us to respond to changing conditions in credit markets 
however  our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors  and the cost of warranty and recall and litigation claims  among other things 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit facility or receivables facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
credit ratings 
set forth below are our credit ratings for standard poor s and moody s as of february  s p moody s corporate bank debt rating bb ba senior note rating bb ba senior subordinated note rating bb b in the event of a downgrade  we believe we would continue to have access to sufficient liquidity  however  the cost of borrowing would increase and our ability to access certain financial markets could be limited

other commitments 
escalating pricing pressure from customers has been a characteristic of the automotive parts industry in recent years 
virtually all oems have policies of seeking price reductions each year 
we have taken steps to reduce costs and resist price reductions  however  price reductions have impacted our sales and profit margins 
if we are not able to offset continued price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures  those price reductions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition to pricing concerns  we continue to be approached by our customers for changes in terms and conditions in our contracts concerning warranty and recall participation and payment terms on product shipped 
we believe that the likely resolution of these proposed modifications will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow

in connection with the acquisition  trw automotive entered into a receivables facility  which  as amended  provides up to million in funding from commercial paper conduits sponsored by commercial lenders  based on availability of eligible receivables and other customary factors

certain of our subsidiaries the sellers sell trade accounts receivables the receivables originated by them in the united states through the receivables facility 
receivables are sold to trw automotive receivables llc the transferor at a discount 
the transferor is a bankruptcy remote special purpose limited liability company that is our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary 
the transferor s purchase of receivables is financed through a transfer agreement with trw automotive global receivables llc the borrower 
under the terms of the transfer agreement  the borrower purchases all receivables sold to the transferor 
the borrower is a bankruptcy remote qualifying special purpose limited liability company that is wholly owned by the transferor and is not consolidated when certain requirements are met as further described below 
generally  multi seller commercial paper conduits supported by committed liquidity facilities are available to provide cash funding for the borrowers purchase of receivables through secured loans tranches to the extent desired and permitted under the receivables loan agreement 
the borrower issues a note to the transferor for the difference between the purchase price the receivables and cash available to be borrowed through the facility 
the sellers of the receivables act as servicing agents per the servicing agreement and continue to service the transferred receivables for which they receive a monthly servicing fee at a rate of per annum of the average daily outstanding balance of receivables 
the usage fee under the facility is of outstanding borrowings 
in addition  we are required to pay a fee of on the unused portion of the receivables facility 
these rates are per annum and payments of these fees are made to the lenders on the monthly settlement date 
availability of funding under the receivables facility depends primarily upon the outstanding trade accounts receivable balance and is determined by reducing the receivables balance by outstanding borrowings under the program  the historical rate of collection on those receivables and other characteristics of those receivables that affect their eligibility such as bankruptcy or downgrading below investment grade of the obligor  delinquency and excessive concentration 
we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of december  this facility can be treated as a general financing agreement or as an off balance sheet financing arrangement 
whether the funding and related receivables are shown as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet  or  conversely  are removed from the consolidated balance sheet depends on the level of the multi seller conduits loans to the borrower 
when such level is at least of the fair value of all of the borrower s assets consisting principally of receivables sold by the sellers  the securitization transactions are accounted for as a sale of the receivables under the provisions of sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and are removed from the consolidated balance sheet 
the proceeds received are included in cash flows from operating activities in the statements of cash flows 
costs associated with the receivables facility are recorded as losses on sale of receivables in our consolidated statement of operations 
the book value of our retained interest in the receivables approximates fair market value due to the current nature of the receivables 
however  at such time as the fair value of the multi seller commercial paper conduits loans are less than of the fair value of all of the borrower s assets  we are required to consolidate the borrower  resulting in the funding and related receivables being shown as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet and the costs associated with the receivables facility being recorded as interest expense 
as there 
table of contents were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables facility on december   the fair value of the multi seller conduits loans was less than of the fair value of all of the borrower s assets and  therefore  the financial position and results of operations of the borrower were included in our consolidated financial statements as of december  in addition to the receivables facility described above as amended  certain of our european subsidiaries entered into receivables financing arrangements in december  january and december we have approximately million available for a term of one year through factoring arrangements in which customers send bills of exchange directly to the bank 
we also have two receivable financing arrangements with availabilities of million and million  respectively 
each of these arrangements is available for a term of one year and each involves a separate wholly owned special purpose vehicle which purchases trade receivables from its domestic affiliates and sells those trade receivables to a domestic bank 
these financing arrangements provide short term financing to meet our liquidity needs 
contingencies various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings are pending or threatened against our subsidiaries  covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities with respect to commercial  patent  product liability  environmental and occupational safety and health law matters 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury and or property damage 
accordingly  we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future 
in addition  our costs to defend the product liability claims have increased over time

while certain of our subsidiaries have been subject in recent years to asbestos related claims  we believe that such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in general  these claims seek damages for illnesses alleged to have resulted from exposure to asbestos used in 
table of contents certain components sold by our subsidiaries 
we believe that the majority of the claimants were assembly workers at the major us automobile manufacturers 
the vast majority of these claims name as defendants numerous manufacturers and suppliers of a wide variety of products allegedly containing asbestos 
we believe that  to the extent any of the products sold by our subsidiaries and at issue in these cases contained asbestos  the asbestos was encapsulated 
based upon several years of experience with such claims  we believe that only a small proportion of the claimants has or will ever develop any asbestos related impairment 
neither our settlement costs in connection with asbestos claims nor our average annual legal fees to defend these claims have been material in the past 
these claims are strongly disputed by us and it has been our policy to defend against them aggressively 
we have been successful in obtaining the dismissal of many cases without any payment whatsoever 
moreover  there is significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers with respect to these claims 
however  while our costs to defend and settle these claims in the past have not been material  we cannot assure you that this will remain so in the future 
we believe that the ultimate resolution of the foregoing matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations

recent accounting pronouncements see note to the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
outlook for full year  the company expects revenue in the range to billion and earnings per diluted share in the range of to  reflecting a less favorable production environment and the impact of higher raw material prices as compared to a year ago 
this guidance range includes approximately million of expenses related to refinancing transactions initiated in the fourth quarter of this guidance also includes net charges of approximately million related to various restructuring actions which are partially offset by pension plan curtailment gains recognized as a result of certain restructuring actions

we expect an annual effective tax rate of approximately to for this effective tax rate guidance is dependent on several assumptions  including the level and mix of future income by taxing jurisdiction  current enacted global corporate tax rates and global corporate tax laws remaining constant 
changes in tax law and rates could have a significant impact on the effective rate 
the overall effective tax rate is equal to consolidated tax expense as a percentage of consolidated earnings before tax 
however  tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional basis 
we are in a position whereby losses incurred in certain jurisdictions provide no current financial statement benefit 
in addition  certain taxing jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the unites states statutory rate 
as such  changes in the mix of projected earnings between jurisdictions could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate 
annually  we purchase large quantities of ferrous metals  resins and textiles for use in our manufacturing process either indirectly as part of purchased components  or directly as raw materials  and therefore we are exposed to the recent inflationary pressures impacting the ferrous metal and resin yarn markets on a worldwide basis 
in addition  and to a much lesser extent  inflationary pressure is now extending into other commodities 
we are also concerned about the viability of the tier and tier supply base as they face these inflationary pressures 
we are monitoring the situation closely and where applicable are working with suppliers and customers to mitigate the potential effect on our financial results 
however  our efforts to mitigate the effects may be insufficient and the pressures may worsen  thus potentially having a negative impact on our financial results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our primary market risk arises from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we manage foreign currency exchange rate risk  interest rate risk  and to a lesser extent commodity price risk  by utilizing various derivative instruments and limit the use of such instruments to hedging activities 
we do not use such instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
if we did not use derivative instruments  our exposure to such risk would be higher 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the derivative financial instruments 
we limit this exposure by entering into agreements directly with a number of major financial institutions that meet our credit standards and that are expected to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we utilize derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks 
forward contracts and  to a lesser extent  options are utilized to protect our cash flow from adverse movements in exchange rates 
these derivative instruments are only used to hedge transactional exposures 
risk associated with translation exposures are not hedged 
transactional currency exposures are reviewed monthly and any natural offsets are considered prior to entering into a derivative financial instrument 
as of december   approximately of our total debt was in foreign currencies compared to at december  interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixed rate debt 
in order to manage interest costs  we utilize interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed and variable rate interest payment obligations over the life of the agreements 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in london inter bank offered rates libor 
as a result of the refinancing on january   we are no longer required under the senior secured credit facilities to maintain interest protection and hedging arrangements to ensure that at least of our consolidated indebtedness would effectively bear interest at a fixed rate for a period of three years 
as of december   approximately of our total debt was at variable interest rates compared to at december  
table of contents sensitivity analysis 
we utilize a sensitivity analysis model to calculate the fair value  cash flows or income statement impact that a hypothetical change in market rates would have on our debt and derivative instruments 
for derivative instruments  we utilized applicable forward rates in effect as of december  to calculate the fair value or cash flow impact resulting from this hypothetical change in market rates 
the results of the sensitivity model calculations follow assuming a assuming a favorable increase decrease unfavorable in prices rates in prices rates change in dollars in millions market risk foreign currency rate sensitive forwards long us fair value short us fair value debt foreign currency denominated fair value interest rate sensitive debt fixed rate fair value variable rate cash flow swaps pay variable receive fixed fair value includes only the risk related to the derivative instruments that serve as hedges and does not include the related underlying hedged item or on other operating transactions 
the analyses also do not factor in a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevailed
