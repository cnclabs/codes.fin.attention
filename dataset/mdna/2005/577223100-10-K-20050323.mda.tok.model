item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
in addition to historical information  the discussion in this document contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock and elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a leading supplier of semiconductor wafer processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits ics 
our manufacturing equipment is used for transistor level  or front end of line manufacturing  and also in specialized applications for processing the interconnect layer  or back end of line processing 
our manufacturing equipment utilizes innovative technology to deliver advanced processing capabilities and high productivity for the fabrication of current and next generation ics 
our tools  technologies and expertise are enablers in the semiconductor industry s transition to larger mm wafers  sub nm design rules and the use of new materials  such as copper  low capacitance low k dielectrics and barrier metals 
our business depends upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices 
because the demand for semiconductor devices is highly cyclical  the demand for wafer processing equipment is also highly cyclical 
declines in demand for semiconductors and for capital equipment occurred throughout  and the first half of  creating a period of great challenge and significant change for us 
during that period  we incurred significant losses 
in and the first quarter of  we took restructuring actions to refocus our business on our core technologies in dry strip strip and rapid thermal processing rtp and to reduce our cost structure 
as part of this restructuring effort  we divested a significant line of business  our wet surface preparation products wet business  in march of as a result of our restructurings in and  our revenue sources and our cost structure have significantly changed 
this affects the comparability of our reported financial information for the annual periods discussed in this report  and it causes our historical information not to be a good indicator or predictor of results for future periods 
as a result of our restructurings and divestitures  we reduced our cost structure and reduced our rate of losses throughout the first three quarters of we achieved a small profit from operations for the fourth quarter of during  we continued to focus on our core technologies in strip and rtp products 
we increased our revenues by to million from million in as a result of our continued efforts to control our operating costs in  our research  development and engineering expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses in total increased by to million  compared with million in overall  we had a year of stable growth in and reported increases in net income for each of the four quarters 
during the first quarter of  we successfully completed an underwritten public offering of approximately million shares of common stock  with net proceeds of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired vortek industries ltd  a privately held developer of millisecond flash annealing technology based in vancouver  canada for a total consideration of million  consisting of approximately million shares of our common stock valued at million and approximately million in cash for acquisition related expenses 
we had million of cash and cash equivalents and no long term debt at december  with the recent improvements in our operating results and the infusion of additional cash on our balance sheet  we believe we are in a healthy position in terms of liquidity and capital resources 
in  we continued to streamline our internal operations and adjust our manufacturing resources with the goal of creating a more flexible organization that can operate profitably through changing industry cycles 
our strategy is to outsource selected non critical functions in manufacturing  spare parts logistics and subsystem design to third parties specializing in these areas 
this allows us to concentrate our resources on our core technologies in strip and rtp  reduce our cost structure and achieve greater flexibility to expand and contract manufacturing capacity as market conditions require 
although we have implemented cost cutting and operational flexibility measures  we are largely dependent upon increases in sales in order to improve our profitability 
the cyclicality and uncertainties regarding overall market conditions continue to present significant challenges to us and impair our ability to forecast near term revenue 
given that many of our costs are fixed in the short term  our ability to quickly modify our operations in response to changes in market conditions is limited 
going forward  the success of our business will be dependent on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for semiconductors and semiconductor wafer processing equipment and our ability to a develop and bring to market new products that address our customers needs  b grow customer loyalty through collaboration with and support of our customers and c maintain a cost structure that will enable us to operate effectively and profitably throughout changing industry cycles 
after this overview  we will provide discussion of the following topics to help understand our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements summary of our critical accounting policies discussion of results of operations liquidity and capital resources acquisition and divestures capital finance transactions reclassifications certain prior period amounts have been reclassified 
these reclassifications do not affect our net income or loss  cash flows or stockholders equity 
loss on disposition of wet business in we had previously reported in a loss on disposition of wet business of million after income loss from operations 
we have reclassified this loss to be included as part of income loss from operations for see note to consolidated financial statements 
dns settlement income in we had previously reported in the receipt of million related to the dns litigation settlement as other income expense  net 
we have reclassified this to net sales for the reclassification of this amount increases our reported net sales for to million 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
auction rate securities from through the third fiscal quarter of we have reclassified certain auction rate securities from cash equivalents to short term investments 
auction rate securities are variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of days 
auction rate securities have interest rate resets through a modified dutch auction  at pre determined short term intervals  usually every  or days 
they trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer 
interest paid during a given period is based upon the interest rate determined during the prior auction 
although these securities are issued and rated as long term bonds  they are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset 
we had historically classified these instruments as cash equivalents if the period between interest rate resets was days or less  which was based on our ability to either liquidate our holdings or roll our investment over to the next reset period 
based upon our re evaluation of these securities  we have reclassified our auction rate securities  previously classified as cash equivalents  as short term investments for each of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the reclassification results in reclassification to short term investments of million and million at december  and  respectively 
we sold all auction rate securities in november in addition  purchases of investments and sales of investments  included in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  have been revised to reflect the purchase and sale of auction rate securities during the periods presented 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty obligations  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  warranty obligations  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets and income taxes as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
we account for equipment sales as follows for equipment sales of existing products with new specifications and for all sales of new products and  for the first quarter of and earlier periods  for all sales of wet surface preparation products  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  for equipment sales to existing customers who have purchased the same equipment with the same specifications and previously demonstrated acceptance provisions  or equipment sales to new customers purchasing existing products with established reliability  we recognize revenue on a multiple element approach in which we bifurcate a sale transaction into two separate elements based on objective evidence of fair value 
the two elements are the tool and installation of the tool 
under this approach  the portion of the invoice price that is due upon shipment  generally of the total invoice price  is recognized as revenue upon shipment and title transfer of the tool  and the remaining portion of the total invoice price  generally of the total invoice price  which is due once installation services have been accepted  is not recognized as revenue until final customer acceptance of the tool 
from time to time  however  we allow customers to evaluate systems  and since customers can return such systems at any time with limited or no penalty  we do not recognize revenue until these evaluation systems are accepted by the customers 
revenues associated with sales to customers in japan are recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurs upon customer acceptance  with the exception of sales of rtp products through our distributor in japan  where we recognize revenues upon title transfer to the distributor 
for spare parts  we recognize revenue upon shipment 
we recognize service and maintenance contract revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
accounts receivable for which revenue has not been recognized are classified as advance billings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
warranty 
the warranty we offer on system sales generally ranges from months to months  depending on the product 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty  based on historical costs  is recorded as a cost of sales when the revenue is recognized for the sale of the equipment or parts 
our warranty obligations require us to repair or replace defective products or parts  generally at a customer s site  during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
the actual system performance and or field expense profiles may differ from historical experience  and in those cases  we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot be certain that we will continue to experience the same warranty costs that we have had in the past 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis  and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
when the terms of sale do not specify  we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 
all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts  in each reporting period 
although we attempt to accurately forecast future inventory demand  given the competitive pressures and cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  there may be significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and we also review goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
goodwill and intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with business acquisitions 
the value assigned to goodwill and intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
a severe decline in market conditions could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not to be impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of our reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
there were no events or changes in circumstances during the first three quarters of which triggered an impairment review 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our first step annual impairment test based on management estimates and fair value assessments  which did not indicate any impairment  thus the second step was not necessary 
impairment of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
during the years ended december  and  we did not record any impairment charge 
during the year ended december   we recorded an aggregate impairment loss of million for property and equipment  intangible assets and other long lived assets because the carrying amounts of such assets exceeded the estimated future cash flows from the use of such assets 
income taxes 
we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as we expect it is more likely than not that we will not realize our net deferred tax asset as of december  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which would increase income in the period of adjustment 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated  expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit margin operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring and other charges loss on disposition of wet business income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss before cumulative effect of change income loss from operations has been changed as a result of the reclassification of the million loss on disposition of wet business for see reclassifications in note to consolidated financial statements

see reclassifications in note to consolidated financial statements 
net sales year ended december  in thousands  except percentages net sales    change from prior year   the increase in net sales in compared with was primarily due to an increase in strip and rtp system and spare parts sales of million  or  partially offset by the decrease in wet product sales of million as a result of our divesture of the wet business in of the million increase  million resulted from higher strip and rtp system sales for compared with in  over of our business was for mm products 
in  we received business from leading chipmakers in all regions we serve china  europe  japan  korea  singapore  taiwan and the united states 
our net sales for included royalty income of million  compared with million for the decrease in net sales in compared with was primarily due to the divestiture of the wet business on march  net sales of wet business products were million in  a decrease of million from net sales of million in net sales of strip and rtp products for were million  an increase of from million in the increase in net sales of strip and rtp products was primarily due to increased units sold 
net sales for and included million and million of revenue from dns royalties  respectively 
see reclassifications in note to consolidated financial statements 
our deferred revenue at december  was approximately million  a decrease of million from million at december  the million in deferred revenue consisted of million of deferred revenue related to installation services awaiting completion for sales of established products  million of deferred revenue related to recently introduced or beta products shipped and awaiting customer acceptance and million in advanced payments related to dns royalties 
the decline in deferred revenue in compared with was primarily a result of million in dns royalty payments recognized during and a net million decrease in deferred revenue related to newly introduced products  as we began to receive customer acceptances related to our helios product 
our deferred revenue at december  was million  a decrease of million from million at december   reflecting our divestiture of the wet business early in the million in deferred revenue at the end of consisted of million of deferred revenue related to installation services awaiting completion for sales of established products  million of deferred revenue related to tools shipped and awaiting customer acceptance and million in advanced payments related to dns royalties 
international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe  japan and the pacific rim  including china  korea  singapore and taiwan accounted for of total net sales for both and  and of total net sales for we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales 
gross profit and gross profit margin year ended december  in thousands  except percentages gross profit    change from prior year   the increase in gross profit for compared with was primarily due to increased system sales  in particular from our higher margin products  including our next generation mm rtp system  the helios 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy as it pertains to new products  we recognized no revenues related to shipments of our helios products made in helios related sales were reported as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet at december  gross profit reported for helios sales recognized in amounted to approximately million 
improved direct labor and overhead absorption for compared with resulted in an increase in gross margin of million 
additionally  in the company benefited from improved reliability of installed systems  and accordingly was able to carry lower reserves for retrofitting costs  thereby increasing gross profit by million 
our net sales for included royalty income of million received from dns  compared with million for and million for see reclassifications in note to consolidated financial statements 
the royalty income carries no associated cost of sales 
gross profit for improved compared with  primarily due to improvements in our inventory management 
we recorded inventory valuation charges of million for  an decrease from charges of million 
due to the reclassification of million in settlement payments from dns as net sales for see reclassifications in note to consolidated financial statements  our gross profit for improved to million  compared with million reported in our previous reports 
year ended december  percentages gross profit margin the improved gross profit margin for compared with was primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products  particularly our helios rtp system 
the improved gross profit margin for compared with was primarily due to improved facility utilization and other efficiencies gained from the divestiture of the wet business  and a greater proportion of strip and rtp product sales  as well as spare parts and service revenues  with relatively higher margins 
gross profit margin in both and was also favorably impacted by improvements in our inventory management 
we had no inventory valuation charge in  compared with inventory valuation charges of million for and million for in addition  due to the reclassification of million in litigation settlement payments to net sales for see reclassifications in note to consolidated financial statements  our gross profit margin for improved to from reported in our previous reports 
due to intense competition  we continue to face pricing pressure that can affect our gross profit margin 
in  we continued to increase the proportion of manufacturing work performed by outsourcing partners 
this outsourcing strategy is a key element of our cyclically flexible enterprise business model  which is designed to enable us to expand and contract our manufacturing capacity to meet market conditions 
our gross profit margin has varied over the years and will continue to be affected by many factors  including competitive pressures  product mix  economies of scale and overhead absorption levels 
research  development and engineering year ended december  in thousands  except percentages research  development and engineering    percentage of net sales change from prior year  research  development and engineering rd e expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for our rd e staff as well as contractors fees and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and development of new products 
the increase in rd e expense in compared with was primarily due to higher employee related costs as a result of increased headcount of our rd e function 
as a percentage of net sales  our rd e expenses decreased in compared with because of increased net sales 
the decrease in rd e expenses in compared with was primarily due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense by million resulting from the divestiture of our wet business in march  a million credit for cost sharing with an alliance partner in connection with an rd e project and a reduction in personnel and associated costs by million 
selling  general and administrative year ended december  in thousands  except percentages selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales change from prior year   sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of personnel involved in the sales and marketing process  outside service costs  sales commissions  advertising and promotional materials  sales facilities expense  trade shows and seminars 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  administration  operations and general management  headquarters and general office facilities costs  as well as legal and accounting expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in compared with was primarily the result of additional variable expenses that come with a higher level of business activity  primarily related to an increase in outside service charges of million as a result of increased outsourcing 
in  we continued to streamline our internal operations and adjust our resources through outsourcing in an effort to create a more flexible organization that can operate profitably through changing industry cycles 
as a percentage of net sales  our sg a expenses decreased in compared to because we achieved higher net sales while better controlling our sg a expenses in the decrease in sg a expenses in compared with was primarily due to the divestiture of our wet business in march  other restructuring and cost control measures which included a reduction in personnel and related costs by million  reduction in rent expenses for buildings by million  reduction in outside professional services by million  reduction in depreciation expense by million  reduction in sales commissions by million  and reduction in travel expenses by million 
amortization of intangibles year ended december  in thousands  except percentages amortization of intangibles    percentage of net sales change from prior year  upon adoption of sfas goodwill and other intangible assets on january   we no longer amortize goodwill 
amortization expenses decreased in compared with primarily due to a reduction in intangibles resulting from the divesture of our wet business in in  higher amortization expense is expected due to the amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of vortek industries ltd 
we estimate our amortization expense to be million for restructuring and other charges year ended december  in thousands  except percentages restructuring and other charges  percentage of net sales change from prior year  during  we made cash payments of  in connection with our severance accrual 
during  we made total cash payments of  in connection with our building facilities related to our restructuring plan  and released  in unused facility related reserve balances to the consolidated statement of operations  resulting in a remaining reserve of  for consolidation of excess facilities 
in connection with our consolidation of excess facilities into our current headquarters based in fremont  california in  we accrued for lease termination costs of  in december as a result  we had no restructuring charges recorded for and had  in facilities related restructuring accruals as of december  see note to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in restructuring and other charges for compared with was primarily due to insignificant new restructuring activities during we recorded restructuring and other charges of  in  including  for workforce reductions in fremont and germany and  for consolidation of excess facilities in california 
in connection with the workforce reductions  we terminated employees 
our other restructuring activities during were mainly limited to the further completion of the restructuring plan initiated in in the last two quarters of  in response to the downturn in the semiconductor industry  we performed assessments of the carrying values of our long lived assets to be held and used  including property and equipment and other intangible assets 
as a result of these assessments  we recorded a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment  intangible assets and other long term assets 
the charge of million included million for impaired and abandoned property and equipment  million for the write off of intangible assets for developed technology  and million for impairment of other long lived assets 
additionally  we recorded restructuring charges related to our workforce reduction and consolidation of excess facilities in the amount of million and million  respectively 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
we anticipated that the restructuring actions implemented in would result in an annual savings of depreciation and amortization expenses of million through  estimated savings on employee costs of million and rent expense for leased facilities of million 
interest and other income expense  net year ended december  in thousands  except percentages interest expense  percentage of net sales change from prior year  interest income percentage of net sales change from prior year  other income expense  net percentage of net sales change from prior year   interest income remained flat in compared with  despite higher cash and cash equivalent balances  primarily due to lower average interest rates 
interest income decreased in compared with  primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalent balances and lower average interest rates 
interest expense for and remained minimal 
interest expense of million during was primarily related to interest on our notes payable to steag electronic systems ses 
the increase in other income expense  net in compared with was primarily due to gains on forward foreign exchange contracts 
we had reported in an amount of million related to the dns settlement to other income expense  net 
this amount related to damages and partial reimbursements of attorney fees 
we reclassified this amount to net sales for see note to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in other expense in compared with was primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange losses  which was million in provision for income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million for the year ended december   compared with a tax expense of approximately million for the year ended december   and a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the tax benefit in was primarily due to a tax benefit of million resulting from reduced foreign income tax liabilities  and a onetime tax benefit of million related to a refund of taxes that had been previously withheld and expensed at the time of our dns settlement in the third quarter of  which were partially offset by tax expenses related to foreign operations 
the tax expense in primarily consisted of tax expense related to foreign operations 
the tax benefit in primarily resulted from amortization of identifiable intangibles acquired in and the receipt of a federal tax refund  which were partially offset by tax expenses related to foreign operations

credit arrangements we have a million revolving line of credit with a bank 
in  the terms of this line of credit were amended  giving us the right to increase the line of credit to million at our option  and extending the line of credit through april all borrowings under this credit line bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus basis points 
the line of credit is collateralized by a blanket lien on all of our domestic assets including intellectual property 
the line of credit requires us to satisfy certain quarterly financial covenants  including maintaining a minimum consolidated cash balance and a domestic minimum cash balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and a minimum balance of investment accounts  and not exceeding a maximum net loss limit 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants and there was no borrowing under this credit line 
our japanese subsidiary has a credit facility with a japanese bank in the amount of million yen approximately million at december   collateralized by specific trade accounts receivable of the japanese subsidiary 
the facility is subject to the short term prime rate  which was per annum as of december  the facility will continue indefinitely unless either party notifies the other party to terminate the facility 
we have given a corporate guarantee for this credit facility 
there are no financial covenant requirements for this credit facility 
at december   the japanese subsidiary had approximately  of off balance sheet recourse liability related to a commercial bill discounted under this credit facility 
on march  our japanese subsidiary entered into an overdraft facility with a japanese bank in the amount of million yen approximately million at december  
the facility is not collateralized and is subject to variable interest rates 
the facility will expire on march  there are no financial covenant requirements for this credit facility 
at december   there was no borrowing under this credit facility off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that are material to investors 
contractual obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in our consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on our liquidity 
in connection with the disposition of the wet business  we assumed the lease obligations with respect to the facilities used to house the manufacturing and administrative functions of the transferred wet business in pliezhausen  germany 
that lease was due to expire on august   with an approximate rental cost of million annually 
we sublet the facilities to scp global technologies scp on terms that covered all rent and costs payable by us under the primary lease 
under the sublease  we were to receive from scp sublease payments of approximately million per annum  and scp had the right upon days notice to partially or completely terminate the sublease 
in the second quarter of  scp terminated the sublease completely  and we became responsible for the future lease costs of approximately million through august  net of cost recovery efforts and any sublease income 
in december  we entered into an agreement with the landlord to terminate the lease early and agreed to pay million euros approximately million in four installments from january through september as a result  we are released from any further legal commitments under the lease with effect from january  we had fully accrued for the costs related to this lease 
see notes  and to consolidated financial statements 
our contractual commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table vendor commitments operating lease payments sublease income subcontractor inventory other total in thousands thereafter  in connection with the acquisition of vortek industries ltd  we became party to an agreement between vortek and the canadian minister of industry the minister relating to an investment in vortek by technology partnerships canada 
under that agreement  as amended  we or vortek agreed to various covenants  including a payment by us of a royalty to the minister of of revenues from flash rtp products  up to a total of cad  approximately million at december   and b vortek maintaining a specified average workforce of employees in canada through october  if we  or vortek  do not satisfy our obligations  the minister may demand payment of liquidated damages in the amount of cad  approximately million at december  less any royalties paid by vortek or us to the minister 
other commitments and legal settlement on july   we timely retired two obligations  of million and million euros  including accrued interest thereon  and made payments in full to steag electronic systems ag in the total amount of approximately million 
on june   we entered into a settlement agreement and a license agreement with dns under which dns agreed to make payments to us totaling between million minimum and million maximum  relating to past damages  partial reimbursement of attorney fees and costs  and license fees 
as of december   dns has made payments aggregating million under the terms of the settlement and license agreements 
of the million paid by dns to us through december   million was subjected to japanese withholding tax 
in december  we received million withholding tax refund from the japanese tax authority in respect of dns s payments to the company 
we are scheduled to receive minimum annual royalty payments of million in  and  totaling million 
liquidity and capital resources outlook as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash and short term investments of million 
we believe that these balances  including interest to be earned thereon  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements over the course of the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
in the normal course of business  we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses 
we may use available cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments to fund such activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all

acquisitions and divestitures acquisition of vortek industries ltd 
on october   we acquired certain outstanding debt and equity ownership interests in vortek industries ltd 
vortek  a privately held corporation amalgamated under the laws of british columbia for a total purchase price of million 
vortek is based in vancouver  canada 
the purchase price consisted of approximately million shares of mattson common stock valued at approximately million  and approximately million in cash for acquisition related expenses 
prior to the closing date of the vortek acquisition october   mattson provided loans to vortek aggregating million 
these loans still existed at december  and were eliminated in consolidation 
as a result of the transaction  vortek became our wholly owned subsidiary 
vortek is a developer of millisecond flash annealing technology for rapid thermal processing of silicon wafers used in the manufacture of semiconductors 
of the shares of common stock we issued in the vortek transaction   the escrow shares are being held subject to an escrow agreement 
the escrow shares are subject to forfeiture in the event of valid indemnification claims within a period of months from october  in connection with the vortek acquisition  we entered into a stock registration and restriction agreement  dated as of october   pursuant to which we agreed to register the shares issued in the vortek acquisition  other than the escrow shares  under the securities act of  for resale by the recipients subject to certain restrictions on the transfer of such shares 
this acquisition was consummated principally to expand and strengthen our rtp technology portfolio and support our long term growth strategy 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction and accordingly  the tangible assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition based on management estimates and relative fair value assessments 
the results of operations of vortek have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date 
our preliminary allocation of the purchase price is summarized as follows purchase price allocation in thousands goodwill  existing technology estimated useful life of years  current assets  property  plant and equipment liabilities assumed  deferred tax liability on intangibles  total purchase price  in addition  we acquired cad million approximately million at december  of deferred tax asset in connection with the acquisition of vortek 
if realized  the amount will be first used to reduce the amount of goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition before reducing the tax provision 
divesture of wet business on march   we sold the portion of our business that related to developing  manufacturing  selling  and servicing wet surface preparation products for the cleaning and preparation of semiconductor wafers the wet business to scp global technologies  inc scp 
we had originally acquired the wet business on january   as part of our merger with the semiconductor division of steag electronic systems ag steag and cfm technologies  inc cfm 
as part of this disposition  scp acquired certain subsidiaries and assets  and assumed certain contracts relating to the wet business  including the operating assets  customer contracts and inventory of cfm  all outstanding stock of mattson technology ip  inc mattson ip  a subsidiary that owned various patents relating to the wet business  and all equity ownership interest in mattson wet products gmbh  a subsidiary in germany that owned our principal wet business operations 
we retained rights to all the cash from the wet business entities  and all rights to payments under the settlement and license agreements with dainippon screen manufacturing co  ltd 
dns 
see note scp acquired the rights to any damages under pending patent litigation relating to patents owned by mattson ip 
scp assumed responsibility for the operations  sales  marketing and technical support services for our former wet product lines worldwide 
scp paid us the initial purchase price of million in cash 
that initial purchase price was subject to adjustment based on a number of criteria  including the net working capital of the wet business at closing  to be determined post closing based on a pro forma closing date balance sheet  and an earn out  up to an aggregate maximum of million  payable to the company based upon sales by scp of certain products to identified customers through december  there had been no earn out received through the period ended december  under the terms of the disposition  we remained responsible after the closing for negotiating with the workers council and funding a significant reduction in force for the wet business operations in germany  agreed to provide transitional support of information services  spare parts logistics and certain other functions in support of the wet business for an extended period  retained certain real property leases relating to transferred facilities in germany  subject to a sublease to scp  agreed to reimburse specified legal fees to the extent incurred by scp in pursuit of existing wet business litigation  and remained responsible for resolving or funding resolution of specified customer responsibilities 
we received the right to earn out payments  as described above  and retained the right to payments under the dns settlement 
as a result of the significant continuing involvement by us subsequent to the disposition  the transaction was accounted for as a sale of assets and liabilities 
on december   we signed a second amendment to stock and asset purchase agreement for wet products division the second amendment with scp 
under the terms of the second amendment  we paid million to scp in satisfaction of all further liabilities relating to i working capital adjustments  ii pension obligations  iii reductions in force in germany iv reimbursement of legal fees  and v reimbursement of amounts necessary to cover specified customer responsibilities 
during  as part of the loss on disposition of the wet business  we recorded accruals of approximately million to cover the future obligations relating to this transaction 
we paid million relating to reductions in force  working capital adjustment  investment banker s fees  legal fees  and accounting and other professional fees  which were charged against accruals established at the closing of the sale 
pursuant to the second amendment on december   we had no further obligation to scp relating to the sale of the wet business 
in connection with the disposition of the wet business  we retained the lease obligations with respect to the facilities used to house the manufacturing and administrative functions of the transferred wet business in pliezhausen  germany 
that lease was due to expire on august   with an approximate rental cost of million annually 
we sublet the facilities to scp global technologies scp on terms that covered all rent and costs payable by us under the primary lease 
under the sublease  we were to receive from scp sublease payments of approximately million per annum  and scp had the right upon days notice to partially or completely terminate the sublease 
in the second quarter of  scp terminated the sublease completely 
we became responsible for the future lease costs of approximately million through august  net of cost recovery efforts and any sublease income 
in december  we entered into an agreement with the landlord to terminate the lease early and agreed to pay million euros approximately million in four installments from january through september the landlord for this property is an affiliate of steag electronic systems ag  our largest stockholder 
as a result  we were released from any further legal commitments under the lease with effect from january  we had fully accrued for the costs related to this lease 
see notes  and to consolidated financial statements 
capital finance transactions and dns settlement on february   we sold approximately million newly issued shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering priced at per share 
this resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in the same offering  steag electronic systems ag ses sold approximately million outstanding shares 
following this public offering  ses remains our largest stockholder  holding approximately million shares  or approximately percent  of the million shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  on april   we issued million shares of common stock in a private placement transaction 
of the million shares issued  million shares were issued to ses upon conversion of million of outstanding promissory notes at per share 
the remaining million shares were sold to other investors at per share for aggregate net cash proceeds of million 
on june   we settled a patent infringement lawsuit with dainippon screen manufacturing co  ltd 
dns 
as part of the settlement  dns agreed to pay us  at minimum  million  relating to past damages  partial reimbursement of attorney s fees and costs and royalties  payable in varying amounts at varying dates through april   in return for our granting dns a worldwide license under the previously infringed patents 
depending on the volume of future product sales by dns  we could receive up to an additional million in royalty payments 
we determined  based on relative fair values  how much of the aggregate payments due to us are attributable to past damages and how much are attributable to future royalties on dns sales of wet processing products 
based on our analysis  we allocated million to past damages  which we recorded as net sales during  and we allocated million to royalty income  which is being recognized in our income statements on a straight line basis over the license term 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical  periodically has severe and prolonged downturns  and causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
we are exposed to the risks associated with industry overcapacity  including reduced capital expenditures  decreased demand for our products  increased price competition and delays by our customers in paying for our products 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns  whether as the result of general economic changes or capacity growth temporarily exceeding growth in demand for semiconductor devices 
our business depends in significant part upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices  including manufacturers that open new or expand existing facilities 
periods of overcapacity and reductions in capital expenditures by our customers cause decreases in demand for our products 
if existing fabrication facilities are not expanded and new facilities are not built  demand for our systems may not develop or increase  and we may be unable to generate significant new orders for our systems 
if we are unable to develop new orders for our systems  we will not achieve anticipated net sales levels 
during periods of declining demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  our customers typically reduce purchases  delay delivery of ordered products and or cancel orders  resulting in reduced revenues and backlog  delays in revenue recognition and excess inventory 
increased price competition may result  causing pressure on our gross margin and net income 
we are currently experiencing a downturn in orders and cannot predict what the magnitude or duration of the downturn will be 
during the downturn in and  we were unable to reduce our expenses quickly enough to avoid incurring losses 
during those periods  our net losses were million and million  respectively 
in the current and future downturns  if we are unable to effectively align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions  we could again experience losses  may be required to undertake additional cost cutting measures  and may be unable to continue to invest in marketing  research and development and engineering at the levels we believe are necessary to maintain our competitive position in our core businesses 
our failure to make these investments could seriously harm our long term business prospects 
we depend on large purchases from a few customers  and any cancellation  reduction or delay of purchases by  or failure to collect receivables from  these customers could harm our business 
currently  we derive most of our revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of systems to a relatively small number of customers  which makes our relationship with each customer critical to our business 
the list prices on our systems range from million to over million 
consequently  any order cancellations  delays in scheduled shipments  delays in customer acceptances or delays in collection of accounts receivable could materially adversely affect our operating results and cause our results to fall below our expectations and the expectations of market analysts or investors 
delays in collection of accounts receivable could require us to increase our accounts receivable reserve  which would increase our operating expenses 
our list of major customers changes substantially from year to year  and we cannot predict whether a major customer in one year will make significant purchases from us in future years 
additionally  our customers capital budget considerations and our lengthy sales cycle make the timing of customer orders uneven and difficult to predict 
accordingly  it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenues and operating results from year to year 
if we are unable to collect a receivable from a large customer  our financial results will be negatively impacted 
our backlog orders are subject to cancellation or delay 
although we maintain a backlog of customer orders with expected shipment dates within the next months  customers may request cancellations or delivery delays 
as a result  our backlog may not be a reliable indication of our future revenues 
if shipments of orders in backlog are cancelled or delayed  our revenues could fall below our expectations and the expectations of market analysts and investors 
delays or technical and manufacturing difficulties incurred in the introduction of new products could be costly and adversely affect our customer relationships 
our success depends in part on the continual introduction of new and improved systems and processes 
our products are complex  and we may experience delays and technical or manufacturing difficulties in the prototype introduction of new systems and enhancements  or in achieving volume production of new systems or enhancements 
our inability to overcome such difficulties  to meet the technical specifications of any new systems or enhancements  or to manufacture and ship these systems or enhancements in volume and in a timely manner  would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  as well as our customer relationships 
we may from time to time incur unanticipated costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of our products early in their life cycles  and such costs can be substantial 
if we encounter reliability or quality problems with our new products or enhancements  we could face a number of difficulties  including reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collection of accounts receivable and additional service and warranty expenses  all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we may not achieve anticipated revenue levels if we are not selected as vendor of choice for new or expanded fabrication facilities  or if our systems and products do not achieve broader market acceptance 
because semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to install and integrate capital equipment into a semiconductor fabrication facility  these manufacturers will tend to choose semiconductor equipment manufacturers based on established relationships  product compatibility and proven financial performance 
once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular vendor s capital equipment  the manufacturer generally relies for a significant period of time upon equipment from this vendor of choice for the specific production line application 
in addition  the semiconductor manufacturer frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendors 
accordingly  we may face narrow windows of opportunity to be selected as the vendor of choice by significant new customers 
it may be difficult for us to sell to a particular customer for a significant period of time once that customer selects a competitor s product  and we may not be successful in obtaining broader acceptance of our systems and technology 
if we are unable to achieve broader market acceptance of our systems and technology  we may be unable to maintain and grow our business and our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we must continually anticipate technology trends  improve our existing products and develop new products in order to be competitive 
the development of new or enhanced products involves significant risk and cost 
the markets in which we and our customers compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and services 
consequently  our success depends upon our ability to anticipate future technology trends and customer needs  to develop new systems and processes that meet customer requirements and industry standards and that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance  and to continually improve our existing systems and processes 
our development and manufacture of new products involves significant risk  since the products are very complex and the development cycle is long and expensive 
the success of any new systems we develop and introduce is dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to correctly predict customer requirements for new processes  to assess and select the potential technologies for research and development  and to timely complete new system designs that are acceptable to the market 
we may make substantial investments in new technologies before we can know whether they are technically or commercially feasible or advantageous  and without any assurance that revenue from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the associated development costs 
not all development activities result in commercially viable products 
we may be adversely affected by manufacturing inefficiencies and the challenge of producing innovative systems in volume which meet customer requirements 
we may not be able to improve our existing systems or develop new technologies or systems in a timely manner 
we may exceed the budgeted cost of reaching our research  development and engineering objectives  and planned product development schedules may require extension 
any delays or additional development costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
as we continue our work to implement and improve our new enterprise resource planning and financial statement consolidation systems  unexpected problems could occur and could cause disruption to the management of our business and delays or errors in the preparation of our financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  as part of a multi phase process  we completed the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system for our worldwide operations 
the new erp system has become integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records  record our transactions  provide critical information to our management  and prepare our financial statements 
in recent periods  we have implemented other phases of the erp system and implemented new financial systems to aid in the consolidation of our financial reporting 
our work to implement and improve our new computerized consolidation and erp systems continues as an active project 
these systems are new to us and we have not had extensive experience with them 
the new erp and consolidation systems could eventually become more costly  difficult and time consuming to purchase and implement than we currently anticipate 
implementation of the new erp system has required us to change internal business practices  transfer records to a new computer system and train our employees in the correct use and input of data into the system 
we may discover that errors have been made in converting to or using the new systems  or encounter unexpected difficulties or costs or other challenges  any of which may disrupt our business or cause errors or delays in the reporting of our financial results 
our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations and require us to change our internal business practices 
corrections and improvements may be required as we continue the implementation of our new systems  procedures and controls  and could cause us to incur additional costs and require additional management attention  placing burdens on our internal resources 
if we fail to manage these changes effectively  it could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our operating results 
our results of operations may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventory 
we need to manage our inventory of component parts  work in process and finished goods effectively to meet customer delivery demands at an acceptable risk and cost 
customers are increasingly requiring very short lead times for delivery  which may require us to purchase and carry additional inventory 
for both the inventories that support manufacture of our products and our spare parts inventories  if the customer demand we anticipate does not materialize in a timely manner  we will incur increased carrying costs and some inventory could become un saleable or obsolete  resulting in write offs which would adversely affect the results of our operations 
warranty claims in excess of our projections could seriously harm our business 
we offer a warranty on our products 
the cost associated with our warranty is significant  and in the event our projections and estimates of this cost are inaccurate  our financial performance could be seriously harmed 
in addition  if we experience product failures at an unexpectedly high level  our reputation in the marketplace could be damaged  and our business would suffer 
we are increasingly outsourcing manufacturing and logistics activities to third party service providers  which decreases our control over the performance of these functions 
we have already outsourced certain manufacturing and spare parts logistics functions to third party service providers  and we may outsource more of those functions in the future 
while we expect to achieve operational flexibility and cost savings as a result of this outsourcing  outsourcing has a number of risks and reduces our control over the performance of the outsourced functions 
significant performance problems by these third party service providers could result in cost overruns  delayed deliveries  shortages  quality issues or other problems that could result in significant customer dissatisfaction and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if for any reason one or more of these third party service providers becomes unable or unwilling to continue to provide services of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  our ability to deliver our products or spare parts to our customers could be severely impaired 
we would quickly need to identify and qualify substitute service providers or increase our internal capacity  which could be expensive  time consuming and difficult  and could result in unforeseen operations problems 
substitute service providers might not be available or  if available  might be unwilling or unable to offer services on acceptable terms 
if customer demand for our products increases  we may be unable to secure sufficient additional capacity from our current service providers on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our requirements are expected to represent a small portion of the total capacities of our third party service providers  and they may preferentially allocate capacity to other customers  even during periods of high demand for our products 
in addition  such manufacturers could suffer financial difficulties or disruptions in their operations due to causes beyond our control 
we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor equipment industry 
the semiconductor equipment industry is both highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors include the following system performance  cost of ownership  size of installed base  breadth of product line  delivery availability  and customer support 
competitive pressure has been increasing in several areas 
in particular  there is increased price competition  and customers are waiting to make purchase commitments  which are then placed with demands for rapid delivery dates and increased product support 
our major competitors are larger than we are  have greater capital resources  and may have a competitive advantage over us by virtue of having broader product lines  longer operating history  greater experience with high volume manufacturing  substantially larger customer bases  the ability to reduce price through product bundling  and substantially greater customer support  financial  technical  and marketing resources 
in addition  to expand our sales we must often replace the systems of our competitors or sell new systems to customers of our competitors 
our competitors may develop new or enhanced competitive products that will offer price or performance features that are superior to our systems 
our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and on site customer support of their product lines 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our sales if competition increases and we are unable to respond effectively 
our lengthy sales cycle increases our costs and reduces the predictability of our revenue 
sales of our systems depend upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase or replace manufacturing capacity  typically involving a significant capital commitment 
accordingly  the decision to purchase our systems requires time consuming internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation  and introduction of new technologies into our customers manufacturing facilities 
even after the customer determines that our systems meet their qualification criteria  we may experience delays finalizing system sales while the customer obtains approval for the purchase  constructs new facilities  or expands its existing facilities 
consequently  the time between our first contact with a customer regarding a specific potential purchase and the customer s placing its first order may last from nine to twelve months or longer 
we may incur significant sales and marketing expenses during this evaluation period 
in addition  the length of this period makes it difficult to accurately forecast future sales 
if sales forecasted from a specific customer are not realized  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues and our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
we are highly dependent on international sales  and face significant economic and regulatory risks 
international sales accounted for of our net sales in  of our net sales in  and of our net sales in we anticipate international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our future net sales 
asia has been a particularly important region for our business  and we anticipate that it will continue to be important as we expand our sales and marketing efforts in asia 
our sales to customers located in taiwan  japan  china  korea and other asian countries accounted for of our net sales in  of our net sales in  and of our net sales in because of our continuing dependence upon international sales  we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities  including unexpected changes in law or regulations resulting in more burdensome governmental controls  tariffs  taxes  restrictions  embargoes  or export license requirements  exchange rate volatility  the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and us export laws  political and economic instability  particularly in asia  differing labor regulations  reduced protection for intellectual property  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations 
in the us and asia excluding japan  our sales to date have been denominated primarily in us dollars  while our sales in japan are usually denominated in japanese yen 
our sales to date in europe have been denominated in various currencies  currently primarily us dollars and the euro 
our sales in foreign currencies are subject to risks of currency fluctuation 
for us dollar sales in foreign countries  our products may become less price competitive when the local currency is declining in value compared to the dollar 
this could cause us to lose sales or force us to lower our prices  which would reduce our gross margins 
in addition  the expenses of our german manufacturing operation are primarily incurred in euros 
if the euro were to appreciate in relation to the us dollar  our operating expenses would increase 
we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for some components and subassemblies  and supply shortages or the loss of these suppliers could result in increased cost or delays in manufacture and sale of our products 
we rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to provide many of the components and subassemblies of our systems 
we obtain some of these components and subassemblies from a sole source or a limited group of suppliers 
because of our anticipated reliance on outside vendors generally  and on a sole or a limited group of suppliers in particular  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required components 
although we currently experience minimal delays in receiving goods from our suppliers  when demand for semiconductor equipment is strong  our suppliers may have difficulty providing components on a timely basis 
in addition  during periods of shortages of components  we may have reduced control over pricing and timely delivery of components 
we often quote prices to our customers and accept customer orders for our products prior to purchasing components and subassemblies from our suppliers 
if our suppliers increase the cost of components or subassemblies  we may not have alternative sources of supply and may no longer be able to increase the cost of the system being evaluated by our customers to cover all or part of the increased cost of components 
the manufacture of some of these components and subassemblies is an extremely complex process and requires long lead times 
if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required components or subassemblies  we may have to seek alternative sources of supply or manufacture such components internally 
this could delay our ability to manufacture or timely ship our systems  causing us to lose sales  incur additional costs  delay new product introductions  and harm our reputation 
we manufacture many of our products at two primary manufacturing facilities and are thus subject to risk of disruption 
although we outsource the manufacturing for certain of our products to third parties  we continue to produce our latest generation products at our two principal manufacturing plants in fremont  california and dornstadt  germany 
we have limited ability to interchangeably produce our products at either facility  and in the event of a disruption of operations at one facility  our other facility would not be able to make up the capacity loss 
our operations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including  but not limited to natural disasters  work stoppages  operational facility constraints and terrorism 
such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers  result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers and seriously harm our business 
because of competition for qualified personnel  we may not be able to recruit or retain necessary personnel  which could impede development or sales of our products 
our growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
there is substantial competition for experienced engineering  technical  financial  sales  and marketing personnel in our industry 
in particular  we must attract and retain highly skilled design and process engineers 
historically  competition for such personnel has been intense in all of our locations  but particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters is located 
if we are unable to retain existing key personnel  or attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we may from time to time experience inadequate levels of staffing to develop and market our products and perform services for our customers 
as a result  our growth could be limited due to our lack of capacity to develop and market our products to our customers  or we could fail to meet our delivery commitments or experience deterioration in service levels or decreased customer satisfaction 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose a valuable asset and experience reduced market share 
efforts to protect our intellectual property may require additional costly litigation 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements  and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may be able to legitimately ascertain the non patented proprietary technology embedded in our systems 
if this occurs  we may not be able to prevent the use of such technology 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any patents owned by us could be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented and any rights granted under any patent may not provide adequate protection to us 
furthermore  we may not have sufficient resources to protect our rights 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology  or design around patents that may be issued to us 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and it may be more difficult to monitor the use of our products in such foreign countries 
as a result of these threats to our proprietary technology  we may have to resort to costly litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we might face patent infringement or other intellectual property infringement claims that may be costly to resolve and could divert management attention 
we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties patents or other proprietary rights 
in addition  we on occasion receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or have other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties 
our involvement in any patent dispute or other intellectual property dispute or action to protect trade secrets  even if the claims are without merit  could be very expensive to defend and could divert the attention of our management 
adverse determinations in any litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek costly licenses from third parties  and prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products
