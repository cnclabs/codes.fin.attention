item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to assist readers in understanding the company s financial performance during the periods presented and significant trends which may impact the future performance of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
company products and operations the company manufactures and markets premium products and services to the oil and gas exploration and production industry  the petrochemical industry and other industrial markets 
the company provides a comprehensive line of technologically advanced products and engineering services  including drilling and completion fluid systems  solids control and separation equipment  waste management services  oilfield production chemicals  three cone and diamond drill bits  turbine products  fishing services  drilling tools  underreamers  casing exit and multilateral systems  packers and liner hangers 
the company also offers supply chain management solutions through an extensive north american branch network providing pipe  valves and fittings as well as mill  safety and other maintenance products 
the company s operations are largely driven by the level of exploration and production e p spending in major energy producing regions around the world and the depth and complexity of these projects 
although e p spending is significantly influenced by the market price of oil and natural gas  it may also be affected by supply and demand fundamentals  finding and development costs  decline and depletion rates  political actions and uncertainties  environmental concerns  the financial condition of independent e p companies and the overall level of global economic growth and activity 
in addition  approximately percent of the company s consolidated revenues relate to the downstream energy sector  including petrochemical plants and refineries  whose spending is largely impacted by the general condition of the us economy 
capital investment by energy companies is largely divided into two markets which vary greatly in terms of primary business drivers and associated volatility levels 
north american drilling activity is primarily influenced by natural gas fundamentals  with approximately percent of the current rig count focused on natural gas finding and development activities 
conversely  drilling in areas outside of north america is more dependent on crude oil fundamentals  which influence over three quarters of international drilling activity 
historically  business in markets outside of north america has proved to be less volatile as the high cost e p programs in these regions are generally undertaken by major oil companies  consortiums and national oil companies as part of a longer term strategic development plan 
although over half of the company s consolidated revenues were generated in north america during  smith s profitability was largely dependent upon business levels in markets outside of north america 
the distribution segment  which accounts for approximately one quarter of consolidated revenues and primarily supports a north american customer base  serves to distort the geographic revenue mix of the company s oilfield segment operations 
excluding the impact of the distribution operations  percent of the company s revenues were generated in markets outside of north america 
business outlook average worldwide activity levels grew percent in  as higher commodity prices influenced natural gas drilling particularly in the us land based market 
the global rig count is expected to increase modestly in  as exploration and production companies focus on higher reserve projects in the us gulf of mexico  europe africa and the middle east markets 
in addition to the anticipated increase in drilling activity and the more favorable product mix which could result from a recovery in the us deepwater market  recently announced price increases in our oilfield segment businesses could also influence near term financial results 
although a number of factors impact drilling activity levels  our business is highly dependent on the general economic environment in the united states and other major world economies which ultimately impact energy consumption and the resulting demand for our products and services 
a significant deterioration in the global economic environment could adversely impact worldwide drilling activity and the future financial results of the company 
forward looking statements this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of concerning  among other things  the company s outlook  financial projections and business strategies  all of which are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
these forward looking statements are identified by their use of terms such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  project and similar terms 
the statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the company that it believes are appropriate under the circumstances 
such statements are subject to general economic and business conditions  industry conditions  changes in laws or regulations and other risk factors outlined elsewhere in this form k  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should the assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary 
results of operations segment discussion the company markets its products and services throughout the world through four business units which are aggregated into two reportable segments 
the oilfield products and services segment consists of three business units m i swaco  smith technologies and smith services 
the distribution segment includes the wilson business unit 
the revenue discussion below has been summarized by business unit in order to provide additional information in analyzing the company s operations 
for the years ended december  amount amount amount financial data dollars in thousands revenues m i swaco    smith technologies    smith services    oilfield products and services

not meaningful oilfield products and services segment revenues m i swaco primarily provides drilling and completion fluid systems  engineering and technical services to the oil and gas industry 
additionally  these operations provide oilfield production chemicals and manufacture and market equipment and services used for solids control  particle separation  pressure control  rig instrumentation and waste management 
m i swaco is significantly influenced by spending in markets outside of north america  which contributes approximately two thirds of the unit s revenues  and by its exposure to the us offshore market  which constitutes approximately percent of the revenue base 
us offshore drilling programs  which account for approximately four percent of the worldwide rig count  are generally more revenue intensive than land based projects due to the complex nature of the related drilling environment 
for the year ended december   m i swaco reported revenues of billion 
the majority of the revenue increase was generated in markets outside of north america  where revenues grew percent largely due to the underlying activity level increase of nine percent 
although increased investment by exploration and production companies in latin america and the middle east contributed to the improvement  new contract awards and increased customer demand for waste management product offerings in several major europe africa markets also had a favorable impact 
approximately one third of the year over year revenue growth was reported in north america  as increased customer spending related to land based projects more than offset the impact of reduced drilling activity in the higher margin us offshore market 
m i swaco s revenues totaled billion for the year ended december   an increase of percent above the prior year period 
excluding the effect of acquired operations  revenues rose percent above levels impacted by increased sales volumes in markets outside of north america 
on a geographic basis  increased e p spending and new contract awards in latin america  the former soviet union and west africa influenced the higher reported revenues 
the year over year base revenue growth was also impacted by the significant increase in the number of north american land based drilling programs and  to a lesser extent  a favorable customer mix in the us offshore market 
smith technologies designs  manufactures and sells three cone drill bits  diamond drill bits and turbines for use in the oil and gas industry 
due to the nature of its product offerings  revenues for these operations typically correlate more closely to the rig count than any of the company s other businesses 
moreover  smith technologies generally has the highest north american revenue exposure of the oilfield segment units 
for the year ended december   smith technologies reported revenues of million  a percent increase over the prior year level 
approximately three quarters of the revenue growth was reported in north america  as increased activity levels impacted demand for diamond bit rentals 
additionally  increased market penetration resulting from new product designs and  to a lesser extent  improved product pricing also contributed to the revenue variance 
smith technologies reported revenues of million for the year ended december   an increase of percent over the prior year 
excluding incremental revenues from businesses acquired in the latter half of  base revenues were approximately percent above the prior year and approximated the increase in the worldwide rig count 
the year to year base revenue growth was generated in north america  reflecting the higher level of land based drilling activity during and  to a lesser extent  the impact of new product introductions 
smith services manufactures and markets products and services used in the oil and gas industry for drilling  work over  well completion and well re entry 
revenues for smith services are evenly distributed between north america and the international markets and are heavily influenced by the complexity of drilling projects  which drive demand for a wider range of its product offerings 
for the year ended december   smith services reported revenues of million  a percent increase over the amount reported in the prior year 
approximately three quarters of the revenue improvement was generated in the north american market  influenced by higher activity levels  increased demand for tubular products and to a lesser extent  incremental revenues from acquired operations 
for the year ended december   smith services reported revenues of million  a two percent increase from the prior year 
the year to year revenue comparison was impacted by a percent reduction in us drill pipe product sales  which are not highly correlated to drilling activity 
excluding the impact of drill pipe sales  revenues increased seven percent above the prior year  primarily attributable to higher e p spending in north america and certain middle east markets 
on a product basis  the majority of the core revenue growth was driven by higher demand for remedial product and service lines  including new product introductions 
operating income operating income for the oilfield products and services segment was million  or percent of revenues  for the year ended december  excluding the impact of a million litigation related charge recorded during  segment operating margins improved percentage points due to gross margin expansion and  to a lesser extent  reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 
the gross margin improvement largely reflects increased fixed cost absorption in the company s manufacturing operations and  to a lesser extent  the impact of price increases introduced in the drilling fluid and drill bit operations 
fiscal operating income  net of the litigation charge  increased million over the prior year attributable to the impact of higher revenue volumes on gross profit  partially offset by growth in variable based operating expenses associated with the expanding business base 
for the year ended december   oilfield operating income was million  or percent of revenues 
segment operating margins increased one percentage point above the prior year level reflecting a combination of gross margin expansion and  to a lesser extent  reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 
the gross margins were influenced by a favorable shift in the revenue mix towards higher margin products and  to a lesser extent  improved expense coverage resulting from the impact of increased sales volumes on the segment s manufacturing and service infrastructure 
distribution segment revenues wilson markets pipe  valves  fittings and mill  safety and other maintenance products to energy and industrial markets  primarily through an extensive network of supply branches in the united states and canada 
the segment has the most significant north american revenue exposure of any of the company s operations with approximately percent of wilson s revenues generated in those markets 
moreover  approximately one third of wilson s revenues relate to sales to the downstream energy sector  including petrochemical plants and refineries  whose spending is largely influenced by the general state of the us economic environment 
additionally  certain customers in this sector utilize petroleum products as a base material and  accordingly  are adversely impacted by increases in crude oil and natural gas prices 
for the year ended december   wilson reported revenues totaling billion  an increase of percent from the prior year period 
two thirds of the revenue improvement was reported in wilson s upstream energy segment  attributable to higher north american activity levels  increased demand for tubular products and new contract awards 
wilson reported revenues of million for the year ended december   three percent above the prior year 
the year over year revenue increase was reported in the energy sector operations driven by the higher level of north american drilling and completion activity 
lower industrial sales volumes  primarily related to reduced maintenance and repair spending in the refining  petrochemical and power generation customer base impacted the reported revenue variance 
operating income operating income for the distribution segment was million  or percent of revenues  for the year ended december  excluding a charge recorded in the prior year  segment operating income increased million above the amount reported in  equating to incremental operating income of percent of revenues 
incremental operating income was influenced by year over year improvement reported in both the energy and industrial sector operations attributable to increased coverage of fixed sales and administrative costs and  to a lesser extent  the impact of favorable pricing driven by a competitive market for tubular products 
for the year ended december   operating income for the distribution segment declined million from the level  impacted by a million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of approximately million of this amount was an inventory related charge  while the remainder provided for estimated losses associated with the bankruptcy of a large industrial customer 
excluding this charge  distribution operating results increased million over the amount reported in  equating to incremental operating income of approximately two percent of revenues 
the incrementals were below those historically reported in the segment  impacted by the higher mix of project and export orders  which typically generate lower comparable margins

   cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax and minority interests  net income    versus consolidated revenues increased to billion for the year ended december   percent above the prior year period 
the majority of the year over year dollar variance was reported in the oilfield segment attributable to a combination of higher activity levels  increased market penetration and  to a lesser extent  improved product pricing 
on a geographic basis  two thirds of the revenue improvement was reported in the western hemisphere as the impact of higher land based drilling more than offset revenue reductions associated with activity declines experienced in the us offshore market 
improved business volumes in the eastern hemisphere market also contributed to the year over year revenue variance  reflecting the higher number of exploration and production projects and the impact of new contract awards 
gross profit totaled billion  or percent of revenues  one percentage point above the gross profit margins generated in the comparable prior year period 
although the margin expansion was largely driven by the impact of increased sales volumes on fixed manufacturing and service infrastructure costs  a shift in the business mix toward higher margin product offerings and improved product pricing also had a favorable effect 
on an absolute dollar basis  gross profit was million above the prior year period primarily reflecting the increased sales volumes in the oilfield operations 
operating expenses  consisting of selling  general and administrative expenses  increased million from the amount reported in the prior year 
the operating expense growth was impacted by a million litigation related charge recognized during to reflect an estimated loss provision  legal fees and other costs directly associated with a patent infringement case 
excluding the charge  operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues  decreased one percentage point from the prior year period 
improved fixed cost coverage in the sales and administrative functions accounted for the majority of the operating expense percentage decline 
the majority of the absolute dollar increase was attributable to variable related costs associated with the improved business volumes  including investment in personnel and infrastructure to support the expanding business operations 
to a lesser extent  increased employee profit sharing amounts directly attributable to the reported profitability levels  increased medical and casualty insurance program costs and legal fees associated with defending patent infringement lawsuits also contributed to the year over year operating expense growth 
net interest expense  which represents interest expense less interest income  totaled million in net interest expense decreased million from the prior year reflecting lower average debt levels between the periods 
the effective tax rate approximated percent  which was comparable to the level reported in the prior year  but below the us statutory rate 
the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate due to the impact of m i swaco s us partnership earnings for which the minority partner is directly responsible for its related income taxes

gross profit was billion  percent above the prior year period 
the increase in gross profit reflects higher sales volumes associated with the increased worldwide activity levels 
gross profit margins for the year were percent of revenues  one percentage point above the gross profit margins reported in the prior year 
the gross margin improvement was primarily impacted by an increased proportion of oilfield segment sales  which traditionally generate higher gross profit margins than the distribution segment 
to a lesser extent  a favorable shift in the product mix towards higher margin products  including drill bits and premium drilling fluids  contributed to the margin expansion 
operating expenses  consisting of selling  general and administrative expenses  increased million from the amount reported in the majority of the year to year increase was attributable to higher variable costs directly associated with the improved business volumes  as well as increased investment in people and infrastructure to support the expanding base business 
to a lesser extent  the operating expense variance was impacted by incremental expenses associated with acquired operations 
as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses were comparable with the prior year 
net interest expense  which represents interest expense less interest income  equaled million in net interest expense was relatively consistent with the prior year amount as average debt levels were comparable between the periods 
the effective tax rate approximated percent  which was above the percent effective rate reported in the prior year  but below the us statutory rate 
the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate due to the impact of m i swaco s us partnership earnings for which the minority partner is directly responsible for its related income taxes 
the company properly consolidates the pre tax income related to the minority partner s share of us partnership earnings but excludes the related tax provision 
the effective tax rate increased one percentage point from the prior year due to a shift in the geographic mix of pre tax income toward higher rate jurisdictions and  to a lesser extent  a lower proportion of m i swaco s us partnership earnings 
minority interests reflect the portion of the results of majority owned operations which are applicable to the minority interest partners 
minority interests totaled million in  a million increase from the prior year

in  cash flows used in investing activities totaled million  consisting of amounts required to fund capital expenditures and  to a lesser extent  acquisitions 
the company invested million in property  plant and equipment  net of cash proceeds arising from certain asset disposals 
acquisition funding  which primarily related to the purchase of certain operating assets from canfish services and the specialty chemical assets of fortum oil and gas oy  resulted in cash outflows of million in projected net capital expenditures for are expected to approximate million  as higher drilling activity and an expanding business base impact the level of investment in manufacturing and rental tool equipment 
capital spending in is expected to primarily consist of spending for routine additions of property and equipment to support the company s operations and maintenance of the company s capital equipment base 
cash flows used in financing activities totaled million in operating cash flow was sufficient to fund investing activities  however amounts required to finance repurchases under the company s share buyback program resulted in incremental borrowings under existing credit facilities 
the company s primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
cash flow generated by operations is primarily influenced by the level of worldwide drilling activity  which affects profitability levels and working capital requirements 
capacity under revolving credit agreements is also available  if necessary  to fund operating or investing activities 
as of december   the company had million of capacity available under its u 
s revolving credit facilities for future operating or investing needs

the potential transaction is structured as a sale of shares of wilson in exchange for additional shares of ce franklin 
accordingly  the transaction would not be expected to have an impact on the company s liquidity before certain stock sale restrictions lapse  which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of in the event the transaction is ultimately consummated  no material book gain or loss is expected to be realized on the sale 
the company  however  has agreed to fund certain of ce franklin s transaction related costs  primarily professional fees  which are expected to be immaterial 
and  depending on the final terms of the transaction  the company may be required to record a tax provision on the sale which could be material in relation to the quarterly tax provision  negatively impacting the recorded provision and effective tax rate in the period the transaction is consummated 
the company has not engaged in off balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities  and the consolidation of the company s minority ownership positions would not result in an increase in reported leverage ratios 
the company has no contractual arrangements in place that could result in the issuance of additional shares of the company s common stock at a future date other than the company s stock option program  which is discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  long term incentive compensation 
the company believes that it has sufficient existing manufacturing capacity to meet current demand for its products and services 
additionally  although inflation has not had a material effect on the company in the three most recent fiscal years  the company has experienced increases in freight costs  steel and other commodity prices during these costs  however  do not have a significant influence on the company s overall cost structure and the company has generally been able to offset most of these costs through productivity gains and price increases

management  however  does not expect any amounts to be drawn on this instrument 
the company has also provided loan guarantees related to certain joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
as the net assets and cash flows of these entities are available to satisfy obligations as they become due  management believes the likelihood is remote that the company will be required to perform under these guarantees 
the company s estimated maximum exposure under these loan guarantees approximated million as of december insurance the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations 
the company has elected to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under its insurance programs

in august  the company was added as a defendant in a first amended petition filed in the th judicial district court  parish of lafayette  louisiana entitled rose dove egle v 
john m 
egle  et al

other the company is a defendant in various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
environmental the company routinely establishes and reviews the adequacy of reserves for estimated future environmental clean up costs for properties currently or previously operated by the company 
in connection with most business acquisitions  the company obtains contractual indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
these indemnifications generally provide for the reimbursement of environmental clean up costs incurred by the company for events occurring or circumstances existing prior to the purchase date  whether the event or circumstance was known or unknown at that time 
a substantial portion of the company s total environmental exposure is associated with its m i swaco operations  which are subject to various indemnifications from former owners 
as of december   the company s environmental reserve totaled million 
this amount reflects the future undiscounted estimated exposure related to identified properties  without regard to indemnifications from former owners 
while actual future environmental costs may differ from estimated liabilities recorded at december   the company does not believe that these differences will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations  subject to the indemnifications in place 
during  the company took legal action against m i swaco s former owners to clarify certain contractual provisions of the environmental indemnification upon which approximately million of remediation costs properly incurred under the indemnification remains unpaid 
this matter is expected to go to trial during the second quarter of in the event that i m i swaco s former owners and other parties to indemnification agreements with the company do not fulfill their obligations  and ii costs incurred to remediate the identified properties reach estimated maximum exposure limits  the company would be required to record an additional charge of up to million  impacting earnings and cash flows in future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company extends credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
management regularly reviews outstanding receivables and provides for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  management makes judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
inventory reserves 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers around the world 
on a routine basis  the company uses judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by technological innovations  market activity levels and the physical condition of products 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
goodwill 
the company has acquired a number of operations during the past decade  which has resulted in the recording of a material amount of goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment evaluation  which is largely influenced by future cash flow projections 
estimating future cash flows of the company s operations requires management to make judgments about future operating results and working capital requirements 
although the majority of the goodwill relates to the company s oilfield operations  million of goodwill relates to distribution transactions 
changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors which negatively impact the fair value of the operations would influence the evaluation and may result in the determination that a portion of the goodwill is impaired when the annual analysis is performed 
self insurance 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations 
the company retains a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under self insurance programs 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported claims and provides for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
in certain cases  management has established reserves to reduce deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
environmental obligations 
the company records liabilities for environmental obligations when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
management s estimates are based on currently enacted laws and regulations 
as more information becomes available or environmental laws and regulations change  such liabilities may be required to be adjusted 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  the company generally obtains indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their obligations  adjustments of recorded amounts may be required

under the modified prospective method  compensation cost related to all unvested stock options is recognized beginning with the effective date  however  the limited modified retrospective method permits restatement of prior periods assuming adoption of sfas no r as of january  although the company continues to evaluate the standard and related transition matters  based on equity awards granted to employees through december  and those expected to be granted during the second quarter of  share based compensation expense on a full year basis is expected to total approximately million  net of tax 
from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb which are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date

item a 
qualitative and quantitative market risk disclosures the company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  for additional discussion of hedging instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is managed through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and by entering into interest rate contracts  from time to time  on a portion of its long term borrowings 
the company had no interest rate contracts outstanding as of december  and at december   percent of the company s long term debt carried a variable interest rate 
management believes that significant interest rate changes will not have a material near term impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
the company s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is managed primarily through the use of forward exchange contracts 
these contracts increase or decrease in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of the underlying transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all currency contracts are components of the company s hedging program and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
the terms of these contracts generally do not exceed two years 
as of december   the notional amount of fair value hedge contracts outstanding was million  approximating the fair value of these contracts 
as of december   the notional amounts of fair value hedge contracts and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding were million and million  respectively  and the fair value exceeded the notional amount of these contracts by million 
in some areas  where hedging is not cost effective  the company addresses foreign currency exposure utilizing working capital management 
the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
the company s var computations are based on the historical price movements in various currencies a historical simulation during the year 
the model includes all of the company s foreign exchange derivative contracts 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of currency sensitive instruments  calculated using the var model  was not material to the company s financial position or results of operations
