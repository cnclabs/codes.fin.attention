item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments  exploration and production e p and refining and marketing r m 
the e p segment explores for  produces and sells crude oil and natural gas 
the r m segment manufactures  purchases  trades and markets refined petroleum and other energy products 
the corporation s goal for the e p segment is to grow reserves and production profitably with its portfolio of development projects and to deliver exploration success 
during and  the corporation reshaped its e p asset portfolio by selling higher cost properties predominantly in the shallow water gulf of mexico and the north sea for proceeds of million 
exchanging interests in mature producing assets for increased interests in development stage assets in the joint development area of malaysia and thailand and deepwater gulf of mexico 
participating in two oil discoveries in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
the asset sales and exchanges contributed significantly to the decline in production from  barrels of oil equivalent per day in to  barrels of oil equivalent per day in in  the corporation forecasts that crude oil and natural gas production will average  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
in  the corporation continued to make progress in its development projects that are expected to provide significant new production in and  which will more than offset natural declines in existing fields 
milestones accomplished on our development projects in were in april  the llano field in the deepwater gulf of mexico commenced production 
the corporation has a interest in this field and net production at year end is averaging approximately  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
in august  the government of equatorial guinea approved the development plan for the corporation s northern block g fields  which is now called the okume complex 
the corporation anticipates first production in in august  the second phase of the project to redevelop the gassi el agreb fields in algeria was approved  resulting in an increased investment commitment of approximately million 
this change reflects the corporation s success in the area 
since  the corporation has increased gross production from  barrels of oil equivalent per day to  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
in december  the corporation negotiated additional gas sales from block a in the malaysia thailand joint development area 
the corporation anticipates that this agreement will allow it to double proved reserves on the field over the next several years and contribute to future production growth 
first sales of natural gas from this block under the original gas sales agreement began in in december  the corporation approved the ujung pangkah development in indonesia 
gas sales should commence by early in the united kingdom  first production from the clair field commenced in and production from the atlantic and cromarty gas fields is expected to commence in combined net production from these three fields is anticipated to be at an annualized rate of  barrels of oil equivalent per day when all three fields are onstream in during  the corporation drilled successful appraisal wells at the shenzi prospect in the deepwater gulf of mexico  at the phu horm field onshore thailand  and at ujung pangkah 
in december  the corporation announced a natural gas discovery at the belud prospect offshore malaysia 
the corporation has an inventory of exploration prospects and will drill several high impact wells in the corporation has two exploration wells currently drilling in the gulf of mexico that will have estimated pre tax capitalized drilling costs of approximately to million upon completion 
if either or both of these wells are unsuccessful  after tax first quarter earnings would be reduced by up to million 

table of contents proved reserves increased to billion barrels of oil equivalent at year end from billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of the corporation s reserves included in this form k are calculated by an independent third party reserve engineer 
see further discussion of management s governance over the estimation of oil and gas reserves in the supplementary oil and gas data on page the strategic goals for r m are to maximize returns from existing assets and generate free cash flow 
the corporation may grow the retail and energy marketing businesses opportunistically 
during and  the r m segment s results improved significantly  primarily due to higher refining margins 
the hovensa and port reading refineries operated near maximum capacity for most of the year  enabling them to take full advantage of the strong margins 
hovensa s capacity to process lower cost heavy crude oil enhanced profitability in  due to a significant price differential between light and heavy crude oil 
in  the corporation received a cash distribution of million from hovensa 
the hovensa fluid catalytic cracking unit was shutdown for approximately days of planned maintenance in the first quarter of planned maintenance of the fluid catalytic cracking unit at the port reading facility is underway and expected to last for approximately days 
the corporation s liquidity and financial position have improved significantly since year end at december   the corporation s debt was billion and its debt to capitalization ratio was 
as of december   the corporation s debt has been reduced to billion and the debt to capitalization ratio was 
aggregate debt maturities through are million 
the corporation s cash balance at december  was million 
capital expenditures were billion in  billion in and billion in capital expenditures for are forecast to be billion  with billion dedicated to the exploration and production segment

table of contents in the discussion that follows  the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis 
management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings 
management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings  since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount 
after tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts 
the following items  on an after tax basis  are included in income from continuing operations for the years  and millions of dollars net gains from asset sales income tax adjustments corporate insurance accrual lifo inventory liquidation accrued severance and office costs premiums on bond repurchases asset impairments reduction in carrying value of refining and marketing intangible assets and severance the items in the table above are explained on pages through the pre tax amounts are shown on pages  and comparison of results exploration and production after considering the exploration and production items in the preceding table  the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices  production volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses  as discussed below 
selling prices higher average selling prices of crude oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas increased exploration and production revenues from continuing operations by approximately million in compared with in  the change in average selling prices increased revenues by approximately million compared with the corporation s average selling prices from continuing operations  including the effects of hedging  were as follows crude oil per barrel united states foreign natural gas liquids per barrel united states foreign natural gas per mcf united states foreign

the remaining million deferred loss is realized and relates to closed hedge positions 
the deferred realized loss will be recognized in earnings as the underlying barrels are sold in the corporation has open hedge positions equal to of its estimated worldwide crude oil production for the average price per barrel for open united states crude oil hedges is 
the average price for open foreign crude oil hedges is 
approximately of the corporation s hedges are wti related and the remainder are brent 
in addition to the gains or losses on these open hedge positions  approximately million of the million deferred realized loss will reduce first quarter earnings and the remaining deferred realized loss will be recognized in earnings over the balance of the year 
the corporation also has approximately  barrels per day of brent related production hedged from to the average price of these hedge positions is per barrel 
there were no natural gas hedges outstanding at december  production and sales volumes the corporation s crude oil and natural gas production  on a barrel of oil equivalent basis  was  barrels per day in   barrels per day in and  barrels per day in approximately of the production declines in and resulted from sales and exchanges of oil and gas producing properties 
the remainder resulted principally from natural decline  and in compared with  disappointing results from fields acquired in the united states in and reduced production from the ceiba field in equatorial guinea 
the corporation anticipates that its production  including anticipated production from libya  will be approximately  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
see page for the current status of the discussions on the corporation s return to libya 
the corporation s net daily worldwide production was as follows crude oil thousands of barrels per day united states foreign total natural gas liquids thousands of barrels per day united states foreign total natural gas thousands of mcf per day united states foreign total barrels of oil equivalent thousands of barrels per day barrels of oil equivalent production included above related to discontinued operations reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content six mcf equals one barrel 

table of contents decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue from continuing operations of approximately million in compared with and lower revenue of approximately million in compared with operating costs and exploration expenses operating costs and exploration expenses from continuing operations decreased by approximately million in compared with and increased by million in compared with depreciation  depletion and amortization charges were lower in and principally reflecting decreased production volumes 
exploration expenses were lower in as a result of lower dry hole costs 
exploration expenses were higher in  reflecting increased activity in the united states and equatorial guinea  as well as additional lease cost amortization 
production expenses increased in and primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar which increased costs incurred in foreign currencies 
in addition  higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas increased the costs of production taxes  transportation  maintenance and fuel 
unit costs per barrel totaled in  in and in unit cost per barrel includes production expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization  exploration expense and administrative costs 
other after tax foreign currency gains amounted to million million before income taxes in  compared with a loss of million million before income taxes in and income of million million before income taxes in excluding items in the following table  the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in was 
this includes income taxes paid in jurisdictions with rates in excess of the united states statutory rate  such as the united kingdom and norway 
it also reflects an income tax deduction for the corporation s hedging results at the us statutory rate 
each of these factors increases the corporation s overall exploration and production effective income tax rate 
the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in is expected to be in the range of to 
assuming agreements are finalized and the corporation returns to libya  the exploration and production effective income tax rate will exceed the range above

exploration and production earnings included after tax asset impairments of million  million of which related to the ceiba field in equatorial guinea 
the pre tax amount of the ceiba field impairment was million 
the charge resulted from a reduction in the estimated total field reserves that will ultimately be produced from the field  as well as higher anticipated development costs needed to produce the remaining reserves at lower production rates over a longer period 
the reduction in estimated recoverable reserves was attributable to disappointing year end drilling results on the western flank of the field 
the reduction in probable reserves and higher estimated future development costs resulted in an asset impairment because projected cash flows were less than the book value of the field  which includes allocated purchase price from the triton acquisition 
the corporation also recorded an after tax impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of oil and gas properties located primarily in the main pass breton sound area of the gulf of mexico 
most of these properties were obtained in the llog acquisition and consisted of producing oil and gas fields with proved and probable reserves and exploration acreage 
this charge principally reflects reduced reserve estimates on these fields resulting from unfavorable production performance 
the fair values of producing properties were determined by using discounted cash flows 
exploration properties were evaluated by using results of drilling and production data from nearby fields and seismic data for these and other properties in the area 
during  the united kingdom government enacted a supplementary tax on profits from oil and gas production 
a one time charge of million was recorded to increase the existing united kingdom deferred tax liability on the balance sheet 
the gain on asset sales in reflected the disposal of oil and gas producing properties in the united states  united kingdom and azerbaijan  and the corporation s energy marketing business in the united kingdom

table of contents foreign operations the corporation conducts exploration and production activities in many foreign countries  including the united kingdom  norway  denmark  gabon  indonesia  thailand  azerbaijan  algeria  malaysia and equatorial guinea 
therefore  the corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations 
these exposures include political risk including tax law changes and currency risk

critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement 
the accounting methods used can affect net income  stockholders equity and various financial statement ratios 
however  the corporation s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 
accounting for exploration and development costs oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method 
costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage  including lease bonuses  brokers fees and other related costs  are capitalized 
annual lease rentals  exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred 
costs of drilling and equipping productive wells  including development dry holes  and related production facilities are capitalized 
the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found 
in an area requiring a major capital expenditure before production can begin  an exploration well is carried as an asset if sufficient reserves are discovered to justify its completion as a production well  and additional exploration drilling is underway or firmly planned 
the corporation does not capitalize the cost of other exploratory wells for more than one year unless proved reserves are found 
crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities 
the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations  undeveloped leasehold impairments and the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties  wells and equipment 
reductions in reserve estimates may result in the need for increased depreciation or impairments of proved properties and related assets 
the corporation s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with sec regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the financial accounting standards board 
for reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible  government approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost  senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project 
the corporation s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves 
the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties 
the corporation s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells  performance reviews  new technical data and other studies 
to provide consistency throughout the corporation  standard reserve estimation guidelines  definitions  reporting reviews and approval practices are used 
the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates 
the oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the supplementary oil and gas data in accordance with fas no 
are determined independently by the consulting firm of degolyer and macnaughton d m and are consistent with internal estimates 
annually  the corporation provides d m with engineering  geological and geophysical data  actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve 
table of contents determination 
the corporation s and d m s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided 
senior management and the board of directors review the final reserve estimates issued by d m 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing 
the corporation reviews long lived assets  including oil and gas fields  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered 
long lived assets are tested at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates  the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded 
the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 
in the case of oil and gas fields  the present value of future net cash flows is based on management s best estimate of future prices  which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices  applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved 
the projected production volumes represent reserves  including probable reserves  expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures 
the production volumes  prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information 
oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year 
the corporation s impairment tests of long lived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors  selling prices  operating and capital costs and the timing of future production  which are updated each time an impairment test is performed 
in  the corporation recorded impairments of the ceiba field and llog properties that were required primarily because of reduced estimates of oil and gas production volumes and  in the case of ceiba  anticipated additional development costs 
the impairment charges did not result from changes in the other factors 
the change in the estimated timing of production on the ceiba field did not significantly affect the undiscounted future cash flows  but did significantly reduce the fair value of the field determined by discounted cash flows 
the corporation could have additional impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced 
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments 
the corporation recorded million of goodwill in connection with the purchase of triton energy limited in factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill included the strategic value of expanding global operations to access new growth areas outside of the united states and the north sea  obtaining critical mass in africa and southeast asia  and synergies  including cost savings  improved processes and portfolio high grading opportunities 
in accordance with fas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested for impairment annually 
fas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at a reporting unit level 
the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 
a component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
however  two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics 
an operating segment shall be deemed a reporting unit if all of its components are economically similar 
within the corporation s exploration and production operating segment there are currently two components americas and west africa and europe  north africa and asia 
each component has a manager who reports to the segment manager 
the corporation has determined the components have similar economic characteristics and  therefore  has aggregated the components into a single reporting unit the exploration and production operating segment 
as a result  goodwill has been assigned to the exploration and production operating segment 
if the corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such 
table of contents that there was more than one operating segment  or its components were no longer economically similar  goodwill would be assigned to two or more reporting units 
the goodwill would be allocated to any new reporting units using a relative fair value approach in accordance with fas no 
goodwill impairment testing for lower level reporting units could result in the recognition of an impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation 
the corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of the exploration and production segment as a whole and it evaluated the following characteristics in determining that the components are economically similar the corporation operates its exploration and production segment as a single  global business 
each component produces oil and gas 
the exploration and production processes are similar in each component 
the methods used by each component to market and distribute oil and gas are similar 
customers of each component are similar 
the components share resources and are supported by a worldwide exploration team and a shared services organization 
the corporation s fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments  the expected risked present value of exploration assets  and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings  access to new business opportunities  enterprise control  improved processes and increased market share 
the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 
the determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves  future prices  timing of future net cash flows and market premiums 
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 
in addition  changes in management structure or sales or dispositions of a portion of the exploration and production segment may result in goodwill impairment 
because there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing  there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the million of goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment 
in  the corporation recognized asset impairments because reduced estimates of oil and gas production volumes caused the expected undiscounted cash flows of the assets to be lower than the asset carrying amounts 
no impairment of goodwill existed because the fair value of the overall exploration and production operating segment continued to exceed its recorded book value 
segments the corporation has two operating segments  exploration and production  and refining and marketing 
management has determined that these are its operating segments because  in accordance with fas no 
 these are the segments of the corporation i that engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred  ii whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the corporation s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and iii for which discrete financial information is available 
the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the corporation  is the chief operating decision maker codm as defined in fas no 
 because he is responsible for performing the functions within the corporation of allocating resources to  and assessing the performance of  the corporation s operating segments 
the codm uses only the operating results of each segment as a whole to make decisions about resources to be allocated to each segment and to assess the segment performance 
the codm manages each segment globally and does not regularly review the operating results of any component eg  geographic area or asset within each 
table of contents segment or any such information by geographical location  oil and gas property or project  subsidiary or division  to make decisions about resources to be allocated or to assess performance 
while the codm does review and approve initial corporate funding for a new project using information about the project  he does not review subsequent operating results by project after the initial funding 
each operating segment has one manager 
the segment managers are responsible for allocating resources within the segments  reviewing financial results of components within the segments  and assessing the performance of the components 
the codm evaluates the performance of the segment managers based on performance metrics related to each manager s operating segment as a whole 
the board of directors of the corporation does not receive more detailed information than that used by the codm to operate and manage the corporation 
hedging the corporation may use futures  forwards  options and swaps  individually or in combination  to reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil  natural gas and refined product selling prices 
related hedge gains or losses are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices 
generally  these derivatives are designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges  and the changes in fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these transactions meet the requirements for hedge accounting  including correlation 
the corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the time the hedged transactions are recognized 
the ineffective portion of hedges is included in current earnings 
the corporation s remaining derivatives  including foreign currency contracts  are not designated as hedges and the change in fair value is included in income currently 
at december   the corporation has million of deferred exploration and production hedging losses  after income taxes  included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions  including the united states  and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses 
additionally  the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities 
regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized 
if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will be realized 
in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets  the corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences  available carryforward periods for net operating losses  estimates of future taxable income  the availability of tax planning strategies  the existence of appreciated assets and other factors 
estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation s internal business forecasts 
environment  health and safety the corporation has implemented a values based  socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment  health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities 
the strategy is supported by the corporation s environment  health  safety and social responsibility policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation s workforce  customers and local communities 
the corporation s management systems are based on international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency  adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs performance 
improved performance may increase the corporation s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets  reputation and license to operate 
while overall governance is the responsibility of senior management  the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance  audit facilities  train employees and to generally meet corporate ehs goals 
the port reading refining facility and the hovensa refinery manufacture conventional and reformulated gasolines that are cleaner burning than that required under current us regulations 
the production of motor and other fuels in the united states and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures to reduce sulfur content in recent years 
in  new regulations went into effect that significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional rules to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel will go into effect in fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional large capital expenditures 

table of contents the corporation and hovensa continue to evaluate options to determine the most cost effective compliance strategies for known fuel regulations 
estimated capital expenditures necessary to comply with low sulfur gasoline requirements at port reading are approximately million over the next two years 
capital expenditures to comply with low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at hovensa are presently expected to be approximately million in total  million of which has already been spent 
remaining capital expenditures are projected to be million over the next two years 
hovensa plans to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
if it becomes necessary to finance a portion of the capital expenditures  hovensa has million of available revolving credit capacity 
federal legislation to restrict or ban the use of mtbe  a gasoline oxygenate  and to require the use of renewable fuels was considered by the united states congress in and will likely be reconsidered in the corporation and hovensa both manufacture and use mtbe  where permitted  to meet the federal requirement for oxygen in reformulated gasoline 
in states within the corporation s marketing area where mtbe bans have been enacted  such as connecticut and new york  the corporation markets reformulated gasoline without oxygenates and ethanol is added to the gasoline downstream from the refineries to meet regulatory requirements 
if congress bans mtbe nationally or if additional state bans take effect  or if an obligation to use ethanol or other renewable fuels is imposed  the effect on the corporation and hovensa could be significant 
whether the effect is significant will depend on several factors  including the extent and timing of any such bans of mtbe or obligations to use ethanol  requirements for maintenance of certain air emission reductions if mtbe is banned  the cost and availability of alternative oxygenates or credits and whether the minimum oxygen content standard for reformulated gasoline remains in effect 
the corporation will continue to review various options to market and produce reformulated gasolines if additional mtbe bans take effect 
as described in item legal proceedings in  the corporation and hovensa began discussions with the us epa regarding the epa s petroleum refining initiative pri 
the pri is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all us refineries 
since  epa has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over of the nation s refining capacity in states and negotiations continue with many refiners 
depending on the outcome of these discussions  the corporation and hovensa may experience increased capital and operating expenses related to air emissions controls 
the pri allows for controls to be phased in over several years 
the corporation recognizes the worldwide concern about the environmental and social impact of air emissions 
on a global scale  climate change is an issue that has prompted much public debate and has a potential impact on future economic growth and development 
the corporation has undertaken a program to assess  monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide and methane 
the challenges associated with this program may be significant  not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility  but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the corporation s entire greenhouse gas inventory 
the corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions 
sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations  terminals  onshore exploration and production facilities  refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and  although not currently significant  superfund sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party 
the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
at year end  the corporation s reserve for its estimated environmental liability was approximately million 
the corporation does not discount its environmental liability 
the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites 
remediation spending was million in and and million in capital expenditures for facilities  primarily to comply with federal  state and local environmental standards  were million in  million in and million in 
table of contents forward looking information certain sections of management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  including references to the corporation s future results of operations and financial position  liquidity and capital resources  capital expenditures  oil and gas production  tax rates  debt repayment  hedging  derivative  market risk and environmental disclosures  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information 
forward looking disclosures are based on the corporation s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future 
actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions  government actions and other factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of its business  the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil  natural gas  refined products and electricity  as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values 
in the disclosures that follow  these operations are referred to as non trading activities 
the corporation also has trading operations  principally through a voting interest in a trading partnership 
these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil  natural gas and refined products 
the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed 
controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy  which the corporation s senior management has approved 
controls include volumetric  term and value at risk limits 
in addition  the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities 
risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management 
the corporation s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models 
these controls apply to all of the corporation s non trading and trading activities  including the consolidated trading partnership 
the corporation s treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs 
instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts  foreign exchange forward contracts  futures  swaps  options and energy commodity linked securities in its non trading and trading activities 
these contracts are widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms 
the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them forward commodity contracts the forward purchase and sale of commodities is performed as part of the corporation s normal activities 
at title date  the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity 
forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and sale contracts under fas no 
are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures 
forward foreign exchange contracts forward contracts include forward purchase contracts for both the british pound sterling and the danish kroner 
these foreign currency contracts commit the corporation to purchase a fixed amount of pound sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange rate on a certain date 
futures the corporation uses exchange traded futures contracts on a number of different underlying energy commodities 
these contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and are subject to exchange position limits 
swaps the corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities 
cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract 
options options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods 
as a seller of options  the corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option 
as a purchaser of options  the corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities 

table of contents energy commodity linked securities securities where the price is linked to the price of an underlying energy commodity 
these securities may be issued by a company or government 
quantitative measures the corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non trading activities 
the value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a confidence level 
the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options 
the potential change in fair value based on commodity price risk is presented in the non trading and trading sections below 
for foreign exchange rate risk  the impact of a change in foreign exchange rates on the value of the corporation s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts is presented in the non trading section 
similarly  the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the corporation s debt is also presented in the non trading section 
a change in foreign exchange rates and a change in the rate of interest over one year are considered reasonable possibilities for providing sensitivity disclosures 
non trading the corporation s non trading activities include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production 
futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the corporation s future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the corporation s selling prices 
as of december  the corporation has open hedge positions equal to of its estimated worldwide crude oil production 
the average price for west texas intermediate crude oil wti related open hedge positions is 
the average price for brent crude oil related open hedge positions is 
approximately of the corporation s hedges is wti related and the remainder is brent 
in addition  the corporation has approximately  barrels per day of brent related crude oil production hedged from through at an average price of per barrel 
there were no hedges of natural gas production at year end 
as market conditions change  the corporation may adjust its hedge percentages 
because the selling price of crude oil has increased during  accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december  includes after tax deferred losses of million million of realized losses and million of unrealized losses related to crude oil contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales 
realized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income represent losses on closed contracts that are deferred until the underlying barrels are sold 
in addition to the impact of the open hedge positions described above  approximately million of the realized losses will reduce earnings in the first quarter of and the remainder will reduce earnings during the balance of the pre tax amount of all deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet 
the corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products  natural gas and electricity 
the corporation uses futures and swaps to fix the purchase prices of commodities to be sold under fixed price sales contracts 
the following table summarizes the value at risk results of commodity related derivatives that are settled in cash and used in non trading activities 
the results may vary from time to time as hedge levels change 
non trading activities millions of dollars at december average for the year high during the year low during the year at december average for the year high during the year low during the year 
table of contents the increase in the value at risk in principally reflects additional hedge positions on brent related production for the years through the corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward purchase contracts for both the british pound sterling and the danish kroner 
at december   the corporation has million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in million at december  
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts recorded as assets was million at december  million at december  
the change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a change in exchange rates is estimated to be million at december  million at december  
at december   the interest rate on substantially all of the corporation s debt was fixed and there were no interest rate swaps 
the corporation s outstanding debt of  million has a fair value of  million at december  debt of  million at december  had a fair value of  million 
a change in the rate of interest would change the fair value of debt by approximately million at december  and by approximately million at december  trading the trading partnership in which the corporation has a voting interest trades energy commodities and derivatives 
the accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the corporation 
the corporation also takes trading positions for its own account 
these strategies include proprietary position management and trading to enhance the potential return on assets
