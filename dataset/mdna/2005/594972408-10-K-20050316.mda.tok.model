our products can be deployed on company intranets to provide employees with information to make better  more cost effective business and management decisions 
leading companies and government organizations worldwide have chosen microstrategy as their enterprise business intelligence standard 
by integrating information from across the enterprise  solutions built on the microstrategy platform are designed to give analysts  managers and executives the critical insight they need to make better business and management decisions and to optimize their operations 
with extranet deployments  enterprises can use microstrategy to build stronger relationships by linking customers and suppliers via the internet 
microstrategy facilitates customer success with a comprehensive offering of consulting  education  technical support and technical advisory services for our customers and strategic partners 
industry background business intelligence software offers decision makers the opportunity to ask and answer questions about their use of data that has been captured but not yet fully exploited 
four key business needs have driven demand for business intelligence tools increased user access and scalability in the past  dissemination of information has been limited to a few power users or analysts 
now a wide range of information customers from customer service representatives to the ceo and from customers to suppliers demand the insight that business intelligence can provide 
the wide acceptance of the internet as an information source has also fueled demand for enterprise data to be accessible over the web to tens of thousands of users across the enterprise 
increased data scalability increasing information generation  and in particular  the need to capture electronically and store every business transaction  has made terabyte size data warehouses commonplace 
terabyte size data warehouses store one trillion bytes of data or more and are among the largest databases in the world 
since transaction level information is now routinely captured  organizations struggle to make productive use of such massive data stores 
organizations need to view data within the operational context of the data making even the most detailed information meaningful and comprehensive to business users 
as a result  users want to be able to discover easily trends hidden in these very large databases  and verify these trends by reviewing the underlying transaction detail 
improved supply efficiency supplier transactions become more efficient with direct access to inventory and other related data 
for true vendor managed inventory and collaborative commerce systems  vendors need to have access to key information about how their products are performing 
table of contents against business metrics 
for example  vendors should be able to see how their products are selling in each geographic region so as not to over ship products that are slow moving or under ship products that are selling quickly 
by opening vendor performance information to the vendors themselves  buyers and sellers of goods and services become partners in the quest to optimize sales  margin and inventory 
improved distribution efficiency business partners collaborate more effectively with access to shared data 
by granting partners access to information such as the manufacturing pipeline and build schedule  partners can be more effective at satisfying demands of end customers and setting expectations 
furthermore  opening invoice and purchase order information to partners can enable them to reduce the overhead associated with channel management  resulting in cost savings and time efficiencies 
for example  notifying channel sales partners of changes in the manufacturing schedule allows them to reset end customer expectations or to increase selling activity 
the emergence and widespread acceptance of the internet as a medium of communication and commerce have changed the way businesses interact with each other and their customers by allowing businesses to establish new revenue streams  create new distribution channels and reduce costs 
simultaneously  the amount of corporate information stored in databases continues to grow exponentially  and companies are giving an increasing number of employees  customers and partners access to their information 
business intelligence tools are one of the gateways to this information 
for example  companies are using internet based systems to facilitate business operations  including sales automation  supply chain management  marketing  customer service and human resource management 
consumers are also becoming increasingly sophisticated in their use of the internet  relying on the internet not only to make online purchases  but to perform price comparisons  analyze recommendations from like minded individuals  educate themselves about relevant products and offerings and enter into transactions that were once conducted face to face or via the telephone 
the integration of the internet into business processes and increased consumer sophistication create opportunities for companies to use business intelligence applications as part of a more dynamic business model 
factors driving demand for these applications include increased electronic capture of transaction  operational and customer information 
the rapid growth in the electronic capture of business information and the increased availability of related profile data on the parties or products involved in each transaction are providing businesses with a rich data foundation for performing various analyses and making decisions 
powerful data analysis and mining tools are required to sift through massive amounts of data to uncover information regarding customer interactions  trends  patterns and exceptions  in turn enabling organizations to provide superior service and products to customers 
need to create a personalized  one to one customer and or supplier experience while maintaining privacy 
many companies are initiating strategies that establish personalized relationships with each customer and or supplier based on individual needs and preferences  and earn their loyalty by providing superior service  security and convenience 
in order to successfully acquire  retain and upgrade customers  organizations need to understand their profiles  their transaction history  their past responses to marketing campaigns  and their interactions with customer service 
retrieving information from widely dispersed and complex data sources and providing a holistic view of the customer can be challenging 
at the same time  while businesses have the opportunity to collect a variety of information that could improve targeting  customers are increasingly concerned about the potential for loss or abuse of their privacy 
need to integrate online and traditional operations 
while there are substantial benefits to conducting business electronically  companies need to ensure that their online operations work in combination with their traditional operations 
companies are seeking to ensure that an order placed online can be reliably fulfilled according to the expectations of the customer and to develop and maintain consistent interactions with customers across different channels 
maintaining the integrity of  and enhancing  the customer experience are crucial to fostering customer loyalty and supply chain relationships 

table of contents increased openness of business intelligence applications to customers  suppliers and partners 
business intelligence systems are no longer confined to the corporation 
today  companies are extending their business intelligence insight to suppliers  channel partners and customers via extranets 
business partners can have up to the minute access to sales histories  inventory status and billing information through their web browsers 
emergence of wireless internet and voice technologies 
information can be more valuable if there is untethered  ubiquitous access to the information 
an integrated platform reduces the need to rely on multiple vendors for these products and services 
this development is expected to generate new business opportunities for companies by providing an additional channel for existing services and creating opportunities to provide new services that can be delivered to any place and at any time to anyone that has access to a wireless device

competition the market for business intelligence software is intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
in addition  many companies in these markets are offering  or may soon offer  products and services that may compete with microstrategy products 
microstrategy faces competitors in several broad categories  including business intelligence software  analytical processes  query and web based reporting tools  and report delivery 
our competitors that are primarily focused on business intelligence products include  actuate  business objects  cognos  hyperion solutions  information builders  panorama  arcplan  proclarity  outlooksoft corporation  and the sas institute 
we also compete with large software corporations  including suppliers of enterprise resource planning software that provide one or more capabilities competitive with our products  including ibm  microsoft  oracle  sap ag and siebel systems 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business intelligence industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
increased competition may lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and the failure to meet the competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others 
by doing so  they may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers 
our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors 
these relationships may limit our ability to sell our products through specific distribution channels 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
these developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to maintain technical support revenues from our installed customer base 
employees as of december   we had a total of employees  of whom were based in the united states and were based internationally 
of the total of employees  were engaged in sales and marketing  in research and development  in technical support  consulting and education services  and in finance  administration and corporate operations 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good 
we believe that effective recruiting  education and nurturing of human resources are critical to our success and have traditionally made investments in these areas in order to differentiate ourselves from our competition  increase employee loyalty and create a culture conducive to creativity  cooperation and continuous improvement 
all newly hired professionals complete a professional orientation course that ranges from one day to four weeks long  presented by microstrategy university  our in house education function 
the curriculum consists of lectures  problem sets and independent and group projects  covering data on our products  competitors and 
table of contents customers

critical accounting policies microstrategy s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
for a comprehensive discussion of our accounting policies  see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and judgments  particularly relating to revenue recognition  benefit or provision for income taxes  restructuring and impairment charges and litigation and contingencies  have a material impact on our financial statements  and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of the results of operations as discussed below 
in addition to evaluating estimates relating to the items discussed above  we also consider other estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  software development costs and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates is included below under risk factors 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
microstrategy s software revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
in the case of software arrangements that require significant production  modification or customization of software  we follow the guidance in sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we also follow the guidance provided by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab no 
 revenue recognition  which provide guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements filed with the sec 
we recognize revenue from sales of software licenses to end users or resellers upon persuasive evidence of an arrangement  as provided by agreements or contracts executed by both parties  delivery of the software and determination that collection of a fixed or determinable fee is reasonably assured 
when the fees for software 
table of contents upgrades and enhancements  technical support  consulting and education are bundled with the license fee  they are unbundled using our objective evidence of the fair value of the elements represented by our customary pricing for each element in separate transactions 
if such evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and there is no such evidence of fair value established for delivered elements  revenue is first allocated to the elements where evidence of fair value has been established and the residual amount is allocated to the delivered elements 
if evidence of fair value for any undelivered element of an arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered  subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in sop when a software license arrangement requires us to provide significant production  customization or modification of the software  or when the customer considers these services essential to the functionality of the software product  both the product license revenue and consulting services revenue are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under percentage of completion accounting  both product license and consulting services revenue are recognized as work progresses based upon labor hours incurred 
any expected losses on contracts in progress are expensed in the period in which the losses become probable and reasonably estimable 
contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method were immaterial for the years ended december   and if an arrangement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until we can objectively demonstrate that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria  or the acceptance period lapses  whichever occurs earlier 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver specified future products or upgrades  the revenue is recognized when the specified future product or upgrades are delivered  or when the obligation to deliver specified future products expires  whichever occurs earlier 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  then revenue is recognized on the subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
license revenue derived from sales to resellers or oem s who purchase our products for future resale is recognized upon sufficient evidence that the products have been sold to the ultimate end users provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
technical support revenue  included in product support and other services revenue  is derived from providing technical support and software updates and upgrades to customers 
technical support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which in most cases is one year 
revenue from consulting and education services is recognized as the services are performed 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are included in deferred revenue and advance payments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the application of sop  as amended  requires judgment  including a determination that collectibility is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed and determinable and whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
microstrategy s ability to enter into revenue generating transactions and recognize revenue in the future is subject to a number of business and economic risks discussed below under risk factors 
restructuring and impairment charges 
restructuring and impairment charges have been recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in determining the costs associated with real estate lease losses from exiting facilities  management was required to make judgments and estimates which significantly impacted the recorded amount of restructuring and impairment charges 
the real estate lease losses included estimates of sublease commission costs  sub tenant concession costs  sublease rental income and the expected length of time to sublease idle space 
final results 
table of contents could substantially differ from current estimates if we are unable to sublet the remaining vacant office space for the remaining periods under current real estate leases on the estimated terms 
as a result of restructuring plans adopted in  we have approximately  square feet of office space that we currently did not occupy 
as of december   all of the  square feet that we do not occupy had been subleased 
litigation and contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
we are involved in lawsuits with business objects  sa and business objects americas  inc relating to claims involving patent infringement and other intellectual property claims 
the outcome of this litigation is not presently determinable  and as such  we are currently unable to estimate the potential range of gain or loss  if any  relating to these actions 
accordingly  no provision for these matters has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additional information regarding these matters is included below under risk factors 
we are also involved in other legal proceedings through the normal course of business 
management believes that any unfavorable outcome related to these other proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of our accounts receivable 
in determining the collectibility of specific customer accounts  management is required to make judgments based on information known about each account 
software development costs 
we account for software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
specifies that software development costs incurred internally should be expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
once technological feasibility has been established  all software development costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established 
we consider technological feasibility to be achieved when a product design and working model of the software product have been completed 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
during the year ending december   we recorded a net million decrease in the valuation allowance related to changes in deferred tax assets and the reduction of valuation allowances on net operating loss carryforward tax assets and other deferred tax assets in the us and certain foreign subsidiaries 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
in determining net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of domestic and foreign profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
subsequent impairment assessments could result in future impairment charges 
any impairment charge would result in reductions in the carrying value of long lived assets and would reduce our operating results in the period in which the charge arose 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
apb no 
provides that compensation expense relative to a company s employee stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock options at the measurement date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r eliminates the intrinsic value method under apb no 
as an alternative method of accounting for stock based awards 
sfas no 
r also revises the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment liabilities  forfeitures and modifications of stock based awards and clarifies the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in several areas  including measuring fair value  classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods 
in addition  sfas no 
r amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid  which is included within operating cash flows 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r for the interim period beginning july   using one of three implementation alternatives specified under sfas no

restructuring and impairment charges 
during  we adopted restructuring plans which included a strategic decision to focus our operations on the business intelligence market  the elimination or reduction of speculative technology initiatives  a reduction of our workforce and a consolidation of our multiple northern virginia facilities into a single location in mclean  virginia 
as a result of these restructuring plans  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million during for severance costs and other benefits for terminated employees  costs associated with exiting facilities and fees incurred for professional services directly related to the restructuring 
costs associated with exiting facilities included estimated sublease losses  representing the excess of lease costs over sublease income  estimated sublease commissions and concessions and other facility closing costs including rent expense while the office space is vacant 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the adequacy of our restructuring reserve based upon changes in current market conditions 
due to a decline in estimated sublease rates and an increase in the expected length of time to sublease vacant space  we updated our accrued restructuring costs by recording additional sublease losses of million during during  we further updated our estimated sublease losses and recorded an increase in our restructuring reserve of million due to a sustained high level of vacancy rates in the commercial real estate market and difficulties experienced in subleasing idle space 
amounts related to the estimated sublease losses associated with exiting facilities and terminations of computer and equipment leases will be paid over the respective lease terms through february as a result of the restructuring  we have approximately  square feet of office space that we do not occupy with the following expiration dates  square feet expire in august  and  square feet expire in february of the  square feet of office space that we do not occupy  all has been subleased as of december  the accrued restructuring costs as of december  of million primarily represented losses associated with office space that we do not occupy

benefit provision for income taxes 
during the year ending december   we recognized a net benefit for income taxes of million 
this benefit included a million release of valuation allowance on net operating loss carryforward and other deferred tax assets in our us and canadian subsidiaries 
this benefit was partially offset by income tax expense incurred in our foreign operations 
as of june   our us and canadian net operating losses nols and other deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance primarily because  at the time  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we did not have sufficient history of taxable income to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the tax benefits of those deferred tax assets 
based upon our cumulative operating results through september  and an assessment of our expected future results of operations  during the third quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a substantial portion of our us and canadian net operating loss carryforward tax assets prior to their expiration and other deferred tax assets 
as a result  at september   we released a total of million of our us and canadian deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
of the million  million of the valuation release was recorded as an income tax benefit in our statement of operations  and million of the valuation release was attributable to stock option exercises  which was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital on the balance sheet 
as disclosed during the third quarter of  an additional million of the valuation allowance was released during the fourth quarter of as a result of the requirement under accounting principles board apb no 
interim financial reporting to use an annualized effective tax rate for each interim period during the year  including current year interim periods after a valuation allowance release has occurred 
the total valuation allowance release recorded as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations during the third and fourth quarters of was million 
as reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows  we paid approximately million in cash for income taxes during during the years ended december  and  we recorded an income tax benefit of million and income tax expense of million  respectively 
the income tax benefit in included a million reduction of valuation allowances on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in certain foreign subsidiaries that continued to demonstrate profitability 
this benefit was partially offset by income tax expense incurred in our foreign operations 
also during  we recognized a deferred tax asset of million primarily related to domestic tax losses and certain other items 
however  because the realization of this deferred tax asset did not meet the more likely than not criteria under sfas no 
 we recorded a full valuation allowance on this benefit 
during  we utilized net operating loss carryforwards in certain foreign subsidiaries  which had the effect of reducing our effective tax rate and related tax expense 
additionally  our provision for income taxes in was offset in part by reductions of valuation allowances on net operating loss carryforwards in other foreign subsidiaries 
during the year ended december   we recognized a million net gain on the refinancing of our series b  c and d convertible preferred stock  which had no tax effect 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and other temporary differences  carryforwards  and credits  which resulted in net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
also as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million on 
table of contents our deferred tax assets 
the remaining valuation allowance is attributable to certain of our domestic and other deferred tax assets where the realization of such deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not criteria under sfas no 
the valuation allowance as of december  primarily relates to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and domestic capital loss carryforward tax assets that we expect will expire unused 
in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of domestic and foreign profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  actual results could differ materially from our projections 
we do not currently have plans to indefinitely reinvest undistributed foreign earnings 
accordingly  we expect to accrue a deferred tax liability less any applicable foreign tax credits on undistributed foreign earnings at such time as we have cumulative undistributed foreign earnings and an excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis 
currently there is an excess of the tax basis over the financial reporting basis for which no deferred tax asset has been recorded 
the determination of our consolidated provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the related valuation allowance involves judgment 
as a global company with subsidiaries in fifteen countries  we are required to calculate and provide for estimated income tax liabilities for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax obligations and exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the future recoverability of deferred tax assets 
changes in the estimated level of annual pre tax income  changes in tax laws particularly related to the utilization of net operating losses in various jurisdictions  and changes resulting from tax audits can all affect the overall effective income tax rate which  in turn  impacts the overall level of income tax expense and net income 
on october   the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes a temporary incentive for us companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings by providing an elective dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
this provision is effective either for or for calendar year taxpayers 
we are currently in the process of analyzing ajca and have not made a determination as to whether any actions will be taken as a result of this new law 
the ajca also includes a qualified manufacturing deduction 
at this time  we are evaluating the potential impact of this deduction on our financial condition and results of operations

income from discontinued operations 
on december   we discontinued the operations of our strategy 
com subsidiary and shut down its services 
accordingly  during  we recorded a loss from abandonment of our discontinued operations 
subsequent to the abandonment  we continued to assess the valuation of outstanding liabilities during each successive financial reporting period 
during  management concluded that the probability of incurring additional obligations or being required to perform services relating to a particular contract was remote 
as a result  we reversed the accrued liability related to this contract and recorded a gain on discontinued operations in the amount of  during our historical consolidated financial statements reflect strategy 
com as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
dividends  accretion and beneficial conversion feature on convertible preferred stock

table of contents accrete the carrying value of the beneficial conversion feature on the series d preferred stock

because the series f preferred stock was convertible immediately upon issuance  we fully amortized such beneficial conversion feature on the date of issuance 
during and  we did not have any outstanding shares of preferred stock 
accordingly  we did not accrue any preferred stock dividends or record any accretion on preferred stock during and net gain on refinancing of series b  c and d convertible preferred stock 
in connection with the refinancing of our series b  c and d convertible preferred stock in august for cash  promissory notes  class a common stock and series f preferred stock  we recorded a net gain attributable to common stockholders of million during this net gain represented the excess of the aggregate carrying value of the series b  c and d preferred securities being refinanced over the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the holders of such preferred securities

deferred revenue and advance payments from customers consist of the following  as of december  in thousands current deferred product licenses revenue deferred product support and other services revenue less billed and unpaid deferred revenue non current deferred product licenses revenue deferred product support and other services revenue less billed and unpaid deferred revenue we offset our accounts receivable and deferred revenue for any billed and unpaid items included in deferred revenue and advance payments

revenue relating to such agreements will be recognized during the period in which all revenue recognition criteria are met 
the timing and ultimate recognition of any revenue from such customer purchase commitments depend on our customers meeting their future purchase commitments and our meeting our associated performance obligations related to those purchase commitments

as a result of this transaction  we eliminated our remaining principal and interest obligations relating to our series a notes 
during the second quarter of  we entered into an enterprise agreement with a software vendor for software and support services to be provided to us over a three year period beginning june  and ending may  upon execution of the agreement  we recorded a short and long term liability of  and million  respectively  along with short and long term assets totaling  and million respectively 
our payments under this agreement are due in three annual installments of approximately  and commenced in july as of december   obligations under this agreement of  and  are classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long term liabilities  respectively

management believes that existing cash  cash equivalents  short and long term investments and cash anticipated to be generated internally by operations will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months

this statement amends abp to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
as we do not have any material nonmonetary exchanges of assets  we do not believe adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations

 the fasb determined that any benefit from the tax deduction on qualified production activities taken under the ajca should be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the tax return 
the deduction should be considered when determining the effective annual tax rate used for interim financial reporting and  if significant  should be disclosed separately in the effective tax rate reconciliation

 the fasb determined that a deferred tax liability for the tax effect of the excess of book basis over tax basis of an investment in a foreign subsidiary or foreign corporate joint venture that is permanent in duration  unless an enterprise affirmatively asserts that the such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside of the enterprise s home tax jurisdiction 
although sfas no 
requires that the effects of changes in tax laws be reflected in the period of enactment  because of the proximity of the ajca s enactment date to many companies year ends and the complexity of many of the ajca s provisions  the fasb provided companies with an exception to sfas no 
s requirements by providing them additional time to determine the amount of earnings  if any  that they intend to repatriate under the ajca s beneficial provisions 
however  if it is determined that an amount of earnings will be repatriated  the associated tax liability must be recognized in that period 
as we did not have material undistributed foreign earnings as of december   neither the ajca nor fsp no 
had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations during risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing microstrategy 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in the future we generated net income for the year ended december   however  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly or revenues fall below our expectations  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we have significant deferred tax assets  and if we are unable to sustain profitability  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets  which would result in a charge that would adversely affect net income in the period in which the charge is incurred 
our quarterly operating results  revenues and expenses may fluctuate significantly  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock for a number of reasons  including those described below  our operating results  revenues and expenses have in the past varied and may in the future vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of the size  timing  volume and execution of significant orders and shipments  the mix of products and services of customer orders  which can affect whether we recognize revenue upon the signing and delivery of our software products or whether revenue must be recognized as work progresses or over the entire contract period  the timing of new product announcements  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  market acceptance of business intelligence software generally and of new and enhanced versions of our products in particular  the length of our sales cycles  
table of contents changes in our operating expenses  personnel changes  our success in adding to our indirect distribution channels  utilization of our consulting personnel  which can be affected by delays or deferrals of customer implementation of our software products and consulting  education and support services  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which had a favorable impact on our results for the year ended december   our profitability and expectations for future profitability and its effect on our deferred tax assets and net income for the period in which any adjustment to our net deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be made  which resulted in an increase of million in our net income during  an increase that will not recur in future periods  and seasonal factors  such as our traditionally lower pace of new sales in the summer 
limited ability to adjust expenses 
we base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends 
many of our expenses  such as office leases and certain personnel costs  are relatively fixed 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter 
based on the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in one or more future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall 
we use strategic channel partners and if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with them  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition to our direct sales force  we use strategic channel partners such as value added resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers to license and support our products in the united states and internationally 
for the year ended december   and  channel partners accounted for  directly or indirectly  approximately  and of our total product licenses revenues  respectively 
our channel partners generally offer customers the products of several different companies  including some products that compete with ours 
although we believe that direct sales will continue to account for a majority of product license revenues  we seek to maintain a significant level of indirect sales activities through our strategic channel partners  however  we may not be successful in those efforts 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with those strategic partners 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with these strategic partners  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our recognition of deferred revenue and advance payments is subject to future performance obligations and may not be representative of revenues for succeeding periods our current and long term deferred revenue and advance payments were million as of december  the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments depend on our performance of various service obligations 
because of the possibility of customer changes in development schedules  delays in implementation and development efforts and the need to satisfactorily perform product support services  deferred revenue and advance payments at any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 

table of contents managing our international operations is complex and our failure to do so successfully or in a cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition international sales accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our international operations require significant management attention and financial resources 
there are certain risks inherent in our international business activities including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  tax issues  including restrictions on repatriating earnings  weaker intellectual property protection in other countries  economic weakness or currency related crises that may arise in different countries or geographic regions  and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may lose sales  or sales may be delayed  due to the long sales and implementation cycles for our products  which would reduce our revenues to date  our customers have typically invested substantial time  money and other resources and involved many people in the decision to license our software products and purchase our consulting and other services 
as a result  we may wait nine months or more after the first contact with a customer for that customer to place an order while it seeks internal approval for the purchase of our products and or services 
during this long sales cycle  events may occur that affect the size or timing of the order or even cause it to be canceled 
for example  our competitors may introduce new products  or the customer s own budget and purchasing priorities may change 
even after an order is placed  the time it takes to deploy our products and complete consulting engagements can vary widely from one customer to the next 
implementing our product can sometimes last several months  depending on the customer s needs  and may begin only with a pilot program 
it may be difficult to deploy our products if the customer has complicated deployment requirements  which typically involve integrating databases  hardware and software from different vendors 
if a customer hires a third party to deploy our products  we cannot be sure that our products will be deployed successfully 
we face intense competition  which may lead to lower prices for our products  reduced gross margins  loss of market share and reduced revenue the markets for business intelligence software  analytical applications and information delivery are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
in addition  many companies in these markets are offering  or may soon offer  products and services that may compete with microstrategy products 

table of contents microstrategy s most direct competitors include providers of business intelligence software  olap tools  ad hoc query tools  web based reporting tools  and report delivery and proactive alerting 
microstrategy faces competitors in several broad categories  including business intelligence software  analytical processes  query and web based reporting tools  and report delivery 
our competitors that are primarily focused on business intelligence products include actuate  business objects  cognos  hyperion solutions  information builders and the sas institute 
we also compete with large software corporations  including suppliers of enterprise resource planning software that provide one or more capabilities competitive with our products  including ibm  microsoft  oracle  sap ag and siebel systems 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business intelligence industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
increased competition may lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to meet the competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others 
by doing so  they may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers 
our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors 
these relationships may limit our ability to sell our products through specific distribution channels 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
these developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to maintain technical support revenues from our installed customer base 
our inability to develop and release product enhancements and new products to respond to rapid technological change in a timely and cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changing customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies can quickly make existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
we believe that our future success depends largely on three factors our ability to continue to support a number of popular operating systems and databases  our ability to maintain and improve our current product line  and our ability to rapidly develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
business intelligence applications are inherently complex  and it can take a long time to develop and test major new products and product enhancements 
in addition  customers may delay their purchasing decisions because they anticipate that new or enhanced versions of our products will soon become available 
we cannot be 
table of contents sure that we will succeed in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change or new customer requirements  nor can we be sure that any new products and product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect our ability to market our existing products the emergence of new industry standards in related fields may adversely affect the demand for our existing products 
this could happen  for example  if new web standards and technologies emerged that were incompatible with customer deployments of our products 
although the core database component of our business intelligence solutions is compatible with nearly all major enterprise server hardware and operating system combinations  such as os  as  unix  linux and windows  certain of our application server components run only on the windows server and server  solaris  and aix operating systems 
therefore  our ability to increase sales currently depends in part on the continued acceptance of these operating systems and in part on our ability to port certain components of our software to additional operating systems 
the nature of our products makes them particularly vulnerable to undetected errors  or bugs  which could cause problems with how the products perform and which could in turn reduce demand for our products  reduce our revenue and lead to product liability claims against us software products as complex as ours may contain errors or defects 
although we test our products extensively  we have in the past discovered software errors in new products after their introduction 
despite testing by us and by our current and potential customers  errors may be found in new products or releases after commercial shipments begin 
this could result in lost revenue or delays in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
our license agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not be effective under the laws of certain domestic or international jurisdictions 
although there have been no product liability claims against us to date  our license and support of products may involve the risk of these claims 
a successful product liability claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to recruit or retain skilled personnel  or if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  train  assimilate and retain highly skilled personnel 
competition for these employees is intense 
we may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract  train  assimilate or retain other highly skilled personnel in the future 
our future success also depends in large part on the continued service of key management personnel  particularly michael j 
saylor  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and sanju k 
bansal  our vice chairman  executive vice president and chief operating officer 
if we lose the services of one or both of these individuals or other key personnel  or if we are unable to attract  train  assimilate and retain the highly skilled personnel we need  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
because of the rights of our two classes of common stock  and because we are controlled by our existing holders of class b common stock  these stockholders could transfer control of microstrategy to a third party without anyone else s approval or prevent a third party from acquiring microstrategy we have two classes of common stock class a common stock and class b common stock 
holders of our class a common stock generally have the same rights as holders of our class b common stock  except that holders of class a common stock have one vote per share while holders of class b common stock have ten votes per share 
as of march   holders of our class b common stock owned  shares of class b 
table of contents common stock  or of the total voting power 
michael j 
saylor  our chairman  president  and chief executive officer  beneficially owned shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock  or of the total voting power  as of march  accordingly  mr 
saylor is able to control microstrategy through his ability to determine the outcome of elections of our directors  amend our certificate of incorporation and by laws and take other actions requiring the vote or consent of stockholders  including mergers  going private transactions and other extraordinary transactions and their terms 
our certificate of incorporation allows holders of class b common stock  almost all of whom are current employees or former employees of our company or related parties  to transfer shares of class b common stock  subject to the approval of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock 
mr 
saylor or a group of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock could  without seeking anyone else s approval  transfer voting control of microstrategy to a third party 
such a transfer of control could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
mr 
saylor or a group of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock will also be able to prevent a change of control of microstrategy  regardless of whether holders of class a common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
we have only limited protection for our proprietary rights in our software  which makes it difficult to prevent third parties from infringing upon our rights we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
policing such unauthorized use is difficult  and we cannot be certain that we can prevent it  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
our products may be susceptible to claims by other companies that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition as the number of software products in our target markets increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we may become increasingly subject to claims by a third party that our technology infringes such party s proprietary rights 
regardless of their merit  any such claims could be time consuming and expensive to defend  may divert management s attention and resources  could cause product shipment delays and could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
if successful  a claim of infringement against us and our inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
on october   business objects filed suit against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california  claiming that our software infringes a patent issued to business objects relating to relational database access the patent 
the suit sought injunctive relief and monetary damages 
on august   the court granted our motion for summary judgment and dismissed the lawsuit  ruling as a matter of law that our products do not infringe the patent 
business objects filed an appeal to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
the federal circuit heard oral arguments on september  on january   the federal circuit ruled that the district court had correctly construed the patent  that we do not literally infringe any of the asserted patent claims  and that business objects is legally barred from claiming that our products infringe two of the three asserted claims under the doctrine of equivalents 
as a result of the federal circuit s ruling  the case has been remanded to the district court for further proceedings limited solely to business objects one remaining patent claim  and limited solely to the doctrine of equivalents 
the federal circuit also reinstated all of our non infringement and invalidity counterclaims brought against business objects that the district court had not needed to address or decide 

table of contents on october   we filed suit against business objects  sa and its subsidiary  business objects americas  inc  in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia  claiming that business objects software infringes two patents held by us relating to asynchronous control of report generation using a web browser the patent and a system and method of adapting automatic output of olap reports to disparate user output devices the patent 
the complaint sought monetary damages and injunctive relief 
the complaint against business objects was amended to add claims for violations of the federal computer fraud and abuse act  misappropriation of trade secrets  tortious interference with contractual relations  and violations of the virginia conspiracy act 
as a result of pre trial rulings  certain of these claims were dismissed 
our claims for tortious interference and misappropriation of trade secrets proceeded to trial on october  on october   the court dismissed the tortious interference claim 
in july  the united states patent trademark office confirmed the validity of all the claims in the and patents and terminated reexamination proceedings that business objects had requested as to those patents 
we agreed to dismissal of the patent claims without prejudice 
on june   the court advised the parties that it intended to issue an order and opinion granting business objects motion for summary judgment of non infringement on our patent claims  and that the trial of the patent claims previously scheduled to begin on june  would not occur 
on august   the court granted business objects motion for summary judgment on the patent claims  ruling that business objects had not infringed our patent 
the court ruled in our favor on our claims of trade secret misappropriation  finding that business objects had misappropriated certain of our trade secrets 
on september   we filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit court 
business objects did not file a cross appeal 
we filed our opening appeal brief on january  in addition  on december   the district court denied our motion for costs and business objects motion for fees and costs 
each party appealed this ruling by filing a notice of appeal to the federal circuit on january  on january   the parties filed a joint motion to stay these appeals regarding fees and costs pending the outcome of the merits appeal 
this motion to stay was granted on march  on december   we filed a complaint for patent infringement against crystal decisions  inc in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
the lawsuit alleges that crystal decisions willfully infringes three patents issued to us relating to i asynchronous control of report generation using a web browser the patent  ii management of an automatic olap report broadcast system the patent  and iii providing business intelligence web content with reduced client side processing the patent

if the market for business intelligence software fails to grow as we expect  or if businesses fail to adopt our products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected nearly all of our revenues to date have come from sales of business intelligence software and related technical support  consulting and education services 
we expect these sales to account for a large portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
although demand for business intelligence software has grown in recent years  the market for business intelligence software applications is still emerging 
resistance from consumer and privacy groups to increased commercial collection and use of data on spending patterns and other personal behavior and european union restrictions on the collection and use of personal data may impair the further growth of this market  as may other developments 
we cannot be sure that this market will continue to grow or  even if it does grow  that businesses will adopt our solutions 
we have spent  and intend to keep spending  considerable resources to educate potential customers about business intelligence software in general and our solutions in particular 
however  we cannot be sure that these expenditures will help our products achieve any additional market acceptance 
if the market fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently expect  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents the price of our stock may be extremely volatile the market price for our class a common stock has historically been volatile and could fluctuate significantly for any of the following reasons quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights  technological innovations or new products  governmental regulatory action  general conditions in the software industry  increased price competition  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
many of the above factors are beyond our control 
the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market price of many software companies  often without regard to their operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we invest our excess cash in short term  fixed income financial instruments 
these fixed rate investments are subject to interest rate risk and may fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels at december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including but not limited to differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in foreign exchange rates would have had an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
international revenues were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international revenues will continue to account for a significant amount of total revenues 
to date  we have not hedged the risks associated with foreign exchange exposure 
although we may do so in the future  we cannot be sure that any hedging techniques we may implement will be successful or that our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations
