item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the company s past performance  its financial condition and its prospects 
we will discuss and provide our analysis of the following overview results of operations in process research and development off balance sheet arrangements liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of fairchild international  excluding subsidiaries critical accounting policies and estimates forward looking statements policy on business outlook disclosure and quiet periods outlook recently issued financial accounting standards overview from our beginning as an independent semiconductor company in  we have grown both organically and through acquisitions to become the top supplier of power semiconductors in the world 
we have focused on developing semiconductor products that provide solutions for power management  which we refer to as power products  that serve fast growing consumer  computing  automotive  industrial and communications markets 
we have also rapidly expanded our presence in the asian regional markets  specifically korea  and in china  where we see the highest growth potential over the next several years 
our organic and acquisition driven growth  our ability to service multiple end markets  and our focus on growing in asia  have all contributed to an increase in revenue from power products from just of total sales in fiscal year to of total sales in in alone  we grew power revenue by 
we have a wide portfolio of new products that leverage expertise in both analog and discrete power technologies  including some of our newest products that provide our customers with an integrated total power management solution in a single  multi chip module package 
we believe gross margins and operating margins are key indices that reflect our progress in developing higher value  new products  as well as our ability to manufacture at low cost levels 
both senior management and our investors utilize these indices to measure the financial performance of the company 
during  we improved our gross margins due to improved product mix and lower costs 
other key indices we use include factors such as days sales outstanding dso and inventory turn ratios 
dso decreased to in compared to in inventory turns decreased slightly to in compared to in in addition  the company tracks blended factory utilization  which was approximately in distributor inventory was approximately weeks at the end of  which is above our target of weeks of supply on hand 
we also continue to focus on our cash and investment balances  and have reported straight quarters of positive operating cash flow 
we continue to follow our asset light investment strategy for our non power products  which typically have lower gross margins and lower or negative long term sales growth potential 
through this strategy we are gradually transferring the manufacturing for these mature products to third party subcontractors  allowing our own manufacturing facilities to focus on building higher growth  higher margin and more strategic products 
we believe that by following this long term asset light approach for mature products we will improve our 
table of contents return on invested capital and lessen our exposure to falling prices on commodity products during industry downturns 
we believe the power semiconductor market will grow at the same or better rate than the total semiconductor market over the foreseeable future 
our strategy will be to design and build higher value power products that leverage our strength in power wafer processes  packaging technology and applications knowledge to drive higher and more stable margins and earnings through all phases of the business cycle 
we also plan to continue investing in our more modern fabrication facilities and in our new suzhou  china assembly and test plant as we believe these are the significant factors that will help us to continue to improve gross and operating margins 
overall  our focus will remain on growing profitable market share in our power markets 
results of operations the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results as derived from our audited consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  december  december  dollars in millions total revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of acquisition related intangibles restructuring and impairments purchased in process research and development gain on sale of space and defense product line reserve for potential settlement losses total operating expenses operating income loss interest expense interest income other expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues 
total revenues increased million in compared to this increase was driven primarily by continued growth in the power management market  new product introductions  and overall improved industry and economic conditions compared to  particularly in the first half of 
table of contents as a percentage of sales  geographic sales for the united states  other americas  europe  china  taiwan  other asia pacific which for these geographic reporting purposes includes japan and singapore and excludes korea and korea were as follows for and year ended december  december  united states other americas europe china taiwan other asia pacific korea total the increase in our china percentage of sales is due to our growing customer base  as well as our commitment to investing our resources in this growing region 
korean revenues as a percentage of total revenues declined due to our efforts to enrich our product mix and focus on selling products with higher margins 
gross profit 
the increase in gross profit for compared to was due to increased revenues  improved product mix and higher factory utilization 
approximately of the gross profit increase was due to increased revenues  with the remaining increase due to the improved product mix and factory utilization 
for  gross profit includes a net sales reserve release of million and a net inventory charge of million recorded in revenue and cost of sales  respectively  in connection with our restructuring actions 
for  gross profit includes sales reserves of million and inventory reserves of million in connection with product discontinuations as a result of our various restructuring actions 
operating expenses 
research and development r d and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were both flat as a percentage of sales for as compared to the decrease in amortization of acquisition related intangibles is due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of in order to better align our cost structure with our revenues  we continually consider the rationalization of both our manufacturing operations and our workforce levels 
as a result  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million in these charges include million of costs associated with the closure of our six inch fab in mountaintop  pennsylvania  million of net costs associated with the closure of our four inch south portland  maine wafer fab  million in employee separation costs relating to our infrastructure realignment program  million of costs associated with the closure of our kuala lumpur  malaysia plant  and million of asset impairment charges related to the discontinuation of our memory product line 
in addition  we released million in reserves primarily associated with the restructuring program 
the charges associated with the mountaintop and south portland fabs  and the kuala lumpur plant were the remaining charges from our restructuring plan announced in july the company recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million in these charges included million of employee separation costs for severance and other costs associated with workforce reduction actions undertaken during the year  including the closure of our six inch fab in mountaintop  the closure of the four inch fab in south portland  plant closures in wuxi  china and kuala lumpur and million of impairment  decommissioning and other exit costs relating to the closure of our above referenced fab and plant closures  as well as asset impairment charges in bucheon  south korea 
total net costs for the closure of the six inch wafer fab in mountaintop were approximately million for severance and million for all other related costs and impairments 
this closure is considered 
table of contents substantially complete as of december  based on comparisons to our fourth quarter spending levels  the closure of the mountaintop six inch fab is expected to save us approximately million annually in manufacturing costs  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of approximately employees 
total net costs for the south portland closure were approximately million in severance and million in asset impairments and other exit costs including decommissioning and technology transfer costs 
this closure is considered substantially complete as of december  the south portland four inch fab closure is expected to save us approximately million annually in manufacturing costs  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of approximately employees 
total net costs for the wuxi and kuala lumpur closures are approximately million in severance and million in asset impairments and other exit costs including decommissioning and technology transfer costs 
both of these closures are considered substantially complete as of december  these closures are expected to save us approximately million annually in manufacturing costs beginning in  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of approximately  employees 
we determined in that there were certain wafer fabrication assets located in bucheon for which the carrying amount exceeded the expected undiscounted cash flow from their use 
accordingly  a charge of million was recorded to reflect these long lived assets at their fair value  based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
these asset impairments reduced depreciation costs by approximately million annually 
total charges for ongoing infrastructure realignment in were million  which allowed us to achieve approximately million in savings on an annualized basis 
the infrastructure realignment program actions announced in will impact both manufacturing and non manufacturing personnel  primarily in the united states  and are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of as a result of the million charged  including salary and benefits associated with the termination of approximately employees  we anticipate cost savings of approximately million in manufacturing and non manufacturing costs on an annualized basis beginning in in the second quarter of  we recorded million as a reserve for potential settlement losses 
see item  note of this report for further information 
purchased in process research and development was million for in  ipr d resulted from the purchase of raytheon s non military rf components business completed in the fourth quarter of interest expense 
interest expense decreased in due to the redemption of million of the senior subordinated notes on june  this redemption was partially offset by interest on our million term loan 
interest income 
the increase in interest income in is due to the increase in average cash  short term and long term marketable securities balances and improved rates of return earned on those balances as compared to other expense 
in  we recorded a charge of million related to losses associated with strategic investments 
during  we recorded other expense of million associated with the redemption of our senior subordinated notes and the refinancing of our revolving line of credit 
these costs included million for the call premium on the senior subordinated notes and other transaction fees and a million non cash write off of deferred financing fees associated with the original bond offering and revolving line of credit 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate was on income before taxes of million and on loss before taxes of million for and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate in as compared to is primarily due to changes in the magnitude and location of taxable income among taxing jurisdictions 
changes in the location of taxable income loss can result in significant changes in the 
table of contents effective tax rate 
an additional valuation allowance against deferred taxes in the amount of million was also recorded in comparative disclosures of revenue and gross profit of our reportable segments are as follows year ended december  december  gross gross revenue of total profit revenue of total profit dollars in millions analog and mixed signal discrete logic and memory other total analog and mixed signal products group 
the increase in analog revenue was driven primarily by strong backlog and unit shipments  accounting for approximately of the increase  across all analog products  particularly in our power products 
while demand increased  average selling prices remained roughly flat to levels  contributing of the revenue increase 
gross profits also improved significantly over  primarily due to higher revenue  but also an improved product mix and higher factory utilization 
during  we made significant improvements to our product mix between newer products with generally higher selling prices and gross margins  and our older  less differentiated standard products 
we also increased our market share during in the overall analog market 
customer demand that began increasing late in the third quarter of continued through the second quarter of  but slowed during the second half of  as the supply chain had been replenished with adequate inventory 
for our older  standard linear products  revenues and margins declined approximately  due to lower demand on these already low margin products 
as capacity tightened  these products were diminished in our product mix 
throughout this time  we continued our emphasis on new products that support lower power consumption and smaller dimensions  including our green fps tm power switches  which grew significantly during in  gross profit includes million of sales reserve releases and million of inventory reserves  recorded in revenue and cost of sales  respectively  both associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our restructuring actions 
analog gross profit in includes million of sales reserves recorded in revenue and million of inventory charges recorded in cost of sales  both associated with our restructuring actions 
analog had operating income loss of million in compared to million in the increase in operating income improved commensurate with the gross profit improvements 
r d was roughly flat 
sg a expenses increased proportionately with the increase in revenues  and included incremental technical sales support of our new products in the united states and china 
amortization of acquisition related intangibles decreased as certain intangibles became fully amortized 
discrete products group 
discrete revenue increased nearly in compared to revenue growth came across all products  particularly in high power and low power products 
increases in average selling prices accounted for approximately of the revenue increase  while unit volumes accounted for approximately of the revenue increase 
this was driven by the transition from limited demand in to a limited supply in  enabling greater pricing leverage and product mix 
we experienced particular growth in our newer products  including mosfets  using our powertrench iii and powertrench iv processes  and our spm tm  which both contributed to the increase 
revenue growth was strongest in china and taiwan  which together accounted for approximately half of discrete revenues 
in the second half of  demand slowed  particularly in the low power products  as computing and cell phone demand slowed and the supply chain had been replenished with adequate inventory 
gross profits increased due to an improved product mix of higher margin and new technology products  favorable market conditions  and conversion to our newer powertrench technologies  which have significantly lower die costs 
gross profit in includes a 
table of contents million sales reserve release recorded in revenue and a million inventory reserve release recorded in cost of sales 
discrete gross profit in includes million of sales reserves and million of inventory reserves  recorded in revenue and cost of sales  respectively 
the and charges are both associated with our restructuring actions 
discrete had operating income of million in compared to million in the increase in operating income was a result of the improved gross profits discussed above 
r d expenses  as well as sg a expenses  were roughly flat 
amortization of acquisition related intangibles decreased due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized 
logic and memory products group 
logic and memory revenue declined in due to the phase out of our memory product line  which was completed at the end of the second quarter of excluding memory which was million and million in and  respectively  revenues increased due to a improvement in average selling prices resulting from a richer product mix and pricing improvements  particularly in mature logic and low voltage products  in the first half of during the second half  prices began to soften 
unit volumes decreased approximately from levels  across virtually all products due to constrained wafer supplies during the first half which resulted from the company s asset light strategy for these products 
gross profits improved year over year due to the improved pricing and product mix as well as increased factory utilization 
gross profit includes million sales reserve releases  recorded in revenue in due to a change in distributor reserve estimates 
an inventory reserves release of million recorded in cost of sales in gross profit in includes million of sales reserves and million of inventory charges  both associated with our restructuring actions 
both were associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our restructuring actions 
logic and memory had operating income loss of million in compared to million in the increase in operating income was a result of the gross profit improvements as well as decreases in sg a and r d expenses 
sg a expenses decreased due to the consolidation of selling functions and the discontinuation of allocated expenses to the memory product line 
r d expenses decreased due to the elimination of spending on memory related products as well as a refocus of resources to our strategic power related development 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues 
total revenues were down to  million in compared to  million in revenues were impacted in by the continued semiconductor industry recession  as well as the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  particularly in the middle part of the units shipped were nearly flat year over year  but pricing pressures  particularly in our analog and logic and memory product lines  drove revenues lower 
as a percentage of sales  geographic sales for the united states  other americas  europe  china  taiwan  other asia pacific which for our geographic reporting purposes includes japan and singapore and excludes korea and korea were as follows for and year ended december  december  united states other americas europe china taiwan other asia pacific korea total 
table of contents gross profit 
for  gross profit includes sales reserves of million and inventory reserves of million in connection with product discontinuations as a result of our various restructuring actions 
for  gross profit includes inventory reserves of million in connection with the analog restructuring action 
the remaining decrease in gross profit was a result of continued pricing pressures across most product lines  partially offset by on going manufacturing cost reductions see separate product line discussions below 
operating expenses 
during  in our continued response to the semiconductor industry downturn  we implemented many cost reduction efforts to reduce our operating expenses 
we reprioritized r d activities on products and technologies in support of power semiconductors and cut costs in r d for other non focus areas 
the increases in sg a were the result of the resumption of certain employee related benefits in these spending increases were partially offset by further cuts in discretionary spending as well as workforce reductions 
the decrease in amortization of acquisition related intangibles is due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry and in order to align our cost structure with our revenues  during we continued to look at the rationalization of both our manufacturing operations and our workforce levels 
as a result  the company recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million in these charges included million of employee separation costs for severance and other costs associated with workforce reduction actions undertaken during the year  including the closure of our six inch fab in mountaintop  pa  the closure of the four inch fab in south portland  me  the plant closures in wuxi  china and kuala lumpur  malaysia  and million of impairment  decommissioning and other exit costs relating to the closure of our above referenced fab and plant closures  as well as asset impairment charges in bucheon  south korea 
as a result of the restructuring plans commenced during  we completed actions expected to result in cost savings of approximately million on an annualized basis when compared to our cost structure during the fourth quarter of for actions initiated during and finalized in  original estimates were to achieve to million of additional annualized cost savings 
restructuring and impairments of million were recorded in these charges included million of employee separation costs for severance and other costs associated with workforce reduction actions undertaken during the year  million for contract termination costs and million of impairment charges related to the closure of our carlsbad  california facility 
as a result of the restructuring plans completed during  we achieved approximately million in annualized cost savings when compared to our cost structure at the beginning of for further detailed disclosure relating to our restructuring and impairment charges during and  please see item  note of this report 
in  ipr d resulted from the purchase of raytheon s non military rf components business completed in the fourth quarter of in  ipr d resulted from our acquisitions of i cube and signal processing technologies  inc spt 
these charges were considered immaterial for and a gain on the sale of our space and defense product line was recorded in that did not reoccur in as a result of the sale of our space and defense product line for million  a pre tax gain on sale of million was recorded 
the net carrying value of the assets sold consisted primarily of inventory million  developed technology million  and customer contracts  net of certain liabilities million not assumed by the buyer 
interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense was principally the result of the redemption of million of senior subordinated notes on june  as well as the redemption of million of senior subordinated notes on june  reduced interest from these redemptions is partially offset by interest on our million term loan which carried an interest rate of approximately at december  interest income 
the decrease in interest income was due to a lower interest rate environment in other expense 
during  we recorded other expense of million associated with the redemption of our senior subordinated notes and the refinancing of our revolving line of credit 
these costs included million for the call premium on the senior subordinated notes and other transaction fees 
table of contents and a million non cash write off of deferred financing fees associated with the original bond offering and revolving line of credit 
during  we recorded other expense of million associated with the redemption of our senior subordinated notes 
these costs included million for the call premium on the senior subordinated notes and other transaction fees and a million non cash write off of deferred financing fees associated with the original bond offering 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate was on loss before taxes of million and on loss before taxes of million for and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate in as compared to was due to changes in the magnitude and location of taxable income loss among taxing jurisdictions 
changes in the location of taxable income loss could result in significant changes in the effective tax rate 
comparative disclosures of revenue and gross profit of our reportable segments are as follows year ended december  december  gross gross revenue of total profit revenue of total profit dollars in millions analog and mixed signal discrete logic and memory other total analog and mixed signal products group 
the decrease in analog revenue was driven primarily by declining average selling prices on slightly higher unit volumes  across virtually all products 
consistent with the overall analog market  these pricing pressures continued throughout due to factory utilization at historically low levels 
markets in all regions were soft  particularly in asia where the sars epidemic drove significant demand and pricing weakness during the second and third quarters of gross profits declined year over year due to the previously discussed pricing pressures and weak economic climate 
the decreases during also include million of sales reserves included in revenue  and million of inventory charges included in cost of sales  both associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our restructuring actions  offset by a million inventory charge included in cost of sales in  associated with the analog restructuring action 
starting in late  demand  unit shipments and gross profits for analog products improved  primarily due to a recovery in asia and new product success in analog switches 
analog had operating income loss of million in compared to million in the decrease in analog s operating income was consistent with declines in gross profits due to the previously discussed severe pricing pressure and lower factory utilization throughout most of r d and sg a expenses were roughly flat year over year 
strategic r d spending was maintained despite tough economic conditions  which proved vital to improved market share in discrete products group 
the increase in discrete revenues was due to increased average selling prices somewhat offset by lower unit volumes 
the increase in prices and decrease in unit volumes was somewhat offset by the small signal business  which is categorized by low average selling prices and high unit volumes 
the increases in average selling prices were also partially offset by the divestiture of the space and defense product line  which was characterized by high margins and high average selling prices 
excluding million of revenues in related to the space and defense product line  which we divested  discrete revenues increased approximately over  primarily from our power discrete products 
these products showed strength in computing and communications segment  particularly in the second half of as the industry rebounded from the sars epidemic in asia 
while revenues increased  gross profits were roughly flat primarily due to the divestiture of the space and defense product line  which as discussed  historically was characterized with higher margins 
gross profits in also include million of sales reserves and 
table of contents million of inventory  both associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our restructuring actions 
discrete had operating income of million in as compared to million in the increase in operating income was due primarily to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized at the end of r d expenses increased slightly due to the rf acquisition in the fourth quarter of sg a expenses were flat as a percentage of sales 
logic and memory products group 
the decrease in logic and memory revenues was driven primarily by a sharp decline in average selling prices on roughly flat unit volumes  particularly in our mature logic products 
advanced logic and tiny logic products also experienced significant pricing pressures  however unit volume improvement nearly offset the declines in selling prices 
gross profits also declined year over year due to the previously discussed pricing pressures  particularly in korea and asia  and lower factory utilization due to a change in product mix 
the decreases during also include million of sales reserves and million of inventory charges  both associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our restructuring actions 
during  we also announced the exit from our memory business  which contributed to already existing revenue declines 
the revenues for memory declined from logic and memory had operating income loss of million in  compared to million in the decrease in logic and memory s operating income was a result of gross profit declines due to the pricing pressures and industry conditions discussed above 
these declines were offset slightly by lower r d spending in our mature product lines as well as lower sg a expenses 
the reduction in spending was due to cost cutting in response to declining market conditions 
in process research and development the company incurred charges for in process research and development ipr d of million and million in and  respectively 
these charges were considered immaterial for and off balance sheet arrangements the company has an off balance sheet loan guarantee  totaling million
