item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations marketing marketing segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands revenues operating earnings depreciation marketing segment operating statistics were as follows wellhead purchases per day crude oil  bbls  bbls  bbls natural gas  mmbtu  mmbtu  mmbtu average purchase price crude oil bbl bbl bbl natural gas mmbtu mmbtu mmbtu reflects the volume purchased from third parties by the company at the lease level and pipeline pooling points 
commodity purchases and sales associated with the company s natural gas marketing activities qualify as derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
therefore  natural gas purchases and sales are recorded on a net revenue basis in the accompanying financial statements 
in contrast  substantially all purchases and sales of crude oil qualify  and have been designated as  normal purchases and sales 
therefore  crude oil purchases and sales are recorded on a gross revenue basis in the accompanying financial statements 
as a result  variations in gross revenues are primarily a function of crude oil volumes and prices while operating earnings fluctuate with both crude oil and natural gas margins and volumes 
included in  and crude oil revenues is   and  respectively  of gross proceeds associated with certain crude oil buy sell arrangements 
crude oil buy sell arrangements result from a single contract or concurrent contracts with a single counterparty to provide for similar quantities of crude oil to be bought and sold at two different locations 
such contracts may be entered into for a variety of reasons including to affect the transportation of the commodity  to minimize credit exposure  and to meet the competitive demands of customers 
financial reporting standards continue to evolve in this area  and in the future  the reporting for such buy sell arrangements may be required to be on a net basis similar to the company s practice for natural gas operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
marketing revenues increased by percent to over billion for compared to  while operating earnings in the current year increased by percent to  the revenue increase resulted from crude oil price increases partially offset by wellhead purchase volume declines 
escalating crude oil prices from the range at the end of to the range by year end enhanced current operating results as the company liquidated lower price inventory into a higher price market 
this event contributed approximately  to operating earnings 
as of december   the company held  barrels of crude oil inventory at an average price of per barrel 
partially offsetting the earnings effect of crude oil price increases was  of losses sustained within the company s gasoline and diesel fuel wholesale business 
such losses occurred when refined product supply and distribution costs increased faster than the price to the company s end market customers 
also included in results was  of income resulting from settlement of a dispute associated with the company s previous marketing joint venture 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  during the company collected and recognized as income  of cash on previous disputed and fully reserved items 
further during  the company recognized a  gain from the sale of its claim against the bankrupt estate of enron corp 
and a  charge to write down certain slow moving refined product inventory items 
these generally favorable events compare to the company experiencing million in reduced marketing expenses during caused by the reversal of certain previously recorded accrual items resulting from the final true ups of the accounting for such items 
gross revenues for the marketing operation were essentially flat for compared to as crude oil price increases were offset by reductions in crude oil purchase volumes 
by comparison  operating earnings increased by million or percent for relative to the earnings improvement resulted  in part  from improved per unit margins for both crude oil and natural gas 
most notably in the first half of  the war in iraq caused elevated demand for near term or prompt month crude oil prices 
this presented premium value opportunities for resale of the crude oil being acquired by the company 
in addition  per unit margins for natural gas also improved during as a result of reduced competition in this sector of the marketplace 
also during  the company reduced marketing operating expenses by million from the reversal of previously recorded accrual items 
however  such accrual reversal in was offset by fee income totaling  during the first six months of this fee originated pursuant to the terms of an agreement to dissolve the company s williams gulfmark joint venture 
previously  the company earned fees approximating  per month based on the quantity of crude oil being purchased by the former co venture participant in the offshore gulf of mexico region 
with july business  credit constraints caused the former venture participant to substantially curtail and ultimately cease its purchases of the crude oil in the region 
as a result  the company s opportunity for fee income ceased during transportation the transportation segment experienced a strong resurgence in demand beginning in the spring of and continuing into revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings depreciation represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
transportation segment results are closely tied to trends for the united states economy in general and more specifically  to the domestic petrochemical industry 
as a common carrier transporter of bulk liquid chemicals  demand for the company s services is closely tied to the economic activity of domestic manufacturers of petrochemicals 
the company enjoyed strong demand for its trucking services during  which caused a percent increase in revenues to  the demand improvement was consistent with an improving u 
s 
economy and a weaker dollar exchange rate stimulating export demand for petrochemicals 
based on the current level of infrastructures  the company s transportation segment is designed to maximize efficiency at revenues approaching million per year 
because of the fixed cost component of operating expenses  operating earnings when expressed as a percentage change will increase or decrease relatively faster than the rate of increase or decrease existing for revenues 
with the market conditions that existed in  the company was able to both maximize efficiency and increase freight rates 
in addition  during the company sold certain used truck tractors for a gain on sales of  as compared to a  gain on equipment sales in this combination of factors provided a percent increase in operating earnings to  demand for the company s trucking service has remained strong and is spurred by an improving united states and world economy 
other important factors include reduced levels of competition as the industry experienced a general shake out in recent years coupled with service delays by the railroad industry 
presently  the company s transportation business continues to run at or near full capacity 
oil and gas oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily derived from crude oil and natural gas production volumes and prices 
comparative amounts are as follows in thousands revenues operating earnings loss depreciation and depletion production volumes crude oil  bbls  bbls  bbls natural gas  mcf  mcf  mcf average price crude oil bbl bbl bbl natural gas mcf mcf mcf as shown above  oil and gas division revenues and operating earnings improved in relative to and in relative to due to increased crude oil and natural gas production volumes as well as higher prices 
recent results from exploration efforts caused the production volume increases 
during  the company participated in the drilling of thirty three wells 
twenty wells were successfully completed with seven dry holes and six wells in process at year end 
in addition to the completions of wells spud in  the company also successfully brought on production one well that was drilling at year end all of the wells in process at december  were subsequently determined in the first quarter of to be productive 
although oil and gas revenues increased by percent during  operating earnings were relatively unchanged at  for the year 
improvement in operating earnings did not correlate with improved revenues because  of exploration expense was incurred during compared to  of exploration expenses occurring during exploration expense in included a  impairment provision on non producing properties plus  of dry hole and geological and geophysical costs 
comparative operating earnings for were also adversely affected by a percent increase in the provision for depreciation and depletion 
the depreciation and depletion provision in included a  impairment provision on certain producing properties where actual drilling costs incurred exceed the estimated fair value of the property 
the results of exploration efforts yielded estimated reserve additions totaling  barrels of oil and  mcf of gas 
with the company s production for being  barrels of oil and  mcf of gas  the estimated reserve additions for represent a percent replacement of current production on an oil equivalent barrel basis 
estimated future undiscounted net cash flow before income taxes from oil and gas properties was increased from  at year end to  at year end presently  the company s drilling and exploration efforts are primarily focused as follows ft 
bend  wharton and colorado counties  texas the company initiated the drilling of nine wells in in this area of texas  with seven proving to be productive and two dry holes 
one of the dry holes was lost due to mechanical reasons and the replacement well was successful 
the success in results from interpretation of work done on a d seismic data acquisitions made in the company and one of its joint interest partners expanded exploration in this area in by acquiring additional seismic data and applying the same seismic reprocessing techniques that led to the initial drilling successes in the area 
the first two wells on this newly acquired seismic data were drilled in the first quarter and are productive 
a number of additional prospects will be drilled in the area during calcasieu parish  louisiana during  the company drilled nine wells with one dry hole in the calcasieu area 
at the end of  three of the successful wells were waiting on the installation of surface production facilities and are scheduled to be producing beginning in the first quarter supported by a d seismic survey conducted in  the company and its joint interest partners have a continuing drilling program with additional prospects identified for drilling in southern alabama in southern alabama  processing and evaluation of a large proprietary d seismic survey was completed in and resulted in numerous prospects to be drilled in two of these wells were drilled in the first quarter as dry holes 
additional drilling will proceed during taking into consideration the knowledge gained from these wells 
lafayette parish  louisiana due to the relative risk associated with an available prospect in lafayette parish  the company took less than one percent interest in the drilling of an initial well that proved to be successful in significantly  the company s interest in the offset acreage is approximately five percent  and the offset well will be drilled in the second quarter of u 
k 
north sea seismic reprocessing and evaluation to confirm a drillable prospect has continued on the company s interest in block b of the central uk north sea 
beginning in the second quarter of presentations will be made to prospective joint interest partners in an attempt to promote the drilling of an exploratory well  hopefully before year end 
additionally  in the uk north sea  the company s bid for a promote license in the nd licensing round held last summer was accepted 
the company will have a equity interest in block c  located in the southern sector of the north sea 
the license was officially granted in february the company with its joint interest partners will have two years to acquire existing d and d seismic data and reprocess it to confirm an exploration prospect identified on the block 
the terms of the license do not include a well commitment 
if a block c prospect is confirmed by the seismic data  the company and its joint interest partners will seek an additional partner to drill a well on a promoted basis  thus limiting capital exposure on the drilling of the initial exploratory well 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased  or percent  in as a result of increased personnel related expenses as both the number and average wage of administrative personnel increased during the year 
an additional minimum percent or million increase is expected for as the company continues to expand its corporate governance and sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
discontinued operations during  the company s management decided to withdraw from its new england region retail natural gas marketing business 
because of the losses sustained and the desire to reduce working capital requirements  management decided to exit this region and type of account 
an early withdrawal from the region was instituted in and the exit from this business was completed in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
outlook looking ahead for the marketing operation  management does not foresee a substantial change in for this business 
overall  a sound profitable operation should continue 
for transportation  the strengthened level of demand is expected to remain 
for oil and gas exploration  a strong price environment continues and drilling activity is expected to increase 
in addition  the company is pursuing other exploration opportunities for development in and beyond 
the company has the following major objectives for maintain marketing operating earnings at the million level 
increase transportation operating earnings by percent to the million level 
improve oil and gas operating earnings to million while growing the oil and gas reserve base by percent 
liquidity and capital resources management s practice is to generally balance the cash flow requirements of the company s investment activities with available cash generated from operations 
as a result  over time  cash utilized for property and equipment additions  tends to track with the non cash provision for depreciation  depletion and amortization 
however  during  the company diverged from its normal practice 
a summary analysis of cash flows follows in thousands years ended december  total depreciation  depletion and amortization property and equipment additions other sources uses of cash several factors led to increased property and equipment expenditures 
one factor was the december  expiration of certain federal tax provisions that afforded accelerated depreciation rates on new equipment purchases 
the company availed itself of this opportunity through the cash purchase of million of truck tractors and trailers for its transportation fleet 
ordinarily  such equipment is obtained through operating lease financing 
additionally  was a growth year for the company s transportation and oil and gas segments and available cash balances were utilized for such expenditures 
presently  management intends to restrict investment decisions to available cash flow 
significant  if any  additions to debt are not anticipated 
banking relationships the company s primary bank loan agreement with bank of america provides for two separate lines of credit with interest at the bank s prime rate minus of one percent 
the working capital loan provides for borrowings up to  based on percent of eligible accounts receivable and percent of eligible inventories 
available capacity under the line is calculated monthly and as of december  was established at  the oil and gas production loan provides for flexible borrowings subject to a borrowing base established semi annually by the bank 
the borrowing base was established at  as of march  the line of credit loans are scheduled to expire on october   with the then present balance outstanding converting to a term loan payable in eight equal quarterly installments 
as of december   bank debt outstanding under the company s two revolving credit facilities totaled the bank of america revolving loan agreement  among other things  places certain restrictions with respect to additional borrowings and the purchase or sale of assets  as well as requiring the company to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintaining a to ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities  maintaining a to ratio of pre tax net income to interest expense  and consolidated net worth in excess of  the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  the company s gulfmark energy  inc subsidiary maintains a separate banking relationship with bnp paribas in order to support its crude oil purchasing activities 
in addition to providing up to million in letters of credit  the facility also finances up to million of crude oil inventory and certain accounts receivable associated with crude oil sales 
such financing is provided on a demand note basis with interest at the bank s prime rate plus one percent 
as of december   the company had million of eligible borrowing capacity under this facility 
no working capital advances were outstanding as of december  letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled approximately million as of december  the letter of credit and demand note facilities are secured by substantially all of gulfmark s and arm s assets 
under this facility  bnp paribas has the right to discontinue the issuance of letters of credit without prior notification to the company 
the company s adams resources marketing subsidiary also maintains a separate banking relationship with bnp paribas in order to support its natural gas purchasing activities 
in addition to providing up to million in letters of credit  the facility finances up to million of general working capital needs 
such financing is provided on a demand note basis with interest at the bank s prime rate plus percent 
no working capital advances were outstanding under this facility as of december  letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled approximately million as of december  the letter of credit and demand note facilities are secured by substantially all of gulfmark s and arm s assets 
under this facility  bnp paribas has the right to discontinue the issuance of letters of credit without prior notification to the company 
off balance sheet arrangements the company maintains certain operating lease arrangements to provide tractor and trailer equipment for the company s truck fleet 
all such operating lease commitments qualify for off balance sheet treatment as provided by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
the company has operating lease arrangements for tractors  trailers  office space  and other equipment and facilities 
rental expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
at december   commitments under long term noncancelable operating leases for the next five years and thereafter are payable as follows      and thereafter contractual cash obligations in addition to its banking relationships and obligations  the company enters into certain operating leasing arrangements for tractors  trailers  office space and other equipment and facilities 
the company has no capital lease obligations 
a summary of the payment periods for contractual debt and lease obligations is as follows in thousands thereafter total long term debt operating leases total in addition to its bank debt and lease financing obligations  the company is also committed to purchase certain quantities of crude oil and natural gas in connection with its marketing activities 
such commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales  which generate the cash flow necessary to meet such purchase obligations 
see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximate commodity purchase obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands january remaining thereafter total crude oil natural gas refined products investment activities during  the company invested approximately  in oil and gas projects   for replacement equipment for its petrochemical trucking fleet and  in equipment for the company s marketing operations 
oil and gas exploration and development efforts continue  and the company plans to invest approximately million toward such projects in including  of seismic costs to be expensed during the year 
an additional approximate million is projected in for the purchase of transportation equipment as present lease financing arrangements mature 
insurance the marketplace for all forms of insurance has entered a period of severe cost increases 
in the past  during such cyclical periods  the company has seen cost increases to the point where desired levels of insurance were either unavailable or unaffordable 
the company s primary insurance needs are in the area of automobile and umbrella coverage for its trucking fleet and medical insurance for employees 
during  the company s insurance costs increased percent to total million 
during  insurance cost stabilized and totaled million 
overall insurance cost may experience renewed rate increases during since the company is generally unable to pass on such cost increases  any increase will need to be absorbed by existing operations 
competition in all phases of its operations  the company encounters strong competition from a number of entities 
many of these competitors possess financial resources substantially in excess of those of the company 
the company faces competition principally in establishing trade credit  pricing of available materials and quality of service 
in its oil and gas operation  the company also competes for the acquisition of mineral properties 
the company s marketing division competes with major oil companies and other large industrial concerns that own or control significant refining and marketing facilities 
these major oil companies may offer their products to others on more favorable terms than those available to the company 
from time to time in recent years  there have been supply imbalances for crude oil and natural gas in the marketplace 
this in turn has led to significant fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas 
as a result  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the future market price for crude oil and natural gas and the available margin spread between wholesale acquisition costs and sales realization 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates fair value accounting as an integral part of its marketing operation  the company enters into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related accounting pronouncements 
management believes this required accounting  commonly called mark to market accounting  creates variations in reported earnings and the reported earnings trend 
under mark to market accounting  significant levels of earnings are recognized in the period of contract initiation rather than the period when the service is provided and title passes from supplier to customer 
as it affects the company s operation  management believes mark to market accounting impacts reported earnings and the presentation of financial condition in three important ways 
gross margins  derived from certain aspects of the company s ongoing business  are front ended into the period in which contracts are executed 
meanwhile  personnel and other costs associated with servicing accounts as well as the substantially all risks associated with the execution of contracts are incurred during the period of physical product flow and title passage 
mark to market earnings are calculated based on stated contract volumes 
a significant risk associated with the company s business is the conversion of stated contract or planned volumes into actual physical commodity movement volumes without a loss of margin 
again  any planned profit from such commodity contracts is bunched and front ended into one period while the risk of loss associated with the difference between actual versus planned production or usage volumes falls in a subsequent period 
cash flows  by their nature  match physical movements and passage of title 
mark to market accounting  on the other hand  creates a mismatch between reported earnings and cash flows 
this complicates and confuses the picture of stated financial conditions and liquidity 
the company attempts to mitigate the identified risks by only entering into contracts where current market quotes in actively traded  liquid markets are available to determine the fair value of contracts 
in addition  substantially all of the company s forward contracts are less than months in duration 
however  the reader is cautioned to develop a full understanding of how fair value or mark to market accounting creates reported results that differ from those presented under conventional accrual accounting 
trade accounts accounts receivable and accounts payable typically represent the most significant assets and liabilities of the company 
particularly within the company s energy marketing  oil and gas exploration  and production operations  there is a high degree of interdependence with and reliance upon third parties  including transaction counterparties to provide adequate information for the proper recording of amounts receivable or payable 
substantially all such third parties are larger firms providing the company with the source documents for recording trade activity 
it is commonplace for these entities to retroactively adjust or correct such documents 
this typically requires the company to either absorb  benefit from  or pass along such corrections to another third party 
due to a the volume of transactions  b the complexity of transactions and c the high degree of interdependence with third parties  this is a difficult area to control and manage 
the company manages this process by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of its counterparties 
ongoing account balances are monitored monthly and the company attempts to gain the cooperation of such counterparties to reconcile outstanding balances 
the company also places great emphasis on collecting cash balances due and paying only bonafide properly supported claims 
in addition  the company maintains and monitors its bad debt allowance 
a degree of risk remains  however  due to the custom and practices of the industry 
oil and gas reserve estimate the value of capitalized cost of oil and gas exploration and production related assets are dependent on underlying oil and gas reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are based on many subjective factors 
the accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data  production performance data and reservoir engineering data  changed prices  as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data 
the process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision of estimates usually on an annual basis as additional information becomes available 
estimated future oil and gas revenue calculations are also based on estimates by petroleum engineers as to the timing of oil and gas production  and there is no assurance that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such estimates 
also  certain assumptions must be made with respect to pricing 
the company s estimates assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer s estimates  except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts 
there can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions  governmental regulation and other factors impact the market price for oil and gas 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  so only costs including development dry hole costs associated with producing oil and gas wells are capitalized 
estimated oil and gas reserve quantities are the basis for the rate of amortization under the company s units of production method for depreciating  depleting and amortizing of oil and gas properties 
estimated oil and gas reserve values also provide the standard for the company s periodic review of oil and gas properties for impairment 
contingencies from time to time as incident to its operations  the company becomes involved in various accidents  lawsuits and or disputes 
primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet  the company is a party to motor vehicle accidents  worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as are typical for the industry 
in addition  the company has extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws  environmental laws and labor laws  among others 
should an incident occur  management evaluates the claim based on its nature  the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage 
to the extent management believes that such event may impact the financial condition of the company  management will estimate the monetary value of the claim and make appropriate accruals or disclosure as provided in the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revenue recognition the company s natural gas and crude oil marketing customers are invoiced based on contractually agreed upon terms on a monthly basis 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer 
where required  the company also recognizes fair value or mark to market gains and losses related to its natural gas and crude oil trading activities 
a detailed discussion of the company s risk management activities is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
customers of the company s petroleum products marketing subsidiary are invoiced and revenue is recognized in the period when the customer physically takes possession and title to the product upon delivery at their facility 
transportation customers are invoiced  and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
oil and gas revenue from the company s interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and gas passes to the purchaser 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which established accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas no

as of december  the company had no stock based employee compensation plans  nor any other share based payment arrangements 
on november   the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires that these items be charged to expense regardless of whether they meet the so abnormal criterion outlined in accounting research bulletin this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have any effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb no 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the statement specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date this statement is issued 
retroactive application is not permitted 
management is analyzing the requirements of this new statement and believes that its adoption will not have any significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk includes potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk total long term debt at december  included  of floating rate debt 
as a result  the company s annual interest costs fluctuate based on interest rate changes 
because the interest rate on the company s long term debt is a floating rate  the fair value approximates carrying value as of december  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have had a material effect on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  commodity price risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its marketing and production of crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing spot prices applicable to oil and gas 
commodity price risk in the company s marketing operations represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of an asset or a commitment 
from time to time  the company enters into forward contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on its purchases of crude oil and natural gas 
the company may also enter into price support contracts with certain customers to secure a floor price on the purchase of certain supply 
in each instance  the company locks in a separate matching price support contract with a third party in order to minimize the risk of these financial instruments 
substantially all forward contracts fall within a six month to one year term with no contracts extending longer than two years in duration 
the company monitors all commitments and positions and endeavors to maintain a balanced portfolio 
certain forward contracts are recorded at fair value  depending on management s assessments of numerous accounting standards and positions that comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
the undiscounted fair value of such contracts is reflected on the company s balance sheet as risk management assets and liabilities 
the revaluation of such contracts is recognized on a net basis in the company s results of operations 
current market price quotes from actively traded liquid markets are used in all cases to determine the contracts undiscounted fair value 
regarding net risk management assets  percent of presented values as of december  and were based on readily available market quotations 
risk management assets and liabilities are classified as short term or long term depending on contract terms 
the estimated future net cash inflow based on year end market prices is  all to be received in the estimated future cash inflow approximates the net fair value recorded in the company s risk management assets and liabilities 
the following table illustrates the factors impacting the change in the net value of the company s risk management assets and liabilities for the year ended december  in thousands 
net fair value on january  activity during cash received from settled contracts net realized gain from prior years contracts net unrealized gain from current year contracts net fair value on december  historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility is expected to continue 
from january  through december  natural gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of mmbtu to a monthly high of per mmbtu 
oil prices ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during the same period 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in average natural gas and crude oil prices  assuming no changes in volume levels  would have reduced earnings by approximately  and  respectively  for the comparative years ended december  and
