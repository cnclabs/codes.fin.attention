the acquired business had six offices serving approximately customers with more than it professionals 
summary of cash flows for fiscal years and fy fy change change net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents n a net increase in cash the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable payments in fy and the effect of the change in accounts receivable balance in fy compared to the change in fy  partially offset by the increase in net income 
a portion of this increase was used to pay for capital expenditures and to complete the acquisition of the canadian test laboratory 
cash used in financing activities increased as borrowings on current and long term debt were higher than repayments 
overall  net cash increased by  in fiscal  compared to an increase of  in fiscal critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are derived from development  qualification and production testing and engineering services for commercial products  space systems and military equipment of all types 
the company also provides technical staffing  qualification of safety related systems and components  and iso certification services 
revenues from fixed price testing contracts are recorded upon completion of contracts  which are generally short term  or identifiable contractual tasks 
at the time the company enters into a contract that includes multiple tasks  the company estimates the amount of actual labor and other costs that will be required to complete each task based on historical experience 
milestone payments related to each task are then established in the contract  which provide for a normal profit margin relative to similar testing performed for similar tasks historically 
revenues relative to each task and from contracts which are time and materials based are recorded as effort is expended hours charged 
billings in excess of amounts earned are deferred 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to income when identified 
to the extent management does not accurately forecast the level of effort required to complete a contract  or individual tasks within a contract  and the company is unable to negotiate additional billings with a customer for cost over runs  the company may incur losses on individual contracts 
all selling  general and administrative costs are treated as period costs and expensed as incurred 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company uses a combination of write off history  aging analysis and any specific known troubled accounts in determining the allowance 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventories inventories consist of accumulated costs including direct labor  material and overhead applicable to uncompleted contracts and are stated at actual cost  which is not in excess of estimated net realizable value 
such inventories for each contract are reviewed on a monthly basis over the life of the contract and additional write downs of inventories are made if there are insufficient revenues remaining on the contract 
deferred income taxes at january   the company has recorded a net deferred tax asset of  the company has recorded this asset as it believes that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize the asset through reduction of future taxable income 
the company bases this belief upon the levels of taxable income historically generated by its business  as well as projections of future taxable income 
if future levels of taxable income are not consistent with its expectations  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance  which could reduce its net income by a material amount 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  based on their fair values 
accounting for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method supplemented by pro forma disclosures will no longer be permissible 
the new statement will be effective for nts in the fiscal year beginning february the company has not yet completed its analysis of the impact of adopting sfas r and is therefore currently unable to quantify the effect on its financial statements 
however  the adoption of this new statement will have a significant impact on the results of operations and net income per share of the company as the company will be required to expense the fair value of all share based payments 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements

the company also provides iso quality management system registration 
the defense and aerospace markets generate of the overall engineering and evaluation revenues 
in recent years  domestic and worldwide political and economic developments have impacted positively the market needs for defense and advanced technology systems 
also  the increase in government outsourcing activity has created additional opportunities for nts 
the company has ten fully equipped defense and aerospace environmental simulation laboratories located throughout the united states and is well equipped to handle this increase in demand 
after the incident  the company has seen an increase in demand for the evaluation of military equipment and weapons systems  which has positively affected business at the company s arkansas facility 
nts has installed a new rocket firing range and has upgraded it s capability to handle large weapons systems as well as maintaining shock machines  centrifuges  acoustical chambers  hydraulic and electro dynamic vibration equipment 
the company believes it operates more of these systems than any other company 
the company anticipates the level of need will increase for the foreseeable future and has expanded its service offering  particularly at the camden  arkansas facility and the tinton falls  new jersey facility to handle the anticipated increase in demand 
the telecommunications market in the past three years has not been favorable 
the company has experienced a decline in business in this market 
the outlook for the foreseeable future appears favorable  however  due to the increase in product certification outsourcing by the major regional bell operating companies rbocs 
the company has been approved as an independent test laboratory itl by the rbocs to test and certify central office equipment developed by manufactures to the network equipment building specifications nebs 
the company is currently providing this service at laboratories in california  massachusetts  texas  alberta  canada and germany 
the company has been approved as an itl to offer a complete suite of passive fiber components certifications and digital subscriber line dsl certification 
this service currently is being provided at laboratories in california 
the company expects an increase in business demand as rbocs upgrade networks packet based voice over internet protocol voip devices 
as service providers gradually convert to voip architectures  interoperability becomes critical to ensure a seamless transition to next generation networks 
the company also expects an increase in demand as carriers begin to deploy triple play voice  video  and broadband offerings over fttp fiber to the premise passive fiber networks 
the company recently acquired a network architecture and interoperability laboratory in northern california 
this laboratory was acquired to extend the company s service offering to handle the anticipated demand for interoperability testing and the fttp deployment 
the transportation and power markets have been stable with the company experiencing slight incremental growth in the transportation business  while the company is experiencing no growth in the power business 
the company anticipates that these two markets will remain stable with no significant external growth 
the computer and electronics markets have been stable with the company experiencing growth in the japan operation 
this growth is directly attributed to the usb certification technology transfer that was completed this year 
the company anticipates growth in these markets as the international expansion strategy is deployed this year 
development plans include cooperative agreements in taiwan  hong kong and mainland china 
the cooperative agreements will focus on providing usb  usb on the go  connector and zigbee certification to device manufacturers and industrial products manufactured in asia 
the company believes that the demand for these certification activities will increase in asia 
in the technical solutions segment  the company provides a variety of staffing and workforce management services and solutions  including contract  contract to hire and full time placements to meet its customers needs with a focus on it development 
the it general services business is extremely competitive with a portion of this work being outsourced to off shore providers 
the company has experienced a decline in the general service it business as a result of the current adverse market trends 
to offset this competitive environment  the company is deploying a migration strategy focusing on meeting the anticipated increase in demand for specialized compliance and engineering support services at company locations as well as taking advantage of offshore opportunities 
the company is now offering a specialized niche oriented compliance and engineering service 
this service is being deployed by cross selling to the clients currently being serviced by the engineering and evaluation segment 
the company has also set up a test and compliance laboratory in vietnam for a major us fortune computer company to take advantage of the low cost highly skilled labor in vietnam 
the company believes it has a competitive advantage because of the existing relationships with the engineering and evaluation clients and anticipates the specialized compliance and engineering service need will continue to grow both domestically as well as internationally as a result of the continued outsourcing trend 
notwithstanding the foregoing and because of factors affecting the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its long term revolving line of credit arrangement 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical one percentage point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect interest expense by  at january  as compared with  at january  risks that could affect future results the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements in this form k 
any of the following risks may have a material negative impact on the company s financial condition 
the company is subject to the effects of general economic and market conditions including economic disruption caused by terrorist acts 
if the economic conditions worsen  the company may experience material adverse effects on its business  operating results  and financial condition 
results may be adversely affected by the loss of significant customers or significant decreases in their purchasing volume  pricing concessions that may be given on volume sales due to competition  the rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders  fluctuations and availability of certain raw materials or components that are needed to test customers products  the loss of key management or technical personnel  the financial condition of the company s major customers  fraudulent transactions committed against the company  us government defense programs are subject to special risk  including dependence on government appropriations  contract termination without cause  contract renegotiations  and intense competition for the available defense business  inability to find temporary workers with the skills required by customers in the technical solutions segment  the inability to procure sufficient insurance to cover operational and contractual risks  program performance including the ability to perform fixed price contracts within estimated costs and the timing of test report deliveries  future changes in zoning could adversely affect the company s ability to fully utilize its facilities to service its clients  the company s california facilities  including its principal executive offices  are located near major earthquake fault lines 
a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region near any of the company s facilities  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  to remain competitive  the company must be able to respond effectively to technological changes and be able to hire  train and retain highly skilled sales  engineering and technical personnel 
environmental matters an internal environmental compliance group formed in continues to review environmental matters for the company 
although the company s business does not involve the manufacture or extensive use of hazardous substances  the company does have a program to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws at its various testing facilities  which includes conducting regular internal audits to identify and categorize potential environmental exposure 
the company s santa clarita  california test facility is located immediately adjacent to property owned by a third party which has been the subject of extensive environmental remediation 
the adjacent site has  in the past  been used for manufacture of solid rocket fuel propellants  munitions and flares that contained perchlorate  a hazardous substance 
soil samples taken from the santa clarita property in were inconclusive as to the existence of perchlorate 
recent heavy rainfall resulted in a run off from the adjacent site onto the santa clarita property 
the company arranged for samples to be taken of the surface water from the adjacent site and early indications are that the tested water contains high levels of perchlorate 
further testing is being conducted 
no cleanup activity has been conducted on the santa clarita property and it has yet to be determined whether remediation will be required at the site  or  if required  the extent and cost of any remediation 
the company believes that in the event it does incur remediation costs that it will have valid claims for indemnification against the owner of the adjacent site and the municipality that built a road between the adjacent site and the santa clarita property that appears to have contributed to the runoff from the adjacent site 
recovery of such remediation costs may  however  be uncertain and may involve significant litigation expense 
impact of inflation the company continues to incur increased costs in the areas of wages  insurance  workers compensation  and utilities which it cannot pass along to customers in the current economic environment 
to date  these increases have been partially offset by reductions in other operating areas through improved efficiencies 
the company can give no assurances  however  that in the future it can offset such increased costs

and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements january   and summary of significant accounting policies principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of national technical systems  inc nts or the company and its subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the company has consolidated nqa  inc  a owned subsidiary for which the distribution of profits and losses is to the company  and to the other shareholder 
nts controls the management decisions and elects the president of nqa  inc and therefore has complete operating control of the subsidiary 
xxcal japan is a owned subsidiary which started in fiscal and is accounted for under the equity method since nts does not have management or board control 
the equity investment is   and  at january   and  respectively 
risks and uncertainties the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates made by the company relate primarily to the recognition of revenue under long term contracts and valuation of contract claims 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral 
revenue recognition revenues are derived from development  qualification and production testing and engineering services for commercial products  space systems and military equipment of all types 
the company also provides technical staffing  qualification of safety related systems and components  and iso certification services 
revenue from fixed price testing contracts is recorded upon completion of the contracts  which are generally short term  or identifiable contractual tasks 
at the time the company enters into a contract that includes multiple tasks  the company estimates the amount of actual labor and other costs that will be required to complete each task based on historical experience 
milestone payments related to each task are then established in the contract  which provide for a normal profit margin relative to similar testing performed for similar tasks historically 
revenue relative to each task and from contracts which are time and materials based is recorded as effort is expended hours charged 
billings in excess of amounts earned are deferred 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to income when identified 
all selling  general and administrative costs are treated as period costs and expensed as incurred 
reimbursements  including those related to travel and other out of pocket expenses are included in revenues and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in operating costs and expenses

national technical systems  inc 
and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued january   and summary of significant accounting policies continued under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment 
the goodwill test for impairment consists of a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step of the test is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test includes a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit that has associated goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting unit 
the company has identified two reporting units in the engineering and evaluation segment and one reporting unit in the technical solutions segment  which constitute components of its business that include goodwill 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test and has determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded the reporting unit s carrying amount  and no impairment was indicated 
long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  and intangible assets with determinable lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
the company evaluates events or changes in circumstances based on a number of factors including operating results  business plans and forecasts  general and industry trends and  economic projections and anticipated cash flows 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amounts 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in earnings 
stock based compensation the company has elected to continue to follow apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for its employee stock options because  as discussed below  the alternative fair value accounting provided under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recognized in the company s financial statements  since the exercise price of the company s employee stock options is not less than the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by sfas no 
this information is required to be determined as if the company had accounted for its employee stock options granted subsequent to january  under the fair value method of that statement 
the fair value of options granted reported below has been estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions expected life in years risk free interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield national technical systems  inc 
and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued january   and summary of significant accounting policies continued the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of the traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility 
because the company s options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in the opinion of management  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its options 
the weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during was per share 
had compensation cost for the company s stock option plan been determined consistent with the fair value method outlined in sfas no 
 the company s net income loss and earnings loss per share would have been as indicated below january  january  january  net income loss as reported pro forma basic earnings loss per common share as reported pro forma diluted earnings loss per common share as reported pro forma comprehensive income in accordance with sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  the company is required to report and display the components of comprehensive income including unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments 
comprehensive income was  for fiscal year there was no comprehensive income or loss in fiscal year accumulated other comprehensive loss was  and  as of january  and  respectively  due to foreign currency translation adjustments 
earnings per share basic and diluted net income per common share is presented in conformity with sfas no 
 earnings per share for all periods presented 
in accordance with sfas no 
 basic earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year 
basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options  warrants and convertible securities 
foreign currency translation the accounts of the foreign divisions are translated into united states dollars in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
all balance sheet accounts have been translated using the current rate of exchange at the balance sheet date 
results of operations have been translated using the average rates prevailing throughout the year 
translation gains or losses resulting from the changes in the exchange rates from year to year are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders equity 
in national technical systems  inc

reclassifications certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year financial statement presentation 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  based on their fair values 
accounting for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method supplemented by pro forma disclosures will no longer be permissible 
the new statement will be effective for nts in the fiscal year beginning february the company has not yet completed its analysis of the impact of adopting sfas r and is therefore currently unable to quantify the effect on its financial statements 
however  the adoption of this new statement will have a significant impact on the results of operations and net income per share of the company as the company will be required to expense the fair value of all share based payments
