item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general 
our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to us individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios 
investors outside the united states have grown over the last four years and account for more than of our assets under management at december  we manage a broad range of us and international stock  bond  and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors 
investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management 
accordingly  fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 
financial market results during were strong  though largely the result of a strong boost to the equity markets in the fourth quarter 
stock indexes closed the first quarter near the levels of the beginning of the year 
the second quarter saw us stocks produce slightly positive returns while third quarter losses across the markets resulted in negative returns at the end of nine months 
investor concerns about the strength of the economy  rising interest rates  global political risks  national elections  and record high oil prices all weighed heavily on the markets 
after the november elections in the us  the financial markets began rising to end on a positive note 
for the first time since  the stock markets in the us rose for two consecutive years 
the broad s p index rose just under during and the dow industrials finished the year up over 
the nasdaq index  which is heavily weighted with technology companies  finished up nearly 
the federal reserve began the first of five increases in the federal funds target rate on june  the first rate increases in four years 
despite these rate increases  yields on year us treasuries were basically flat for the year 
in this financial environment  total assets under our management ended at a record billion  up more than billion during the year 
improving financial market valuations and income added billion to our assets under management during while net investor inflows added a record billion 
year end assets under management consist of billion in equity securities and billion in bond and money market holdings 
these investment assets include more than billion in the t 
rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and nearly billion in other investment portfolios that include separately managed accounts  sub advised funds  and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the united states and through variable annuity life insurance plans 
of significant importance to our growth in assets under management during  net cash inflows were very strong and at record levels 
in total  investors entrusted billion more to our management  including nearly billion into the us mutual funds and billion from across the world into the other portfolios that we manage 
the previous record net inflows to our us mutual funds were billion in our strong relative investment performance and brand awareness have contributed significantly to obtaining these new assets for investment management 
page of as a result of the disclosures of trading abuses at several investment management firms beginning in september  the investment management industry and mutual funds in particular have come under greater regulatory scrutiny 
some regulations designed to strengthen controls and restore investor confidence in the industry were enacted in and more are expected in the coming months 
in an improving market environment for  we would expect to increase our expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients 
these efforts may involve significant costs that precede the recognition of any future revenues that we may realize from increases to our assets under management 
results of operations 
versus both net revenues and total revenues increased more than million to nearly billion

administrative fees and other income increased million during to nearly million 
the change in these revenues includes million from our mutual fund transfer agent services  including our defined contribution plan recordkeeping service 
additionally  revenues increased million from b distribution fees received on greater assets under management in the advisor and r classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares 
these changes page of in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that we incur to provide these services and distribute the advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares through third party financial intermediaries 
operating expenses in were million more than in the prior year 
our largest expense  compensation and related costs  increased or million from the number of our associates  their compensation  and the costs of their employee benefits have all increased 
our bonus program was higher than the prior year based on our better operating results and the strong relative investment performance that our investment managers achieved 
base salaries for our associates were increased modestly on january  and we added more than associates during  primarily to handle volume related activities and business growth 
at december   we employed  associates 
advertising and promotion expenditures during were up million compared to we expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in the first quarter of will be similar to the fourth quarter of  with succeeding quarters in being higher than those of the corresponding quarters 
while market conditions will dictate the exact level of our spending  we expect that our advertising and promotion expenditures for the year will be to higher than in we vary our promotional spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the united states and abroad 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in  offsetting the increase of million in other occupancy and facility costs 
longer lived buildings and non depreciable land account for two thirds of the net book value of our property and equipment at december  costs of rented facilities and related operating costs were higher in other operating expenses in increased million  including million paid based on greater assets under management that are sourced through financial intermediaries that distribute our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares 
these costs are funded from an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from b fees as discussed above 
for  we increased our charitable contribution to our corporate foundation by million 
other operating expenses this year have risen to meet increased business demands 
they include  among other things  travel costs  information services  and professional fees for legal  audit  and consulting services and regulatory compliance 
in the past  we have made modest use of fully permissible payments by brokers to obtain third party investment research and related services 
after careful evaluation during  we decided to phase out these arrangements and to pay for all third party investment research and related services directly 
the impact of this decision to our earnings per share is less than 
per quarter 
overall  net operating income for increased million  or  from our net non operating income  which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses as well as interest income and credit facility expenses  increased million from to million 
greater cash balances and higher interest rates in added million  greater returns on fund investments added million  and gains recognized from the sale of investments in sponsored mutual funds added million 
foreign currency balances produced exchange rate gains of more than million in compared with losses of million on our yen denominated debt before it was repaid in page of late interest and related credit facility costs were down 
million in as we repaid all outstanding debt in and reduced the size and cost of our credit facilities on an ongoing basis in the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is for  down from greater tax exempt and non taxable dividend income  use of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  and settlements of prior year taxes at lower rates all contributed to this lower rate

rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states increased million on higher average assets under management which increased billion from billion in to billion in market appreciation and income  net of dividends paid and not reinvested  added billion to mutual fund assets during and net investor inflows added another billion 
as a result  fund assets under management increased from billion at the beginning of to billion at december  stock funds had net investor subscriptions of billion while bond and money market funds added net inflows of billion 
investors in the mid cap growth  equity income  and growth stock funds accounted for billion of the net inflows during the year

fees from our managed disposition service for equity securities distributed from venture capital investment pools accounted for million of the advisory revenue increase 
though recurring  these fees will vary significantly over time and through different phases of the market cycle 
administrative revenues and other income increased million to million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased b distribution fees received based on greater assets under management in the advisor class shares of our sponsored mutual funds and to the transfer agency and participant recordkeeping services that we provide for defined contribution retirement plans 
these revenue changes are generally offset by similar changes in the expenses that we incur to distribute the advisor shares through third parties and provide the services to the retirement plans

operating expenses in were million higher than in our largest expense  compensation and related costs  including bonuses  increased to million

page of depreciation and amortization expense decreased million 
new capital additions in were less than depreciation expense and the depreciable book value of our property and equipment is lower than in the prior year

overall  net operating income for increased nearly million  or  from our net non operating results  which include the recognition of investment gains and losses as well as interest and credit facility expenses  improved from a loss of million in to a gain of 
million in during  we recognized net investment losses of million on our mutual fund investments  private equity investments  and our investments in sponsored collateralized bond obligations 
interest and related costs were down 
million from as we repaid all of our outstanding debt obligations during the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is slightly higher than that of due primarily to credits in the year arising from lower than previously estimated state income tax liabilities 
capital resources and liquidity 
during  stockholders equity increased from billion to billion

operating activities provided cash flows of million in  up million from  including million of increased net income 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million and net cash used in financing activities totaled million in net cash expended in investing activities increased million versus our net cash investments in sponsored mutual funds increased million and our capital expenditures increased million 
offsetting these amounts was million of lower net savings bank investments due to lower net depositor inflows in net cash used in financing activities decreased million versus increased stock option exercises due to our higher common stock valuations generated million of greater cash proceeds in in we also repaid our last outstanding debt of nearly million 
offsetting these changes were the larger million of new savings bank deposits received in and million more in dividends paid in we again increased dividends paid to our stockholders in and raised our quarterly rate from

comparatively  operating activities in provided cash flows of million in  up million from  including million of increased net income offset by lower depreciation expense of million 
cash from our operating activities were used to fund million of net investing activities and million of net financing activities in net cash expended in investing activities in decreased million versus primarily due to the investment of the more than million of greater net depositor inflows made at our savings bank subsidiary in net cash used in financing activities decreased more than million versus we repurchased fewer common shares in and funded them entirely from the page of proceeds of stock option exercises 
in  we expended a net of more than million on greater share repurchase activity while also receiving the larger million net inflow of new savings bank deposits 
we again increased dividends paid to our stockholders in property and equipment expenditures in  including those for our build out of business continuity facilities and supporting operations  are anticipated to be about million and are expected to be funded from operating cash flows 
contractual obligations 
the following table presents a summary of our future obligations under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december  other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees 
because these obligations are of a normal recurring nature  we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations 
the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in and future years 
in millions total later noncancelable operating leases other purchase commitments we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional equity investments totaling million at december  critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives 
further  significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet  the revenues and expenses in our statement of income  and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to the financial statements 
making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time 
accordingly  actual amounts or future results could differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our financial statements and notes thereto 
we have historically presented those significant accounting policies that we use in the preparation of our financial statements as an integral part of those statements and have done so again in this annual report 
in the following discussion  we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities 
we classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available for sale 
at the end of each quarter  we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that loss or impairment is other than temporary 
page of a mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months is presumed to have an other than temporary loss and an impairment is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence  such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end  to overcome that presumption 
we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near term recovery is possible 
a debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary that is impaired is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we recognize in our income statement whenever we determine that we will probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security based on the issuer s financial condition and our intent to hold that security 
minor impairments of or less that arise from changes in interest rates and not credit quality are generally considered temporary 
goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach 
we attribute all goodwill to our single reportable business segment and reporting unit  our investment advisory business 
goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business 
our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeds the carrying amount basically  our stockholders equity and  therefore  that no impairment exists 
should we reach a different conclusion when we conduct our evaluation in future years  additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non cash impairment charge to be recognized 
we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred 
the maximum possible future impairment charge that we could incur is the total goodwill recognized in our balance sheet  million 
provision for income taxes 
after compensation and related costs  our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense 
we operate in several states and several other countries through our various subsidiaries  and must allocate our income  expenses  and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions 
accordingly  our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations 
annually  we file tax returns which represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities 
each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations 
from time to time  we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to  or in the process of  being audited by various tax authorities 
because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates  it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements 
as a result  it is likely that additions to  or reductions of  income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 
stock options 
the summary of significant accounting policies includes certain pro forma disclosures as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize compensation expense associated with our stock option grants 
fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter term  market traded financial page of instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration 
the black scholes option pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations  including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date  the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period  and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time 
additionally  the recognition of expense fluctuates based on the forfeiture rate for unvested options when employees leave our company 
the tax benefit will also fluctuate based on the extent to which our associates disqualify their incentive stock option grants 
our estimates for the variables used in the valuation model are made for the purpose of estimating an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted 
unlike almost all other expenses  the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non cash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 
newly issued accounting pronouncement on stock options 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb revised statement no 
 share based payment  which will require us to recognize stock option based compensation expense in our income statement beginning in the third quarter of the calculation of compensation expense to then be recognized is similar to that used in our pro forma disclosures discussed above  except that we will also include a reduction for estimated future forfeitures 
these estimates will be adjusted over time to reflect actual forfeitures 
at december   we had  options outstanding that will vest over the remaining period through december compensation expense to be recognized in future periods as these options vest  and the related tax benefits  will be amortized as follows compensation income tax expense benefits net effect st half nd half total these amounts will change to reflect future option grants  estimated and actual forfeitures  and tax benefits that arise upon the future disqualification of incentive stock option grants 
it is important to note that the use of the fair value method to record compensation expense for stock based plans does not diminish total stockholders equity 
forward looking information 
from time to time  information or statements provided by or on behalf of t 
rowe price  including those within this annual report  may contain certain forward looking information  including information or anticipated information relating to changes in our revenues and net income  changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management  our expense levels  and our expectations regarding financial markets and other conditions 
readers are cautioned that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of page of t 
rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance 
actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information because of various factors including  but not limited to  those discussed below 
further  forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management 
such changes result from many factors including  among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t 
rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios  fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management  our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios  and changes in retirement savings trends favoring participant directed investments and defined contribution plans 
the ability to attract and retain investors assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence  the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indices  the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels  competitive conditions in the mutual fund  asset management  and broader financial services sectors  and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business 
our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements 
our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses  which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions  including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the united states  variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  bonuses  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  any goodwill impairment that may arise  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations  expenses and capital costs  such as technology assets  depreciation  amortization  and research and development  incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure  unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients  and disruptions of services  including those provided by third parties  such as facilities  communications  power  and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 
our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation  and changes in legal  regulatory  accounting  tax  and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results  including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general  or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management 
accordingly  declines in financial market values directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income 
page of we invest in our sponsored mutual funds  which are market risk sensitive financial instruments held for purposes other than trading  we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments 
mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk  that is  the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the mutual fund shares 
each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices  credit ratings  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates 
the following table in thousands of dollars presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares 
this potential future loss of value  before any income tax benefits  reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund s lowest fair value per share during in considering this presentation  it is important to note that all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day  it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted  and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 
fair value at potential december  of lower of potential portfolio value portfolio loss stock funds bond funds the comparable potential loss of value shown in last year s annual report was million on sponsored mutual fund investments of million at the end of during  we actually experienced net unrealized gains of million as positive market conditions significantly improved the value of our fund investments over the course of the year 
investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds  by their nature  are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments 
t 
rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds 
in addition  investment holdings may be altered from time to time  in response to changes in market risks and other factors  as deemed appropriate by management 
the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk 
if interest rates change  the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material 
we also make other investments that we include in our balance sheet in other assets 
we are at risk for losses on these investments should market conditions deteriorate 
at december   we hold a million investment in a sponsored high yield collateralized bond obligation and investments totaling million in private equity and other entities 
our risk of future loss on these investments cannot exceed the million recognized in our balance sheet 
additionally  we have recognized our yen investment in a interest of daiwa sb investments japan at million using the historical cost basis of accounting 
our market risk on this investment is primarily limited to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
the us dollar weakened versus the currencies of several foreign countries in which we operate  most prominent among which is great britain 
we incur operating expenses and have foreign currency denominated assets and page of liabilities associated with these operations  though our revenue stream is predominately realized in us dollar receipts 
we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially impact our results of operations
